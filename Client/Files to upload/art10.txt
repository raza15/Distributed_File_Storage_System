    John Michael Osbourne, (known as "Ozzy" to his fans), has in his long 
career as vocalist for Black Sabbath had his work with the group misconstrued 
as advocating Satanism.  In a 1983 radio special featuring Ozzy, the 
interviewer expressed precisely this point; "...Ozzy has always been shrouded 
in the darkest of Satanic imagery.  Yet if you really listen to his music, 
you'll find that what he is saying differs greatly from his image...."(1)  Even 
the group's image has often been described as "occult and diabolic".(2)

    The important point to remember here is to differentiate between appearance 
and reality.  Although the name "Black Sabbath" conjures up images of witches 
and sorcerers paying homage to Satan for the powers bestowed upon them, this 
does not make it safe to assume that the group that went by this name 
necessarily drew the inspiration from the occult.(3)  The closest they ever 
came to it was a gothic horror film featuring Boris Karloff as narrator; they 
adopted their name directly from the name of this film.(4)  Black Sabbath was 
involved in the black arts as much as Karloff practiced casting spells off-
screen.  Tony Iommi, the group's guitarist, summed it up best when he described 
the group as having basically "...the same appeal as a horror movie.  It's all 
an act."(5)










    Just as their film counterpart did, Ozzy and Sabbath found the occult 
mythos to be an effective vehicle for powerful social commentary; particularly 
when put in the context of heavy-metal rock and roll.  Ozzy himself noted that 
there are "...people who pick up my [album] cover[s] and go...'This guy's got 
to be singing about Devil, doom, death and destruction.'  Which is not the 
case...."(6)

    The late Lester Bangs likened the group to Bob Dylan and William Burroughs, 
describing them all as "...moralists...trying to deal with a serious present 
situation in an honest way...."(7)  Ozzy and Black Sabbath merely bring to 
light the many evils of our world in their work, to try and make us realize 
that we are all victim to their influence.  They hope to make us recognize 
these evils so that we may take up arms against them; a point Ozzy emphatically 
stresses:  "...one thing everybody has got to understand about Black Sabbath's 
lyrics.  They're not downer lyrics, they're just telling everybody where it's 
at..."(8)  He also cites the group's most controversial tune, "Black Sabbath", 
as a response to the ignorant hippie culture still force when the tune was 
written in 1970:  "The hippies said: 'The world is beautiful man.' (sic)  You 
only had to look around you to see how crappy it was.  It was ridiculous 
listening to that stuff, let alone playing it, so we just wrote about the world 
the way it really was and how it affected us - and we felt better in ourselves 
because we were really being honest...."(9)

    I   1   HAVE YOU EVER THOUGH ABOUT YOUR SOUL-
        2   CAN IT BE SAVED?
        3   OR PERHAPS YOU THINK THAT WHEN YOU ARE DEAD
        4   YOU JUST STAY IN YOUR GRAVE.
        5   IS GOD JUST A THOUGHT WITHIN YOUR HEAD OR IS
        6   HE A PART OF YOU?
        7   IS CHRIST JUST A NAME THAT YOU READ IN A BOOK
        8   WHEN YOU WERE AT SCHOOL?

    II  9   WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT DEATH DO YOU LOSE
        10  YOUR BREATH OR DO YOU KEEP YOUR COOL?
        11  WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE THE POPE ON THE END
        12  OF A ROPE - DO YOU THINK HE'S A FOOL?
        13  WELL I'VE SEEN THE TRUTH - YES I'VE SEEN 
        14  THE LIGHT AND I'VE CHANGED MY WAYS.
        15  AND I'LL BE PREPARED WHEN YOU'RE LONELY 
        16  AND SCARED AT THE END OF OUR DAYS.

    III 17  COULD IT BE YOU'RE AFRAID OF WHAT YOU'R
        18  FRIENDS MIGHT SAY 
        19  IF THEY NEW YOU BELIEVED IN GOD ABOVE
        20  THEY SHOULD REALISE BEFORE THE CRITICISE
        21  THAT GOD IS THE ONLY WAY TO LOVE.

    IV  23  IS YOUR MIND SO SMALL THAT YOU HAVE TO FALL
        24 IN WITH THE PACK WHEREVER THEY RUN
        25  WILL YOU STILL SNEER WHEN DEATH IS NEAR
        26  AND SAY THEY MAY AS WELL WORSHIP THE SUN.

    V   27  I THINK IT WAS TRUE IT WAS PEOPLE LIKE YOU
        28  THAT CRUCIFIED CHRIST
        29  I THINK IT IS SAD THE OPINION YOU HADE WAS THE
        30  ONLY ONE VOICED.
        31  WILL YOU BE SO SURE WHEN YOUR DAY IS NEAR
        32  SAY YOU DON'T BELIEVE?
        33  YOU HAD THE CHANCE BUT YOU TURNED IT DOWN
        34  NOW YOU CAN'T RETRIEVE.










    VI  35  PERHAPS YOU'LL THINK BEFORE YOU SAY THAT
        36  GOD IS DEAD AND GONE
        37  OPEN YOUR EYES, JUST REALIZE THAT HE IS THE
        38  ONE.
        39  THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN SAVE YOU KNOW FROM
        40  ALL THIS SIN AND HATE.
        41  OR WILL YOU STILL JEER AT ALL YOU HEAR?
        42  YES!-I THINK IT'S TOO LATE.

    In this piece, the group asserts a belief in an afterlife and spiritual 
redemption.  As grisly as the image of a hanged pontiff is, its shock value is 
a necessary part of the message:  They reject religious dogma, stating that a 
belief in God, in one's own heart, is the only guiding light to help one inn 
his life (lines 11/12, 39/40).  Furthermore, the reject religious hypocrisy 
(lines 5/6, 7/8) and peer pressure (verses III, IV) as excuses for not 
accepting God.  To clarify further:  following the crowd does not justify 
shrugging responsibility for one's own actions.

    After re-reading, it becomes obvious that this song is an ascerbic critique 
of atheism; (line 35/36) I refer here again to verses three and four.  In these 
two verses, the picture painted in one of Godless conformity and how it's 
viewed as being as foolish as Paganism.  These lyrics set an example for the 
listener by relating personal experience (lines 13-16).  However, for those who 
cannot accept this the group has no recourse but to condemn them, although 
rather ironically; they hope that their rhetorical loss of faith in the 
listener will open his eyes (line 42).

            WHAT IS THIS, THAT STANDS BEFORE ME?
            FIGURE IN BLACK, WHICH POINTS AT ME
            TURN ROUND QUICK AND START TO RUN
            FIND OUT I'M THE CHOSEN ONE.  OH, NO!
            
            BIG BLACK SHAPE WITH EYES OF FIRE
            TELLING PEOPLE THEIR DESIRE
            SATAN'S SITTING THERE, HE'S SMILING
            WATCHES THOSE FLAMES GET HIGHER AND HIGHER
            OH, NO, NO, -- PLEASE GOD HELP ME!
            
                IS THIS THE END MY FRIEND?
                SATAN'S COMING 'ROUND THE BEND
                PEOPLE RUNNING 'CAUSE THEY'RE SCARED
                THE PEOPLE BETTER GO AND BEWARE
                NO, NO!  PLEASE--NO!!
                
                
    The all time controversy winner!  Is this not irrefutably  THE song about 
Black Magic in rock?  It's all so obvious, suffuse with evil imagery; Satan, 
walls of flame, figure in black, and damnation at the end.  Yes, I see the 
images too; it definitely concerns Black Magic.  Then again, Shakespeare's 
Macbeth employed scenes of witches involved in conjurations; does that mean 
that Shakespeare was a warlock?  Poe used to write sardonic tragedies about 
twisted murderers and the bizarre nature of acts, did that make him an evil, 
leering, demented killer?  Did either of them advocated what they wrote about?  
One has to remember that writing about something is not necessarily the same as 
emulating it.  Tony Iommi spoke out quite strongly about this:  "People are 
bringing us down saying that we are a Black Magic group.  I think they must be










getting mixed up with Black Widow.  We don't do any sacrifices on stage, and 
we're not on a black magic kick.  We wanted to do heavy numbers and the guitar 
riffs we worked out were more suited to evil things than love.  We play songs 
about black magic, but they are more likely to be against than for it."(12)  

    By now, you're probably asking yourself who Black Widow is, right?  Then 
it's time for a little history:

        Sabbath, before they were known as Sabbath, had the same line-up but 
two earlier names.  The first one was Polka Tulk, which seemed sure to doom 
them to obscurity.(13)  The soon realized this and changed the group's name to 
Earth.  Now, Earth was a blues band at the end of the English blues boom.  As 
if that wasn't bad enough, they soon discovered that not only was there another 
group named Earth, but they had also released a single.  To avoid confusion, 
they changed their name again.(14)  But what made them decide on that name?  
Just ask Ozzy:  "I just liked the name Black Sabbath because of the succession 
of vowel sounds.(15)  If that sounds ludicrous just consider this:  Sabbath was 
"...the first of the really committed, loud and heavy bands..."(16)  They 
needed a name to match the gut-wrenching power they were developing.  Tony knew 
that he wanted Sabbath to be noticed above all the rest of the British blues 
bands:  "We wanted something of our own that we'd like and people would like.  
And we wanted something loud!"










    Tony didn't hate the blues.  He'd cut his teeth as a guitarist on the likes 
of The Shadows, Buddy Holly and Django Rheinhardt, developing his own style 
from there.  But he realized the group had no future in the blues:

        'We couldn't keep playing 12-bars forever.  We just got fed up with 
Earth music.  It was jazz, blues stuff.  It was good for practice but nothing 
else.'

    In the late 'Sixties, blues groups were a dime a dozen in Birmingham and 
interest was waning in the blues boom due to the glut of groups.  One man, by 
the name of Jim Simpson, had heard Earth around the Birmingham club circuit and 
understood what they were trying to do.  He decided to take them under his 
wing.  With the aid of his massive record collection, Jim expanded the group's 
horizons in the areas of jazz and blues.  He introduced them to artists like 
Wes Montgomery, Count Basie and Jimmy Rushing.  It was from Rushing in 
particular that they derived the repetitive riff style so readily noticeable in 
their later incarnation as Black Sabbath.

    The Count Basie influence is evidenced in the song "Wicked World" from the 
first album; Sabbath drummer Bill Ward uses a "'sighing hi-hat'...in the manner 
of Basie's drummer Jo Jones."










    The influence is subtle, almost subliminal.  Yet it is one which was not 
thought capable of hard, 'heavy' rock bands in the late 'Sixties.  Although Led 
Zeppelin and Jimi Hendrix also had their work steeped in blues and jazz 
derivations (Hendrix' "Third Stone From the Sun" and Zeppelin's version of 
Willie Dixon's "I Can't Quit You Baby" from their first album), neither was 
able to match the intense energy of Black Sabbath.  Iommi has always had a 
preference for music with an original, distinct style of its' own; as an 
example, he mentions guitarists Joe Pass and Alvin Lee as two of his strongest 
songwriting influences.

    It would also be necessary that Sabbath develop a unique, distinctive style 
and image of their own.  Though they had changed their name from Earth to Black 
Sabbath to avoid confusion with the other Earth; at the same time another group 
emerged by the name of Black Widow "...who WERE profoundly influenced by the 
occult, had a male witch as a patron, and wrote pieces like "Come to The 
Sabbat."  Unfortunately, Sabbath was constantly reaping the benefits of Widow's 
publicity.

    Sabbath was a group that never minced words.  If they saw something as 
destructive, they would be sure to rub the listener's face it it.  They did not 
want their point to be missed.

    With their straightforward, sometimes brutal way of looking at things, they 
try to shock the listener's conscience back into awareness.  The imagery of 
"Hand of Doom", from the Paranoid album, is candid and condemning; it is a 
strong statement against drug addiction and rightly so...

            YOU DON'T WANNA LEARN
            PRICE OF LIFE YOU CRY
            NOW YOU'RE GONNA DIE
            
            
    Many people felt the group's overall direction was pessimistic and had a 
negative effect on its listener's due to that.  "Ozzy insisted that if people 
thought he was having a bad effect on the minds of young kids, they should go 
and watch the TV news where real murder and mayhem were a way of life, and 
shown night after night." (18)

    Sabbath was never negative in their message; they were simply truthful 
about waht they saw as wrong in the world.  If you "Strip away the horror 
stories, the imagery and the hysteria, (and) turn down the amps a notch...you 
have a well-rehearsed, solid blues and rock band, powered by a dedication to 
well defined objectives."  On the top of the list of those objectives was 
truth; Sabbath never feared facing that truth squarely, regardless of what many 
people thought of them.

Long, long, time ago,
I can still remember,
When the local calls were "free".
And I knew if I paid my bill,
And never wished them any ill,
That the phone company would let me be...

But Uncle Sam said he knew better,
Split 'em up, for all and ever!
We'll foster competition:
It's good capital-ism!

I can't remember if I cried,
When my phone bill first tripled in size.
But something touched me deep inside,
The day... Bell System... died.

And we were singing...

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
"Our local calls have us in hock!" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

Is your office Step by Step,
Or have you gotten some Crossbar yet?
Everybody used to ask...
Oh, is TSPS coming soon?
IDDD will be a boon!
And, I hope to get a Touch-Tone phone, real soon...

The color phones are really neat,
And direct dialing can't be beat!
My area code is "low":
The prestige way to go!

Oh, they just raised phone booths to a dime!
Well, I suppose it's about time.
I remember how the payphones chimed,
The day... Bell System... died.

And we were singing...

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
"Our local calls have us in hock!" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

Back then we were all at one rate,
Phone installs didn't cause debate,
About who'd put which wire where...
Installers came right out to you,
No "phone stores" with their ballyhoo,
And 411 was free, seemed very fair!

But FCC wanted it seems,
To let others skim long-distance creams,
No matter 'bout the locals,
They're mostly all just yokels!

And so one day it came to pass,
That the great Bell System did collapse,
In rubble now, we all do mass,
The day... Bell System... died.

So bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
"Our local calls have us in hock!" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

I drove on out to Murray Hill,
To see Bell Labs, some time to kill,
But the sign there said the Labs were gone.
I went back to my old CO,
Where I'd had my phone lines, years ago,
But it was empty, dark, and ever so forlorn...

No relays pulsed,
No data crooned,
No MF tones did play their tunes,
There wasn't a word spoken,
All carrier paths were broken...

And so that's how it all occurred,
Microwave horns just nests for birds,
Everything became so absurd,
The day... Bell System... died.

So bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
"Our local calls have us in hock!" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

We were singing:

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
"Our local calls have us in hock!" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
                             *

   Gyrth Oldcastle wanted no hassle

   Bertrand de Flammepoing, he really must be aw-

   Vissevald he's the friend of the skald, he's

   There wasn't any like Gavin Kilkenny
   Known as crafty, keen, in battle tough!

   Michael of Bedford mounted throne-ward
   And the peasants all in peace did sleep

   Siegfried von Halstern, when it was his turn,

   Let us drink to King AElfwine, one who

   Morghun Sheridan had a Crown to win
   Which he did for one and all to see;

   The Fates were perusing; a King they were choosing

   Fredrick of Holland drank Imperium Compound

   When Setanta ascended the Eastern Throne

   When Setanta was the Crown Prince

   Imperium Compound is a manly brew
   As many a puissant Countess will assert!
   It makes you wonder about King Vissevald
   The King who wears a skirt!                            (16)

   Vissevald is King of the Eastland

              To Lily the Pink, the Pink, the Pink,
              The savior of the human ra-aa-ace.
              She invented Imperium Compound,
              Most effacatious in evr'y case.

   There was Horic, We thought he was sick,
   As a War-Puppy he was insane,
   Gave up Tranya for Imperium Compound,
   Now we have an Acid Reign!            //Oh wow, man!//   (18)

   This song'll bedevil the folks at a revel,

   Then King Richard, a bit of a bitch, heard

   Fredrick of Holland, who dwells in the Northland,

   Now Gyrth Oldcastle, round as a beer barrel,

   Many tales abound of Imperium Compound

                                             IMPERIUM COMPOUND    
                                             (Atenveldt Verses)

   Now here's a story, a little bit gory,
   A little bit happy, a little bit sad.
   About a drink called Imperium Compound
   And how the SCA's been had!                       

   Chorus: Oh we think, we think, we think,
           The King is a fink, a fink, a fink,
           A figure of respectability
           Rules the Kingdom thru Imperium Compound
           The results are plain to see!

   Mongol Hordemen, those free-living swordsmen
   Subverting the Kingdoms from underneath!
   Have no use for Imperium Compound
   Except perhaps to brush their teeth!

   AltChorus: Oh we fink, we fink, we fink,
              The Khan and the Kink, the Kink, the Kink,
              And the Board, their Great Senilities!
              The Western Irgun, drinks Imperium Compound
              And we're BACK, with results you'll see!    

   Lady Laurel, with Authority Royal,
   Passes and rejects our heraldry
   She needs a swig of Imperium Compound
   Then perhaps she'd deign to talk to me!            

   Lady Trude thought it her duty
   To turn a social wrong into a Right
   Proved her point with Imperium Compound
   And showed that Cheshire Cats can fight!  //and scratch//

   The Board of Directors styled themselves The Electors
   And another con they tried to swing
   Now the BoD drinks Imperium Compound
   So we no longer need a King!                        

   AltChorus: Oh the Bod, the BoD, the BoD,
              It thinks it is God, is God, is God,
              The figure of Supreme Authority!
              And if we O.D.'d on Imperium Compund
              there'd be no need for Royalty!          

   Oh, MEDIEVAL Net, we thought it was all wet
   With witty remarks, and other kinds of sass
   We'll feed our computers on Imperium Compound
   And BYTE the BoD right on its' righteous ass!         

   Good old Duncan was often drunken
   Chasing all the ladies fair
   He bathed himself in Imperium Compound
   Now he has a little savoir faire!                     

                    (more)


  ATEN IMPERIUM (cont.)

   Ioseph of Locksley, never changes his socks, he
   Runs around looking like a Cavalier,
   He stocked up on Imperium Compound
   And he has enough to last for years and years!        

   AltChorus: Oh they forgot, forgot, forgot
              The Locks-e-ly Plot, the Plot, the Plot!
              And it works the best when it is underground!
              It isn't a hassle for a green-and-white tassle
              They're the ones that BREW Imperium Compound!  

   Trelon of the Wood, he was very good, he
   Was a leader that had never been beat before;
   But Caid had Imperium Compound,
   And Imperial Roman Caid won the War!  //with help!//   

   In Tyr Ysgithr, it's regularly whispered there
   That the Kingdom is ruled over by a King    // What's THAT? //
   They're "democratic" and quite erratic....
   They've forgot the purpose of the whole damn thing!     

   King Sir Mark von, with his pretty white suit on,
   Rules the Kingdom both with Grace and Purity!
   He never touches Imperium Compound
   At least not where anyone else can see!               

   Duke Sir Deaton, was never beaten
   On the field, or in the drinking hall;
   At the Catbox War with Caid,
   Left thirty bodies piled against the wall!             

   Denis O'Titans was good at smitin'
   A Locksley Monster in every single way!
   Drank a little Imperium Compound
   And ATE Deaton's sword that day  // No! REALLY! //

                          WTP-0002C

        Last night I had the strangest dream in this bleak century
        I dreamed that people the world around believed in Chivalry

        I dreamed I saw a Kingly Crown enshrined in laurel leaves
        with Grace and Joy and Purity attendant at his feet

        I dreamed I saw the perfect Knight receive his accolade
        and minstrels sang and children laughed in some soft forest glade

        I dreamed I saw the finest thing that ever man could make
        grow great and strong and undefiled: Pray God I never wake!

        Last night I had the strangest dream in this bleak century
        I dreamed that people the world around believed in Chivalry

                Locksley Monsters never yield
                on the field of battle
                strike the helm and bash the shield
                make their eyeteeth rattle
                Bodies on the ground will lie
                bones will burst in sunder
                search for Locksleys' enemies:

                              SONG OF IVANOF

            There is a man who we know well that does the best he can
            but he's displayed in armour made of reticulated garbage cans!

            He looks so fine and fair and strong, oh how he plays the man
            and how it's prized, those galvanized, reticulated garbage cans

            The noblest Roman of them all, a good Praetorian
            a combatant who wears no pants, judst reticulated garbage cans!

            Like old Horatius at the Bridge, like the Legions of Valerian
            (O dearie me: those LOVELY knees!)
            and those reticulated garbage cans!

1.           The first time I sent my device, The Heralds said to me

            "It violates the Rule of Three"

2.           The next time I tried it, the Heralds said to me

            "We changed the forms, and it violates the Rule of
             Three".

3.           The third time I tried, and the Heralds said to me, 

            "We upped the fees, we changed the forms, and it
             violates the Rule of Three".

4.           Another time I tried and the Heralds said to me,
 
            "We haven't got it, we upped the fees, we changed the 
             forms, and it violates the Rule of Three".

5.           The fifth time I tried it, the Heralds said to me,  

            "In a decision rendered by the College of Arms on
             August 1st, A.S. V it was decided that this style of
             heraldic design was not appropriate to the aims and 
             intentions of the Corporate Body. Holy! Holy! Holy! "

 note: verse 5 is delivered in an extremely fast, mono-
       tone, similiar to a Gregorian Chant.

           " ....we haven't got it, we upped the fees, we changed the forms,
             and it violates the Rule of Three."

6.           I tried it a sixth time, and the Heralds said to me,

            "We changed the rules, &c"

7.           A seventh time I tried and, the Heralds said to me,

            "It's against the Rule of Tincture, we changed the
             rules, &c"

8.           I tried it once again and the heralds said to me,

            "It's not a Period design, It's against the Rule of Tincture, We
             changed the rules, &c"

                                * more *



    Heralds Said To Me (cont.)

9.           I sent it in once more, and the Heralds said to me,

            "We changed the rules again, It's not a Period design,
             it's against the Rule of Tincture, we changed the
             rules, &c"

10. (sung in cold anger)
             The LAST time I sent my device, the Heralds said to me

    (sung in a state of SMUG)
             "Someone else has got it, &c"




              (nb: every single one of these reasons has been used by the
              CoA, at one point or another, to reject perfectly good
              heraldry, along with some even MORE stupid.  If the shoe 
              fits....................!!!!!!!!)

           or: Who was that Vermin I saw you with last, Knight?
   or: There may be Lice on all you Knice, but there ain't no Lice on me

           Once there was a Barony howling in the wilderness
           nestled in the Valley where the River doesn't flow
           and the folks were driven buggy by the insects in the Revel Hall
           Authenticity is wonderful, but this doesn't go!

                   Bugs on the Baroness, bugs on the Baroness!
                   That was the cry that you heard all the day
                   and the scratching can be heard from Ysgithr to Ered Sul
                   why did we come here? Let's go away!

           See them all a scratching, nestled in their armour tight
           the fleas have a melee team that's challenging the field!
           call Truly Nolen! Someone's gotta help us out!
           the crabs are nesting in our helms but we'll never yield!

                   (chorus)

           Dawn comes a-breaking, the bugs have won the Coronet...
           flea-infested Conan-clones in piles upon the lawn
           where is the Barony? The bugs have eaten everyone...
           termites got the stick-jocks, and all their sticks are gone!

                   (chorus)

                  For all the Lands where I have dwelt
                  Oh Atenveldt, Oh Atenveldt
                  till rivers burn and mountains melt
                  lest I forget my Atenveldt
                  From deserts stark to snow-capped peaks
                  from silent lakes and laughing creeks
                  sing: Oh let man find his heart's ease
                  on rocky plains
                  in desert breeze

                  For oft I thought of mighty men
                  who carved a Land with sword and pen
                  and lit a candle, burning bright,
                  that pierced the darkness; stirred the night!
                  tho some are gone their deeds remain
                  this sunny Crown without a stain
                  sing: Oh, their deeds were not in vain!
                  in sunlit days
                  and falling rain.....

                  So raise your banners, blazoned bright
                  Advance the Dream and Shine the Light!
                  in battle's crash and Revel's song
                  raise high the Flag and wave it long!
                  For all the Lands wherein I've dwelt
                  I love you best, my Atenveldt!
                  Sing: Oh the Joy that I have felt!

      What the use of wearing panties
      whalebone corsets of your Auntie's
      boxer shorts and other scanties
      best of all is nude
      there's such fun in going bra-less
      now that it's no longer lawless
      'specially if your figure's flawless
      best of all is nude
      nude is what you're born in
      shirts are never torn in
      underwear and lacy flimsies, garter belts and other whimsies
      yards of itchy cloth to put your form in
      ducks all do it, maidens rue it
      even ancient Picts in Britain blue it
      going naked's how to do it
      best of all is nude!

      If your garters aren't elastic
      tie them up in knots fantastic
      (panty hose is something drastic!)
      best of all is nude!
      If you're tired of wearing clotheses
      shed your garment 'mongst the roses
      never mind the old bluenoses
      best of all is nude!
      Nude is best for ducking!
      Worst for horses bucking!
      Moonlit nights will see such sights
          that are very best for fooling round
                              .....and elbows!
      Nudity is grand to see
       a well-known antidote to virginity
      take your clothes off and you'll see:
      best of all is nude!

                   Hi said the Norn, sittin in the sand
                   once I talked to a great Grey Man
                   spun three times and said with a sigh
                   hadn't been for the Runes had his other eye!

                   Chorus: hi diddle i diddle i day

                   Hi said the Lady, dressed in green
                   prettiest thing I've ever seen
                   she went down underneath the hill
                   and came back out of her own free will

                   Brian Boru, on Irish ground
                   walked three times the Island round
                   Norsemen came lookin for a fight
                   just another Irish Saturday night!

                   Hi said Lugh on the banquest night
                   a poet and a player and a good wheelwright
                   a harper and a warrior and none the least:
                   a Druid and he got in to the Feast!

                   Harold Haardrada's face was red!
                   Came to Britain and he wound up dead
                   Stamford Bridge is where he's found
                   got six feet of English ground

                   the Legion with it's Eagles bright
                   marched into the Pictish night
                   met them there upon the sand
                   gave em up to the Wicker Man!

                   eight-legged steed and hound of Hel
                   the one-eyed Man, he loves ya well
                   fire burn and fire spark
                   are you then feared of the dark?

                   The Circle forms, the Circle flows
                   the Circle goes where no man knows
                   Hail to the Lady, one in three:
                   Present is Past and Past is Me!

                   Rhiannon's Birds are still in flight
                   all thru the Day all thru the Night
                   Hail to the Lady, one in Three
                   Present is Past and Past is Thee!

                   Hi said the Lady dressed in white
                   sang the Day and sang the Night
                   sang the Land and sang the Sea
                   sang the Song, and then sang Me!

                                  From the misty crystal sea
                                  came the Lady to the lea
                                  Sword and Roses in Her Hand
                                  spread their seeds thruout the Land

                                  Came the Stag from oaken wood
                                  saw the Lady where she stood
                                  by the fire burning bright
                                  came to know his heart's delight!

                   Present is Past and Past is WE

                   By Oak and Ash and Holy Thorn
                   bledded be the Day you're born!

                    WEAPONS AT THE DOOR

 Being a Polemic concerning the alleged Custom of the West Kingdom concerning 
 checking your Weapons at the Door of the Revel Hall. As the Satire is the 
 Weapon of the Bard, this said Polemic is to be checked at the Door, along with 
 swords, knives, redheaded Ladies and other such Deadly Things.....

         As I roved out to Western Lands to take the Western Air
         I went into a Revel Hall and I saw a Twelfth Night there
         but I was halted at the gate by a Privy Consellor
                 (that's the man who tells the King of the West how to go to
                  the bath room!)
         who told me I would have to check my Weapons at the door

         As I, in my astonishment, stood hung on tenter-pegs
         a Knight came in whose Prouess hung down between his legs
         the Doorman grabbed a greatsword and he struck the Knight full sore
         and gave him a reciept; he left his weapon at the door!

         a Bard was next whose goodly Voice has entertained us all
         but he, too, was prevented from entering the Hall
         and told he could not carry deadly weapons on the floor
         he left his Voice and Harp among the weapons at the door

         a Master entered graciously, a man we all know well
         who holds a 3rd Dan Black Belt, tho this he'd never tell
         the Master struggled valiantly, the Master cursed and swore
         but he left his hands, and feet, as weapons at the door

         the company was jovial, altho a bit dismayed
         for lack of proper cutlery, down to the smallest blade
         for even teeth and fingernails, each can be used in War
         were cut, and pulled, and left behind, as weapons at the door!

         And has their King not loyal Knights that He must be afraid
         of brawling in his Hall and of Assassin's bloody blade?
         the Rights of Men to carry Arms at least WE'VE not foreswore
         and a POX on them that made the Rule of Weapons at the Door!

                           THE STREETS OF ANN ARBOR

               As I walked out thru the streets of Ann Arbor
               as I walked out thru Ann Arbor one day
               I spied a young Mongol all dressed in white linen
               all dressed in white linen and cold as the clay

               I then spied another, done in on the sidewalk
               along with just about six dozen more
               their wounds were all gaping, from mace and from braoadsword
               from claymore and cannon, all dripping with gore

               what caused this grave carnage, I cried to the Monglos
               oh pray what's the reason for this awful sight
               my answer came slowly from under the corpse-pile
               "It seems that our bark is much worse than our bite....."

               the answer continued from pale lips a-shaking
               we sang all our songs and believed them as true
               the Dark Horde could never be beaten in battle
               we thought this was what all good Mongols could do...

               we went down to Atenveldt all for to plunder
               "too large to defend" was our song every night
               but Atenveldt's different from East, West or Middle
               there, even the bushes have learned how to bite!

               the Clann stole our ponies, the Scraelings our foodstuffs
               we ran into axes in AtenViking hands
               our maidens ran off with one Richard of Arkham
               and we're all that's left to return to our lands

               MacChluarains and Monsters, Lockehaven and Foxmoor
               that Kingdom is BIG and its' fighters are MEAN!
               we fought and we lost, and fled back to Ann Arbor
               we all came back home with results that you've seen

               keep away from that Land with its' cactus and marshes
               it's no place for Mongols who are bent on War
               they count their blows well, but they strick them yet better
               he crawled into his Yurt, and fell, dead, on the floor.....

                       SONG OF THE THREE
             copyright 1981 W. J. Bethancourt III
                            C. A. Bethancourt III
       tune: the song of the Cowardly Lion, Tin Woodsman and Scarecrow
             in the movie version of the Wizard of Oz

        (Enter the Scarecrow, who singeth:)

        My wife is always nagging; my Prowess it is lagging
        I can't do anything
        she has got a reason, but revenge is out of season
        Oh I wish I could be King!

        If I just had the Crown on, I'd always have a frown on
        and the Barons on a string
        Heads they would be rolling, the Board would be cajoling
        Oh if only I was King!

        I am very fed up with the way this group is set up
        Oh I'd change everything!
        they are so high and mighty with the way that they do fight-ey
        Oh, someday I'll be King!

        Tho my wife is melancholic, and very...vitriolic
        she's a wasp without a sting!
        I'd have to supervise her with a pack of tranquilizers
        If I only was a King......

        (the Tin Woodsman joineth him, and singeth:)

        I grew up kind of cocky, and rather big, and stocky
        and straight as any rod
        on the field I'm a battallion, with the Ladies I'm a stallion
        ...Oh they'd better make me God!

        The other boys are jealous they say I'm over-zealous
        they'd do better to applaud
        the things that I am giving to this Dream that we are living
        oh I wish they'd make me God!

        They say that I'm conceited, but I'm just badly treated
        by people and by BoD
        just think of what they're missing by My Majesty dismissing
        Oh they'd better make me God!

        (the Cowardly Lion creepeth forth, and singeth:)

        Oh I could be a fighter, a great and mighty smiter
        and be the perfect knight
        it's a great and nasty shame, and everyone's to blame
        oh I wish that I could fight!

        Song of the Three (cont.)

        I could be a Cavalier drinking wine and ale and beer
        and be a gorgeous sight
        but it would cost me too much money so it isn't very funny
        oh I wish that I could fight!                               

        Let me at 'em on the field, I would surely make them yield
        to my Power and my Might
        with rattan, shinai and rapier they would nevermore escape here
        If they'd only let me fight

        (all doeth the Softe Shoe off, stage left)

                She was afraid to come out to the Tourney
                She was worried that "something might show.."
                She was afraid to come out to the Tourney
                And the poor thing did NOT want to go...

                  (2 - 3 - 4, tell the people what she wore!)

                One day in the Kingdom of the Middle
                It happened at a Tourney one day:
                The Mongols invaded the Middle
                But the Middle did not want to play...

                  (eins - zwei - drei, but the Dark Horde wouldn't die!)

                  It was an itsy bitsy tiny teenie Nauseating Mongol weenie

          Some folks call me many names, others call me crazy
          Tom O'Bedlam's son am I, for my mind is hazy!
          I'd rather sing a song than work (if it's not too phrasey!)
          Lengthy rhymes don't bother me....truth to tell: I'm lazy!

          Yang, your yurt is very nice, and your Horde is smelly,
          And I'm sure that yak-meat will nicely fill one's belly!
          But remember this one line, or you're not worth jelly:
          FIRST you plunder, THEN you burn! That's how to be rakehelly!

          My Lady Lorelei your eyes do drive me to distraction
          And the lovely Care-Cheri causes....petrifaction!
          But I, and they, quite taken are, so I can't take action...
          Therefore, Ladies, fill my cup; I'll drink to stupefaction!

          Now Atenveldt your fighters, all, are most good and gentle
          And the Ladies, bless 'em all, are most ornamental!
          But that little Nikki-Toad....has me sentimental
          Though with boffer in her hand she is argumental!

          This stupid little song, m'lords, is mostly sung in Latin
          By the Goliards, of course, from vespers clear to matins!
          But I prefer a coarser cloth over silk or satins
          English is more understood, mine enemies to flatten!

          Good People all, I've made my Song, its' music's well-recited
          But my voice could use some work; the flowers it has blighted!
          It's rude and rusty, grim and bad, and squeaky like a door-hinge,
          But I'm a better Bard than you: I found a rhyme for "orange!"

 resident in Caid. This verse was written when she was 2 years old. Ask HER!

                      by William Poundstone
                              1983

     Two mentalities are at work here: 1960s rock fans and 1980s
fundamentalist Christians. The idea of phonographically concealed
messages dates from the Paul McCartney death scare of 1969. For
hard-core types, the secret-message rumors never really died. Avid
rock fans have auditioned ever album release since the late 1960s
for hidden nuances. Backward messages, barely audible messages,
and messages on one stereo track only have been alleged. At the
other end of the sociosensual spectrum, fundamentalist Christians
have gotten into the act. TV programs such as PRAISE THE LORD and
THE 700 CLUB have propagated rumors of a satanic plot in the
recording industry, no less, in which various albums conceal
"backward-masked" demonic murmurings. If THAT sounds too spacey to
be taken seriously, consider that it was the fundamentalist groups
who were behind House Resolution 6363, a bill introduced in the
U.S. House of Representatives by Robert K. Dornan (R., Calif.) in
1982 to label all suspect records: "WARNING: THIS RECORD CONTAINS
BACKWARD MASKING THAT MAKES A VERBAL STATEMENT WHICH IS AUDIBLE
WHEN THIS RECORD IS PLAYED BACKWARD AND WHICH MAY BE PERCEPTIBLE
AT A SUBLIMINAL LEVEL WHEN THIS RECORD IS PLAYED FORWARD." In
February 1983, the Arkansas State Senate passed a similar record-
labeling bill by a vote of 86 to 0.
     Contributing to the quasi-occult status of these rumors is
the difficulty of checking them out on home audio equipment. You
pretty much have to take someone else's word for it, or dismiss
the rumors out of hand.
     From a technical standpoint, there are four simple ways to
conceal a verbal message on a recording. The most obvious is to
record the message at a very low volume. The message may then be
recovered by turning the volume up while playing the record or
tape. If the message is faint enough, though, noise levels of home
equipment may garble it. If the accompanying music or lyrics are
loud enough, or if the message itself is indistinct or
electronically modified, it may be hard to hear on any equipment.
     A second gimmick is to record a message on one stereo track
only. Records and tapes have two independent recordings, of
course, normally played simultaneously for stereo effect. On a
record, each stereo track occupies on one side of the V-shaped
groove for the needle. On a tape, the tracks are recorded in
parallel lanes of the magnetic material. The two tracks are called
"right" and "left" after the stereo speakers they will play on.
Otherwise, the tracks are interchangeable -- the sound mixer can
put anything he or she wants on each track. A message on one track
can be masked by simultaneous loud music or lyrics on the opposite
track. With normal stereo balance (or mono equipment) the loud
track drowns out the message track. At home, single-track messages
can be recovered by adjusting the stereo balance so that only the
desired track plays. Sometimes this trick also makes indistinct
words clearer. Even if the words are not exclusively on one track,
they may happen to be more audible on one track.
     A message could be recorded at a speed different from the
rest of the record. Then the record would have to be played faster
or slower than usual to recover the message. Unless the message
was at one of the standard speeds (say, 45 rpm on a 33 1/3 rpm
record), it could not be played normally on home equipment.
     The fourth and most commonly alleged trick is to record a
verbal message backward. Reversed speech has several unexpected
features. One is that syllables are not a constant in the reversal
process. A one-syllable word can have two or three syllables when
played backward. Thus "number nine" in the Beatles' REVOLUTION 9
reverses to "Turn me on, dead man" (or something like it), a jump
from three to five syllables.
     There is no simple way to predict what a word or phrase will
sound like reversed. Obviously, you can't just reverse the
letters.
     Reversed messages are difficult to recover at home. Record
turntables are not built to go backwards. Some have a neutral
setting, in which the pickup and amplifier remain active and you
can turn the record backward by hand. But hardly anyone has a
stead enough hand to produce satisfactory results.
     With patience, it is possible to reverse a cassette
recording. Transfer the music from the original record or tape
onto a blank tape cassette. Place the cassette flat on a table.
Draw our the part of the tape with the suspected message and snip
it off at both ends. Hold the tape segment horizontally. Rotate it
180 degrees, keep it horizontal at all times. This turns the tape
end for end. Splice the reversed tape segment back onto the two
loose ends of the cassette with strong adhesive tape. Reel the
tape back inside the cassette. The sliced segment will play
backward on an ordinary cassette player.
     I rented a recording studio to test the secret-message
rumors. New copiies of the records in question were transcribed on
a quarter-inch master tape. Where rumor alleged that a single
stereo track contained a message, right and left stereo tracks
were transcribed separately. Records with alleged inaudible
messages were treated similarly. To test claims of reversed
messages, recordings on the master tape were edited out and
spliced in backward. Twenty cuts or portions of cuts from sixteen
albums were tested.


"Another One Bites the Dust"
Queen, THE GAME

Rumor: When played backward, the lyrics say, "It's fun to smoke
marijuana."
Findings: There is something that sounds like "It's fun to smoke
marijuana" in the reversed music. It is repeated over and over. It
might be rendered no less faithfully, however, as "sfun to scout
mare wanna." This "message" is the reversal of the song title,
which is repeated as a line in the song.
     Let's make a distinction between engineered and phonetic
reversals. When an artist records a verbal statement, reverses it
by turning the tape end for end, mixes the reversed statement onto
a master tape, and has records and tapes produced from the master,
that is an engineered reversal. When the phonetic properties of
song lyrics are such that they can be reversed to sound like
something else, that is a phonetic reversal.
     "It's fun to smoke marijuna" is clearly a phonetic reversal.
The lyrics are perfectly plain played forward ("Another one bites
the dust"), no so plain played backward ("sfun to scout mare
wanna"). With an engineered reversal, the opposite should hold
true: gibberish forward, clear as a bell backward. Some are
prepared to believe that phonetic reversals are just as
intentional as engineered reversals -- that the songwriter
painstakinginly planned the phonetic double-entendre. In the
absence of confirming evidence, that just doesn't wash. It's too
easy to find coincidences. If, for example, the letters of the
alphabet are recited in conventional fashion (Ay, Bee, Cee, etc.)
and reversed, at least five sound like English language words. D
reverses to "eden," F becomes "pray," S becomes "say," V becomes
"even," and Z becomes "easy." "It's fun to smoke marijuana" is
likewise a coincidence.


"A Child is Coming"
Jefferson Starship, BLOWS AGAINST THE EMPIRE

Rumor: When played backward, "son of Satan."
Findings: Another phonetic coincidence. The repeated "It's getting
better" reverses to an iffy "son of Satan," the "of" drawn out and
the "Satan" strongly accented on the first syllable.


"Eldorado"
Electric Light Orchestra, ELDORADO

Rumor: When played backward, "He is the nasty one/ Christ, you're
infernal/ It is said we're dead men/ Everyone who has the mark
will live."
Findings: Coincidence. The supposed message lurks around the line
"On a voyage of no return to see." Reversed, this passage becomes
the expected syllable salad -- no one hearing it would describe it
as anything but reversed music. Only if you listen while reading
along with what you're supposed to hear will you get anything. The
rumored version of the message is somewhat fudged. The passage
sounds more like "He's to nasty one/ Christ you are, Christ,
you're fernal/ There wiss uh, we're dead men..." There is no "in"
in what is taken to be "infernal." The line that is supposed to be
"Everyone who has the mark will live" isn't even close, though the
syllable count is right.


"Shoo Be Doo"
The Cars, CANDY-O

Rumor: When played backward, the word "Satan" repeated
approximately eleven times.
Findings: Coincidence. The rumor refers to the reversal of the "Shoo
be doo, shoo be doo, shoo be doo..." near the end of the song. Given
the mysterious logic of reversed phonemes, these three-syllable units
can be hard as a repeated two-syllable word. The word sounds a little
like "Satan."


"Snowblind"
Styx, PARADISE THEATER

Rumor: According to a mimeographed list of suspect records distributed
by Congressman Dornan, the words "Satan move through our voices" when
played backwards.
Findings: Negative. Despite repeated listenings, it was not even
possible to identify the part of the reversed track that Dornan et al.
are talking about.


"Stairway to Heaven"
Led Zeppelin, untitled, a.k.a. STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN

Rumor: In reverse, "I live for Satan... The Lord turns me off...
There's no escaping it... Here's to my sweet Satan... There's power in
Satan... He will give you 666."
Findings: Coincidence. If you listen very carefully to the "And it
makes me wonder" lines in reverse, you'll hear something approaching
"There's no escaping it." A better description is "There's no escape
do." Knock of the last syllable, and you have "There's no escape," a
complete, intelligible sentence in reverse. It's there, all right, but
it's not an unlikely enough coincidence to -- well, make you wonder.
      The "Satan" in "I live for Satan" is good and clear. The "I live
for" part isn't. The other alleged lines are unremarkable. All are
phonetic reversals of the entirely lucid forward lyrics and obviously
just accidents.


"When Electricity Came to Arkansas"
Black Oak Arkansas, BLACK OAK ARKANSAS and RONCH AND ROLL

Rumor: In reverse, "Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan. He is God. He
is God."
Findings: The BLACK OAK ARKANSAS cut was reversed. Again, pairs of
reversed syllables are being freely interpreted as "Satan." "He is
God" was not identifiable.


"Rain"
The Beatles, HEY JUDE

Rumor: Unintelligible lyrics at the end are reversed.
Findings: A true engineered reversal and not really a secret. "Rain"
seems to have been the first popular recording to incorporate an
obviously reversed lyric. The story is that John Lennon accidentally
spliced the last part of the song in backward and liked the effect.
When reversed, the strange-sounding vocals at the end become
intelligible as a reprise starting with the drawn-out word
"sunshine."
      The reversal is less apparent to the casual listener than it
might be because the accompanying music is not reversed. The ending
fits in smoothly with the rest of the song, the vocals suggesting a
foreign language.


"Fire on High"
Electric Light Orchestra, FACE THE MUSIC

Rumor: When played backward, "The music is reversible, but time --
turn back!"
Findings: "Fire on High" is instrumental. About twenty-six seconds
into the music, scrambled speech is heard. It is mostly louder than
the accompanying music and begins with a two-syllable unit repeated
several times. The seeming speech lasts for about fourteen seconds.
      Reversing the music confirms that there is a true, engineered
message. In reverse, a voice (Jeff Lynne's?) says, "The music is
reversible, but time -- turn back! Turn back! Turn back! Turn back!"
All the words are clear and unambiguous. Anyone comparing this to the
alleged reversal on ELO's "Eldorado" will have no trouble telling
which is genuine.


"Goodbye Blue Sky"
Pink Floyd, THE WALL

Rumor: In reverse, "You have discovered the secret message."
Findings: The "secret message" is at the very end of the instrumental
passage following the "Goodbye Blue Sky" vocals. It comes just before
the words "What shall we do" at the start of the song that is
identified as "Empty Spaces" on the record label and as "What shall we
do now?" on the record sleeve. Played forward, the message is less
apparent than the FACE THE MUSIC reversal: A reasonably attentive
listener might play THE WALL through and not catch it. It suggests
speech not quite close enough to be overheard. In context this is not
unusual because the "Goodbye Blue Sky" instrumental passage includes
"airport noises" and other sound effects. A loud climax in the music
further masks the unintelligible voice.
      When played backward, the voice (Roger Waters?) plainly intones,
"Congratulations, you have just discovered the secret message. Please
send your answer to old Pink, care of the funny farm..." As the voice
fades out, there may be another word -- perhaps "Chalfonte or
"Chelsea" -- after "funny farm."


"Heavy Metal Poisoning"
Styx, KILROY WAS HERE

Rumor: A red sticker on the KILROY WAS HERE cover warns, "By order of
the Majority for Musical Morality, this album contains secret backward
messages..."
Findings: This is a case of second-generation backward-masking. Styx'
PARADISE THEATER did not contain a backward message, though a lot of
people said it did. So Styx has included a sure enough backward
message on KILROY WAS HERE. It is at the very beginning of "Heavy
Metal Poisoning." The reversed speech last about three seconds. There
is no musical background. The words reverse to "Annuit coeptis. Novus
ordo seclorum." This is the Latin motto encircling the pyramid on the
back of a dollar bill. The usual translation: "God has favored our
undertakings. A new order of the ages."
      The cover sticker's "Majority for Musical Morality" is a
fictitious Falwellesque group in the KILROY WAS HERE video. Although
the sticker suggests a plurality of "messages," only one was found.


Space between "I'm So Tired" and "Blackbird"
The Beatles, untitled, a.k.a. THE WHITE ALBUM

Rumor: A reversed message. At the time of the Paul-is-dead stories,
the segue from "I'm So Tired" to "Blackbird" was offered as evidence.
It was held to contain John Lennon's voice, reveresed, saying "Paul is
dead, miss him, miss him, miss him." That interpretation seems
unlikely now, but there is a mysterious low muttering between the
songs.
Findings: The mumbling is actually just to the "I'm So Tired" side of
the shiny "space" between cuts on the record. Each of the stereo
tracks was recorded separately, twice, and a copy of each track was
reversed. This produced four versions of the two-second passage: right
forward, left forward, right reversed, and left reversed. All were
equally unintelligible. It was not even apparent whether the voice is
forward or reversed. Nor could John Lennon be identified as the
speaker. There are nine or ten syllables. The first six (when played
forward) are a two-syllable unit repeated three times. There is little
or no difference betwen the stereo tracks. Any claimed interpretation
of the sounds seems doubtful.


"Strawberry Fields Forever"
The Beatles, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR

Rumor: It was, of course, claimed that John Lennon says "I buried
Paul" at the end. (It's forward, at the very end after the music
fades to complete silence, returns, and starts to fade out again.)
But Lennon told ROLLING STONE that the words are "cranberry
sauce."
Findings: They are "cranberry sauce." The "sauce"/"Paul" part is
indistinct, but the first syllable sounds a lot more like "cran"
than "I."


"Baby You're a Rich Man"
The Beatles, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR

Rumor: On one of the tracks the line "Baby you're a rich man too"
is sung as "Baby you're a rich fag Jew," a dig at Brian Epstein.
Or some think it's "rich fat Jew" and claim it as evidence of
Beatle anti-Semitism.
Findings: Negative. The two stereo tracks are nearly identical.
It's always possible to hear words as similar-sounding words, but
basically, the lyrics jibe with the published version.


"Revolution 9"
The Beatles, untitled, a.k.a. THE WHITE ALBUM

Rumor: Various reversed and/or one-track speech. The reversal of
"Number nine" to "Turn me on, dead man" has pretty much been
discounted as coincidence (though it appears on Congressman
Dornan's list).
Findings: Distinction between lyrics and any hidden message blurs
on "Revolution 9." The eight-minute cut is a montage of sounds
collected by John Lennon and Yoko Ono. It includes discordant
music, radio broadcasts, sirens, applause, gunfights, sports
cheers, the crackling of a fire, screams, a baby gurgling, a choir
singing, and much that cannot be identified. For this
investigation, "Revolution 9" was transcribed four times, twice on
each stereo channel. One copy of each of the tracks was reversed.
The four resulting versions were compared with each other and
against the original two-channel version.
     "Revolution 9" contains a lot of talking. Played in stereo,
forward, the longest stretch of understandable speech is probably
an announcer saying, "...every one of them knew that as time went
by they'd get a little bit older and a little bit slower..."
     One believable instance of reversed speech occurs: someone
saying "Let me out! Let me out!" (once held to represent McCartney
in his totaled Aston-Martin). Two iffy reversals occur on the
backward recording of the right stereo track:"She used to be
assistant" and "There were two men..." Neither is clear enough or
long enough to be convincing. Some of the music, including the
recurring theme, sounds more natural in reverse.
     "Turn me on, dead man" is a typical phonetic reversal. The
forward "number nine" (repeated throughout the cut) is clear; the
reversal is slurred -- something like "turn me on dedmun." It has
been claimed that "number nine" must be pronounced with a British
accent or with some careful inflection in order to reverse to
"Turn me on, dead man." This seems not to be so. As an experiment,
three American-accent renderings of "number nine" were reversed.
All sound about as much like "Turn me on, dead man" as the record
did. Like the other phonetic reversals, "Turn me on, dead man"
must be considered a coincidence.
     Much of "Revolution 9" is on one stereo track only. Near the
end a voice says "A fine natural imbalance...the Watusi...the
twist...Eldorado...Eldorado." "A fine natural imbalance" is on the
right track only, though the words that follow are in stereo. One
of the longer bits of speech -- "Who could tell what he was
saying? His voice was low and his [unintelligible] was high and
his eyes were low" -- is clear on the left track, a bare whisper
on the right.
     There is a stereophonically concealed "secret message" on
"Revolution 9." The words are on the right track. They begin about
four minutes, fifty-eight seconds into the cut and run for about
twenty-two seconds. They are not likely to be noticed in stereo
because of the much louder left track. The sound of applause
begins on the left track at about five minutes, one second into
the cut. Deafening noises -- the clapping, sirens, music --
continue on the left track until five minutes, forty seconds. It
may or may not have been Lennon's and Ono's intention to conceal
the spoken passage. Given the haphazard quality of "Revolution 9,"
the concealment may have been accidental. To recover the passage,
the left track must be switched off. The right track can then be
heard to contain a sound like a stopwatch ticking, behind these
words:

     So the wife called, and we better go to see a
     surgeon....[A SCREAM MUFFLES A LINE THAT SOUNDS LIKE
     Well, what with the prices, the prices have snowballed,
     no wonder it's closed.] ...So any and all, we went to
     see the dentist instead, who gave him a pair of teeth,
     which wasn't any good at all. So instead of that he
     joined the bloody navy and went to sea.
                      by William Poundstone
                              1986

     There really are backward messages on rock albums. And the
controversy over "backward masking" and "porn rock" has inspired a
whole new spate of messages. There may have been more genuine
backward messages in the past few years than ever before.
     The backward message controversy is usually traced to the
1960s and John Lennon's avant-garde sound mixing on such tracks as
"Revolution 9" on the Beatles' WHITE ALBUM. Lennon probably wasn't
trying to conceal a message so much as create an interesting
sound.
     The matter might have ended right there had it not been for
the Paul McCartney death rumor. College kids tried playing Beatles
records forward, backward, and at various speeds to find "clues"
to McCartney's fate. In the process they found snippets of speech
from Lennon's experiments. Even after McCartney was found safe and
sound in Scotland, some listeners continued to look for hidden
messages.
     Somehow, fundamentalist Christian groups became convinced
(ca. 1982) that the alleged messages were commercials for devil
worship. Not a single indisputable satanic message has turned up,
but there were scattered attempts to ban or label certain albums.
In 1986 one fundamentalist group announced that the theme song for
the old MR. ED TV show contains the word "Satan" when played
backward.)
     Ironically, the publicity accorded nonexistent messages has
inspired several artists -- among them porn rock hearing witness
Frank Zappa -- to hide real background messages in their music.
It's easy to do.
     The performer speaks or sings the message normally, then
reverses the tape, which is mixed into the soundtrack. This is all
accomplished simply enough at any recording studio.
     What's not so simple is playing it back. More home record,
cassette, and compact disk players won't play backward. You can
turn a record backward with a pencil eraser, but it's not good for
the needle or the turntable. The only way to reproduce the message
with full fidelity is to use a professional-quality reel-to-reel
tape player and splice the tape in backward.
     We used the facilities of KLOS radio in Los Angeles to
reverse some recent records containing true backward messages.


"Secret Messages"
Electric Light Orchestra, SECRET MESSAGES

ELO's ELDORADO album was among those alleged to contain satanic
backward masked messages. A patient listening to ELDORADO played
backward reveals no such messages. You hear only what you ought to
hear -- the reversed lyrics of the songs, which sound nothing like
the "messages" claimed to be there. In the wake of such
allegations, ELO did put an (innocuous) backward message on their
FACE THE MUSIC album. Perhaps they thought this would show how
silly the allegations were. Instead, the backward-masking people
seized on this as proof that the other "messages" were real. In
the latest volley, ELO has named an album after the controversy.
     In Britain (where the backward-masking issue is viewed as an
American eccentricity), the cover of SECRET MESSAGES has a mock
warning label to youth about the hidden label. Word of the albums'
impending release in the United States caused enough of a furor to
chill CBS Records into deleting the cover blurb.
     The reversed message is easy to find. It's at the beginning
of the first song, which is itself called "Secret Messages." You
can hear reversed speech when you play the record normally. A
voice intones "secret messages" -- forward -- in the middle of the
reversed speech, lest anyone dare be so unhip as to not know
what's going on.
     We transferred a new copy of SECRET MESSAGES to reel-to-reel
tapes and played it backward. The backward message goes: "WELCOME
TO THE BIG SHOW/ WELCOME TO THE BIG SHOW."
     That's it.


"Ya Hozna"
Frank Zappa, THEM OR US

"Ya Hozna," a six-minute composition on the first record of the
THEM OR US double album, is ENTIRELY backward. The albums' inner
cover, which includes lyrics for the other songs, says, "backwards
vocal -- you figure it out" of this cut. It credits Frank and Moon
Zappa, George Duke, and Napoleon Murphy Brock as vocalists.
     Played forward, "Ya Howza" sounds like a record played
backward -- reasonably so. The vocals are prominent and
unintelligible. Moon Zappa's voice is curiously recognizable, even
in reverse. It is hard to tell whether the music was recorded
forward or backward.
     When "Ya Howza" is played in reverse, you discover that the
music is virtually a palindrome -- it sounds about the same
forward and backward. The voices are all backward. In some cases
they have been modified electronically. Many of the words are
muffled. Even after repeated careful listening on both stereo
tracks, it is difficult to make out many of the lyrics. It doesn't
help that some of the words seem to be stream-of-consciousness
nonsense. Some of the unintelligible stuff sounds like opera.
     Starting at the beginning of the reversed tape -- the end of
the forward tape -- the clearer vocals go like this: "I am the
heaven, I am the water." This is in a hymnlike register. "You are
a lonely little girl./ But your mommy and your daddy hold you." A
singsong synthesizer voice.
     The most interesting part of the lyrics is an intermittently
orgasmic rap in Moon Zappa's Valley Girl voice. There are three
short monologues:

I'm like green!
I'm like squat!
I'm like soul!
Repeat, like soul!
I'm like pull, push,
Okay, like slow, slow.

You're never too old
Like slow, like slow, like slow
Okay, I like it.


All right, faster, faster,
Go, do it, do it twice,
Yeah, that feels good,
I'm looking great,
Yeah, fer shure!
Like, no way!


"No Anchovies, Please"
J. Geils Band, LOVE STINKS

"No Anchovies, Please" is a novelty song, really a narration with
sound effects, about a woman who is kidnapped after eating
anchovies. She is taken to a "foreign-speaking" country. The sound
effect of the foreign tongue seems reversed. When you do play it
in reverse, it becomes: "It doesn't take a genius to know the
difference between chicken shit and chicken salad."


"Darling Nikki"
Prince, PURPLE RAIN

"Darling Nikki," cited as porn rock before Congress, is about a
dominatrix in a hotel lobby masturbating with a magazine. In part,
the complaint was that the album cover (flowers, and Prince on a
motorcycle) wasn't explicit enough to warn kids of the suggestive
lyrics. Senator Paula Hawkins apparently was not aware of a
backward message hidden in "Darling Nikki." The last thirty-five
seconds of the song is gibberish. The music changes abruptly and
becomes a repeated glottal sound. Then a two-syllable sound is
repeated twice, something like "heaven, heaven." Unintelligible
speech follows. At the end is a sound reminiscent of rain or bacon
frying , and wind sounds.
     Played backward, the message becomes:

     Hello, how are you?
     I'm fine 'cause I know that the Lord is coming soon.
     Coming, coming soon.

     It is clearly Prince and the Revolution singing this. The
words are clear but the intonation is funny -- the linger on some
words. Perhaps this is to make the reversed message you hear
playing the record normally a little less conspicuous.
     This is a weird reversal of the supposed secret message
menace. Raunchy forward lyrics conceal a religious secret message.


"Judas Kiss"
Petra, MORE POWER TO YOU

Petra is an obscure group that sings religious songs to a rock
beat. As further proof that things have gone full circle, the
backward-masking controversy prompted Petra to include a wholesome
backward message on their MORE POWER TO YOU album. It is in the
transition between two songs, just before "Judas Kiss." Clearly
audible gibberish reverses to this (the husky voice a cross
between George Beverly Shea and Dee Snider): "What are you looking
for the Devil for, when you ought to be looking for the Lord?"

AFL JoyceM Welcome to the Apple II Music & Sound chat - our discussion will
           be on NoiseTracker - the new FTA music program for the GS.  AFA
           Gene will be our host this evening...Gene, the floor is yours :)

AFA Gene   Hi all... well first I'd like to point out, if y'all aren't aware
           yet, that a spanking new version of NoiseTracker has recently
           been released (9 days ago) and is now available in our New Files
           library. It is version 0.5. I haven't played around with it much
           yet, but it's supposed to fix a lot of the little bugs in 0.3
           (the first version we had online).  NoiseTracker also includes
           the ability to directly import "modules," a term used for a
           certain type of Amiga song file which has become popular among PC
           users using the SoundBlaster sound card.

           Now, via NT, these "MOD" files are accessible by the GS. We
           expect to see a lot of activity on this end as far as ports from
           the PC and Amiga go. Note that you should be able to go straight
           to the PC music forum and download any recently uploaded MOD
           songfiles (there was a bug in the first wide release of the PCAO
           software, however, so a bunch of files with dates between around
           March 1991 and September 1991 may not download properly. Note that
           to use these PC MOD files, you'll have to rename the downloaded
           file "MOD.xxxxxx" if you want it to show up automatically in NT's
           "open" dialog box. (On the PC, all MOD files are named
           "xxxxxxxx.MOD" instead.)   Also, if the files are packed with ZIP
           compression, you'll need a program from the Communications Forum
           called AGATE -- it's a terminal program that includes the ability
           to unpack ZIP files.

           Now, I guess the best thing to do would be to talk about our
           favorite songfiles... there have been a few complaints, in fact,
           that people were not being "descriptive" enough in their file
           descriptions for uploads in describing the songs.

AFC Eddie  ?

AFA Gene   GA ed

AFC Eddie  Once a MOD file is unpacked with Agate, is a file type change
           needed?

AFA Gene   Nope, since all that NT looks for is the "MOD." being the first
           four characters in the filename.

AFC Eddie  OK, Thanks!

Deanna7332 Question...

JonL7      Can you list some of the features of Noisetracker?

AFA Gene   (you don't even need that "MOD." if you want to type the name in
           directly.)

Deanna7332 Did any of these mod files have anything to do with FTA's "Module
           A"

AFA Gene   Sure Jon, right after we answer Deanna's question. Deanna, you
           mean "Modulae?"

Deanna7332 Yes, that's it.

AFA Gene   Modulae was a demo written by FTA last year. (i'll get to you in a
           sec Doors).  It used SoundSmith v0.95 for all it's music. There
           is no connection between MOD files and Modulae by FTA.

Deanna7332 Throughout the demo it said "Loading modules"

AFA Gene   Those "modules" are not the same as Amiga soundfile "modules" --
           you see, what Modulae really was was a "stringing together" of a
           bunch of neat little tiny demos that FTA had written. So they
           called each little demo a "module" and thus the entire demo as a
           whole, "Modulae" (fancy plural of module?)

Deanna7332 Ok I understand.  Thank you. :)

AFL JoyceM Latin, Gene :)

AFA Gene   The term "MODule" from the Amiga comes from the idea that all the
           stuff needed to play the songfile (all the instruments + the
           sequence file) are included into one file, the "module."

TheDoors1  Gene, I have tried to d/l some recent uploaded MODs in the PC
           music area and still the problem exists.

AFA Gene   As I understand it, the problem was fixed VERY recently (correct
           me on this Joyce) and files uploaded as recently as early
           November still might not work depending on the version of the
           PCAO software that the uploader used.

AFL JoyceM Actually, Gene...I was under the impression that it had been, but
           if Doors is still having a problem, then it must not be fixed.

AFA Gene   What date was the file you tried to d/l, Door?

TheDoors1  umm 11/17, around there

AFA Gene   hmmm.... well i can tell you one thing... if it didn't work, don't
           waste your time again later... the problem is in the Apple
           software's method of d/lling files, and there are no plans to
           upgrade the Apple AO software.

AFL JoyceM I will endeavor to get an answer to that PC downloading
           problem/question :)

ThomasK63  i have a quick question... what can you use to unpack amiga mod
           files? On the PC side, that is.

TheDoors1  Agate Thomas

ELECTMUSIC Doors... what happens on after downloading..

Deanna7332 If it's LZHed you can't unless you have an IBM or
           PC/Transporter.

AFA Gene   If GS-ShrinkIt doesn't have that ability, i don't think there
           exists any such utility on the GS.

TheDoors1  What do you mean Elect?

ELECTMUSIC After you download the file... where do you encounter a problem?

TheDoors1  ok, you know when you download the file and at some point in the
           download the file starts to appear on your screen.  That's when I
           cancel it.

ThomasK63  I am sure soething good can be made w/out resorting to Amiga
           files

AFC Eddie  Yes, Doors, I believe the problem is with the PC software it was
           UL'd with.

TheDoors1  yeah Eddie.

GNO Tim    Amiga MOD files are typically compressed using LHarc.  I've
           uncompressed several on my Unix machine at school.

ThomasK63  good time for someone to make a lharc unpacker...

AFC DYAJim someone might be ;)

GNO Tim    Several people are already

AFC Eddie  Can't wait, Jim!

AFA Gene   Jon, did you have a question?

JonL7      The features of Noisetracker :)

AFA Gene   Oh yes... okay, here goes, in a nutshell, from most important to
           least:


AFA Gene   *  ability to import MOD files

           *  ability to import Soundsmith files

           *  ProDOS 8 based

           *  virtually no editing abilities (not a feature but important to
           know)

AFC DYAJim :)

AFA Gene   *  forgot: and the most important feature of all, the ability to
           hold instrument files in regular system RAM instead of DOC RAM,
           allowing for instruments far beyond the regular 64K limit found
           in ALL other GS music programs.

ThomasK63  I'll buy that!

TheDoors1  I have another question...when you're ready.

AFA Gene   GA Doors

TheDoors1  ok..is it true that NoiseTracker will take in soundsmith files and
           play them more clearly

AFA Gene   Well, as far as "what you hear," yes there is a definite
           difference with some instruments. It does NOT play the sounds
           more "clearly," but it just plays them in a different way. What
           many people seem to like about this "different way" is that
           sustained instruments (i.e. instruments designed to be played
           in a loop to simulate a long held note) seem to work better (or
           perhaps simply the way they were originally intended to work).

TheDoors1  I see

Deanna7332 Which takes up more space - MOD or NT  w/soundfile ?

AFA Gene   Deanna, it depends a few things, such as how big the sequence is,
           how many instruments you have, etc. Once you have a lot of
           assorted files, it'll probably average out to be about the same
           give or take a hundred blocks on your HD. So it basically depends
           on whether you prefer to have your instruments separate or not.

Deanna7332 Does playing quality differ with either one ?

AFA Gene   Nope. It's exactly the same either way. Loading time is the same
           too.

AFC Eddie  Can NT save songs as MOD files?

AFA Gene   Nope. It has options for Open and Close module, but these are
           still inactive.

AFA Gene   If there are no more questions, I'd like to talk about which NT
           files out there are the "hottest," since this info could be
           useful to many users who are interested in downloading NT/MOD
           files.

           My personal favorite is "Lambada," which is supplied by FTA with
           the program but is available separately on America
           Online.Everything about this file is really impressive except
           perhaps the sound quality of the horn-ish melody instrument.

           What about y'all, what are your favorite NT files?

AFL JoyceM Gene, there is a classical song for NT, but can't remember the
           name, but it is good.

AFC Eddie  I like Dragnet!

ELECTMUSIC So do I Ed

TheDoors1  I like Seven something

Deanna7332 My most favorite of all mod files is Pleasure Principle

AFC Eddie  <--appreciate's Greg's taste!

AFL JoyceM :)

AFA Gene   Deanna, i assume you got that from a local board?

Deanna7332 I got it from the PC forum here.

TheDoors1  I saw it there also

Deanna7332 I think under "Pleasure"

AFA Gene   Would you be able to upload it here? If it's really that good, we
           ought to have it available directly in our oun NT lib here (BTW
           folks, we will be releasing a new NoiseTracker software library
           soon!)

AFC Eddie  What a Forum!!!

Deanna7332 That sounds great!

AFL JoyceM Gene, do you think it will be possible for synthLAB files to be
           converted to MOD files?

AFL JoyceM MOD files?

AFA Gene   I doubt it, Joyce. The formats are so diametrically opposed in
           their entire basis of their file formats that it wouldn't be
           worth the time for a programmer to develop such a convertor.

Deanna7332 Isn't it possible to move the mod file from the PC forum to our
           music library?

AFA Gene   But..... it might be worth the time for a MIDI File Format to MOD
           convertor, since these two formats are more widely accepted.

Nuzz       they have nothing better to do Gene

ELECTMUSIC Gene.. some interesting similarities with DTune and NTracker

AFA Gene   They lose the file, tho, Deanna. :)

AFL JoyceM In what way, Greg?

ELECTMUSIC Both Prodos 8

Deanna7332 Shhh they won't know a thing :)

ELECTMUSIC I also believe Bill uses a shuttling of sound data between Doc
           Ram and Ram.

AFC Eddie  Interesting, Greg.

ELECTMUSIC Thats how he gets some of the excellent instrument quality

AFC Eddie  But Diversitune has that one distinction:  MIDI input.

AFL JoyceM Deanna, we would greatly appreciate it if you would upload that
           'Pleasure' song to our library :)

ELECTMUSIC Agreed Ed.. one of the factors FTA doesn't like to incorporate
           into their programs.

Deanna7332 I'll u/l it tonight if possible.

AFL JoyceM Thanks :)

AFC Eddie  Thanks, Deanna!

AFL JoyceM I will send Bill B a copy of NoiseTracker + some MOD files...to
           see what comments we get from him (will send when I get back).

AFC DYAJim What ever happened to that diversitune upgrade that was talked
           about ?

ELECTMUSIC That would be interesting Joyce

AFC Eddie  Bill apparently still working on it, Jim.

ELECTMUSIC I am sure he would appreciate the Prodos 8

AFC DYAJim good..

AFL JoyceM Jim...RSN....he was hoping by Christmas (this year), but he is
           soooo busy with his job, who knows?

AFC DYAJim Oh yeah, I noticed the speed calcuation in NT .5 is inaccurate
           :)

AFC DYAJim I recall he has set a lot of Christmas projected dates :)

ELECTMUSIC He was one of the first "Free Tools" experts in breaking all the
           rules for economic sake.

AFC DYAJim like for the vaporware DT inst editor like 2 years ago.

Deanna7332 Are there any Christmas Mod or NT songs?

AFC Eddie  Oh yeah, Diversi-Editor!

AFL JoyceM I know, Jim - but that I know he has been working on.

AFC DYAJim he projected Christmas for it, and it never came :)

AFA Gene   Not yet in AMS, but hopefully the Holiday Contest will change all
           that. :)

AFC DYAJim I look foreward to any upgrades..

AFL JoyceM Not that I am aware of Deanna - you have some?  hint, hint

Deanna7332 Nope sorry.  I was hoping there were some that could be u/led
           here

AFC DYAJim I'll be breaking out the xmas tune book rsn.. I should be able to
           midi a few :) (which rules out nt)

AFL JoyceM Question...

AFC Eddie  It would be more appropriate to have a converter from Appleworks
           spreadsheet to MOD than from MIDI!

AFL JoyceM If I got ahold of an Amiga song (MOD) disk...how would I convert
           them for here?

AFA Gene   You mean an Amiga-formatted disk?

AFL JoyceM Yes

AFC DYAJim Ack.. methinks you need an amiga and a null modem cable or a
           modem.

AFA Gene   Methinks Jim is right

AFC DYAJim LOL!!  Design your music in the spreadsheet then import to NT :)
           IT might actually have better editing?!! :)

AFC Eddie  Right!

AFL JoyceM Me thinks he is right.  If I had them upload to me, would that
           work?

AFA Gene   Yep; should work like a charm.

AFC DYAJim Yah.. as long as they're coming from an amiga

AFL JoyceM Great....I will work on that when I get back  (making note now).

AFL JoyceM Gene, will you get some of those files (NT) sent to that area
           tonight?  If so, I will leave the needed message :)

AFA Gene   That's all I have planned for tonight's chat, Joyce. Yep, I'll
           move some files right now.

AFL JoyceM Thanks...

AFL JoyceM Then we should have our NoiseTracker Library by end of the week in
           AMS :)

ELECTMUSIC Gene... quick question:  Are you launching NTracker from a 3.5
           disk?

AFL JoyceM Okay, guys...I will see you all the week of December 11th (may the
           4th) as I am off on vacation.

AFA Gene   Yep greg

AFC JohnC  Where are you going?

ELECTMUSIC Do you encounter out of memory problems

AFL JoyceM Night all...and Gene, thanks for an excellent chat and great
           explanations of NoiseTracker.

Nuzz       Joyce, I have good news for FutureSound owners. SoundConvert will
           support it in the first release

AFC Eddie  Great, Mike!

AFA Gene   Greg, i always keep my RAMdisk at 0 when using noisetracker. Not
           only are

AFC JohnC  Mike...SoundConvert...released?

AFL JoyceM Great, Mike.  When can we get SoundConvert, Mike? and FutureSound
           :)

AFA Gene   there a couple of bugs with memory management, but if you're
           loading in a MOD file that's really big, NT will eat your RAMdisk.

AFC Eddie  Sounds good.

Nuzz       The manual is being "layout". Release date should be about 1st
           week of Dec

ELECTMUSIC Tnxs Gene

AFC JohnC  YES.......WTG Nuzz!!!!!!!!

Deanna7332 Yes, why is there on some MOD files a stop somewhere in the middle
           ?

Deanna7332 That's really frustrating!

AFL JoyceM Mike, leave me E-Mail on when and how I can send your the $$ to
           get it.

AFL JoyceM Again...night all

Nuzz       gee John, I had to do something to explain the delay :)

ELECTMUSIC Thanks Gene for a GREAT chat!

AFC Eddie  Yes, Gene!  Great!

AFA Gene   Thanks Greg, 'night!

AFA Gene   thanx, see y'all later :)

Copyright 1987 Bob Szekely.

    John Michael Osbourne, (known as "Ozzy" to his fans), has in his long 
career as vocalist for Black Sabbath had his work with the group misconstrued 
as advocating Satanism.  In a 1983 radio special featuring Ozzy, the 
interviewer expressed precisely this point; "...Ozzy has always been shrouded 
in the darkest of Satanic imagery.  Yet if you really listen to his music, 
you'll find that what he is saying differs greatly from his image...."(1)  Even 
the group's image has often been described as "occult and diabolic".(2)

    The important point to remember here is to differentiate between appearance 
and reality.  Although the name "Black Sabbath" conjures up images of witches 
and sorcerers paying homage to Satan for the powers bestowed upon them, this 
does not make it safe to assume that the group that went by this name 
necessarily drew the inspiration from the occult.(3)  The closest they ever 
came to it was a gothic horror film featuring Boris Karloff as narrator; they 
adopted their name directly from the name of this film.(4)  Black Sabbath was 
involved in the black arts as much as Karloff practiced casting spells off-
screen.  Tony Iommi, the group's guitarist, summed it up best when he described 
the group as having basically "...the same appeal as a horror movie.  It's all 
an act."(5)










    Just as their film counterpart did, Ozzy and Sabbath found the occult 
mythos to be an effective vehicle for powerful social commentary; particularly 
when put in the context of heavy-metal rock and roll.  Ozzy himself noted that 
there are "...people who pick up my [album] cover[s] and go...'This guy's got 
to be singing about Devil, doom, death and destruction.'  Which is not the 
case...."(6)

    The late Lester Bangs likened the group to Bob Dylan and William Burroughs, 
describing them all as "...moralists...trying to deal with a serious present 
situation in an honest way...."(7)  Ozzy and Black Sabbath merely bring to 
light the many evils of our world in their work, to try and make us realize 
that we are all victim to their influence.  They hope to make us recognize 
these evils so that we may take up arms against them; a point Ozzy emphatically 
stresses:  "...one thing everybody has got to understand about Black Sabbath's 
lyrics.  They're not downer lyrics, they're just telling everybody where it's 
at..."(8)  He also cites the group's most controversial tune, "Black Sabbath", 
as a response to the ignorant hippie culture still force when the tune was 
written in 1970:  "The hippies said: 'The world is beautiful man.' (sic)  You 
only had to look around you to see how crappy it was.  It was ridiculous 
listening to that stuff, let alone playing it, so we just wrote about the world 
the way it really was and how it affected us - and we felt better in ourselves 
because we were really being honest...."(9)

    I   1   HAVE YOU EVER THOUGH ABOUT YOUR SOUL-
        2   CAN IT BE SAVED?
        3   OR PERHAPS YOU THINK THAT WHEN YOU ARE DEAD
        4   YOU JUST STAY IN YOUR GRAVE.
        5   IS GOD JUST A THOUGHT WITHIN YOUR HEAD OR IS
        6   HE A PART OF YOU?
        7   IS CHRIST JUST A NAME THAT YOU READ IN A BOOK
        8   WHEN YOU WERE AT SCHOOL?

    II  9   WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT DEATH DO YOU LOSE
        10  YOUR BREATH OR DO YOU KEEP YOUR COOL?
        11  WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE THE POPE ON THE END
        12  OF A ROPE - DO YOU THINK HE'S A FOOL?
        13  WELL I'VE SEEN THE TRUTH - YES I'VE SEEN 
        14  THE LIGHT AND I'VE CHANGED MY WAYS.
        15  AND I'LL BE PREPARED WHEN YOU'RE LONELY 
        16  AND SCARED AT THE END OF OUR DAYS.

    III 17  COULD IT BE YOU'RE AFRAID OF WHAT YOU'R
        18  FRIENDS MIGHT SAY 
        19  IF THEY NEW YOU BELIEVED IN GOD ABOVE
        20  THEY SHOULD REALISE BEFORE THE CRITICISE
        21  THAT GOD IS THE ONLY WAY TO LOVE.

    IV  23  IS YOUR MIND SO SMALL THAT YOU HAVE TO FALL
        24 IN WITH THE PACK WHEREVER THEY RUN
        25  WILL YOU STILL SNEER WHEN DEATH IS NEAR
        26  AND SAY THEY MAY AS WELL WORSHIP THE SUN.

    V   27  I THINK IT WAS TRUE IT WAS PEOPLE LIKE YOU
        28  THAT CRUCIFIED CHRIST
        29  I THINK IT IS SAD THE OPINION YOU HADE WAS THE
        30  ONLY ONE VOICED.
        31  WILL YOU BE SO SURE WHEN YOUR DAY IS NEAR
        32  SAY YOU DON'T BELIEVE?
        33  YOU HAD THE CHANCE BUT YOU TURNED IT DOWN
        34  NOW YOU CAN'T RETRIEVE.










    VI  35  PERHAPS YOU'LL THINK BEFORE YOU SAY THAT
        36  GOD IS DEAD AND GONE
        37  OPEN YOUR EYES, JUST REALIZE THAT HE IS THE
        38  ONE.
        39  THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN SAVE YOU KNOW FROM
        40  ALL THIS SIN AND HATE.
        41  OR WILL YOU STILL JEER AT ALL YOU HEAR?
        42  YES!-I THINK IT'S TOO LATE.

    In this piece, the group asserts a belief in an afterlife and spiritual 
redemption.  As grisly as the image of a hanged pontiff is, its shock value is 
a necessary part of the message:  They reject religious dogma, stating that a 
belief in God, in one's own heart, is the only guiding light to help one inn 
his life (lines 11/12, 39/40).  Furthermore, the reject religious hypocrisy 
(lines 5/6, 7/8) and peer pressure (verses III, IV) as excuses for not 
accepting God.  To clarify further:  following the crowd does not justify 
shrugging responsibility for one's own actions.

    After re-reading, it becomes obvious that this song is an ascerbic critique 
of atheism; (line 35/36) I refer here again to verses three and four.  In these 
two verses, the picture painted in one of Godless conformity and how it's 
viewed as being as foolish as Paganism.  These lyrics set an example for the 
listener by relating personal experience (lines 13-16).  However, for those who 
cannot accept this the group has no recourse but to condemn them, although 
rather ironically; they hope that their rhetorical loss of faith in the 
listener will open his eyes (line 42).










                           B L A C K   S A B B A T H 



            WHAT IS THIS, THAT STANDS BEFORE ME?
            FIGURE IN BLACK, WHICH POINTS AT ME
            TURN ROUND QUICK AND START TO RUN
            FIND OUT I'M THE CHOSEN ONE.  OH, NO!
            
            BIG BLACK SHAPE WITH EYES OF FIRE
            TELLING PEOPLE THEIR DESIRE
            SATAN'S SITTING THERE, HE'S SMILING
            WATCHES THOSE FLAMES GET HIGHER AND HIGHER
            OH, NO, NO, -- PLEASE GOD HELP ME!
            
                IS THIS THE END MY FRIEND?
                SATAN'S COMING 'ROUND THE BEND
                PEOPLE RUNNING 'CAUSE THEY'RE SCARED
                THE PEOPLE BETTER GO AND BEWARE
                NO, NO!  PLEASE--NO!!
                
                
    The all time controversy winner!  Is this not irrefutably  THE song about 
Black Magic in rock?  It's all so obvious, suffuse with evil imagery; Satan, 
walls of flame, figure in black, and damnation at the end.  Yes, I see the 
images too; it definitely concerns Black Magic.  Then again, Shakespeare's 
Macbeth employed scenes of witches involved in conjurations; does that mean 
that Shakespeare was a warlock?  Poe used to write sardonic tragedies about 
twisted murderers and the bizarre nature of acts, did that make him an evil, 
leering, demented killer?  Did either of them advocated what they wrote about?  
One has to remember that writing about something is not necessarily the same as 
emulating it.  Tony Iommi spoke out quite strongly about this:  "People are 
bringing us down saying that we are a Black Magic group.  I think they must be










getting mixed up with Black Widow.  We don't do any sacrifices on stage, and 
we're not on a black magic kick.  We wanted to do heavy numbers and the guitar 
riffs we worked out were more suited to evil things than love.  We play songs 
about black magic, but they are more likely to be against than for it."(12)  

    By now, you're probably asking yourself who Black Widow is, right?  Then 
it's time for a little history:

        Sabbath, before they were known as Sabbath, had the same line-up but 
two earlier names.  The first one was Polka Tulk, which seemed sure to doom 
them to obscurity.(13)  The soon realized this and changed the group's name to 
Earth.  Now, Earth was a blues band at the end of the English blues boom.  As 
if that wasn't bad enough, they soon discovered that not only was there another 
group named Earth, but they had also released a single.  To avoid confusion, 
they changed their name again.(14)  But what made them decide on that name?  
Just ask Ozzy:  "I just liked the name Black Sabbath because of the succession 
of vowel sounds.(15)  If that sounds ludicrous just consider this:  Sabbath was 
"...the first of the really committed, loud and heavy bands..."(16)  They 
needed a name to match the gut-wrenching power they were developing.  Tony knew 
that he wanted Sabbath to be noticed above all the rest of the British blues 
bands:  "We wanted something of our own that we'd like and people would like.  
And we wanted something loud!"










    Tony didn't hate the blues.  He'd cut his teeth as a guitarist on the likes 
of The Shadows, Buddy Holly and Django Rheinhardt, developing his own style 
from there.  But he realized the group had no future in the blues:

        'We couldn't keep playing 12-bars forever.  We just got fed up with 
Earth music.  It was jazz, blues stuff.  It was good for practice but nothing 
else.'

    In the late 'Sixties, blues groups were a dime a dozen in Birmingham and 
interest was waning in the blues boom due to the glut of groups.  One man, by 
the name of Jim Simpson, had heard Earth around the Birmingham club circuit and 
understood what they were trying to do.  He decided to take them under his 
wing.  With the aid of his massive record collection, Jim expanded the group's 
horizons in the areas of jazz and blues.  He introduced them to artists like 
Wes Montgomery, Count Basie and Jimmy Rushing.  It was from Rushing in 
particular that they derived the repetitive riff style so readily noticeable in 
their later incarnation as Black Sabbath.

    The Count Basie influence is evidenced in the song "Wicked World" from the 
first album; Sabbath drummer Bill Ward uses a "'sighing hi-hat'...in the manner 
of Basie's drummer Jo Jones."










    The influence is subtle, almost subliminal.  Yet it is one which was not 
thought capable of hard, 'heavy' rock bands in the late 'Sixties.  Although Led 
Zeppelin and Jimi Hendrix also had their work steeped in blues and jazz 
derivations (Hendrix' "Third Stone From the Sun" and Zeppelin's version of 
Willie Dixon's "I Can't Quit You Baby" from their first album), neither was 
able to match the intense energy of Black Sabbath.  Iommi has always had a 
preference for music with an original, distinct style of its' own; as an 
example, he mentions guitarists Joe Pass and Alvin Lee as two of his strongest 
songwriting influences.

    It would also be necessary that Sabbath develop a unique, distinctive style 
and image of their own.  Though they had changed their name from Earth to Black 
Sabbath to avoid confusion with the other Earth; at the same time another group 
emerged by the name of Black Widow "...who WERE profoundly influenced by the 
occult, had a male witch as a patron, and wrote pieces like "Come to The 
Sabbat."  Unfortunately, Sabbath was constantly reaping the benefits of Widow's 
publicity.

    Sabbath was a group that never minced words.  If they saw something as 
destructive, they would be sure to rub the listener's face it it.  They did not 
want their point to be missed.

    With their straightforward, sometimes brutal way of looking at things, they 
try to shock the listener's conscience back into awareness.  The imagery of 
"Hand of Doom", from the Paranoid album, is candid and condemning; it is a 
strong statement against drug addiction and rightly so...

    Many people felt the group's overall direction was pessimistic and had a 
negative effect on its listener's due to that.  "Ozzy insisted that if people 
thought he was having a bad effect on the minds of young kids, they should go 
and watch the TV news where real murder and mayhem were a way of life, and 
shown night after night." (18)

    Sabbath was never negative in their message; they were simply truthful 
about waht they saw as wrong in the world.  If you "Strip away the horror 
stories, the imagery and the hysteria, (and) turn down the amps a notch...you 
have a well-rehearsed, solid blues and rock band, powered by a dedication to 
well defined objectives."  On the top of the list of those objectives was 
truth; Sabbath never feared facing that truth squarely, regardless of what many 
people thought of them.

                          "Raw Data for Raw Nerves"
X-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-X
Long, long, time ago,
I can still remember,
When the local calls were "free".
And I knew if I paid my bill,
And never wished them any ill,
That the phone company would let me be...

But Uncle Sam said he knew better,
Split 'em up, for all and ever!
We'll foster competition:
It's good capital-ism!

I can't remember if I cried,
When my phone bill first tripled in size.
But something touched me deep inside,
The day... Bell System... died.

And we were singing...

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
"Our local calls have us in hock!" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

Is your office Step by Step,
Or have you gotten some Crossbar yet?
Everybody used to ask...
Oh, is TSPS coming soon?
IDDD will be a boon!
And, I hope to get a Touch-Tone phone, real soon...

The color phones are really neat,
And direct dialing can't be beat!
My area code is "low":
The prestige way to go!

Oh, they just raised phone booths to a dime!
Well, I suppose it's about time.
I remember how the payphones chimed,
The day... Bell System... died.

And we were singing...

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
"Our local calls have us in hock!" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

Back then we were all at one rate,
Phone installs didn't cause debate,
About who'd put which wire where...
Installers came right out to you,
No "phone stores" with their ballyhoo,
And 411 was free, seemed very fair!

But FCC wanted it seems,
To let others skim long-distance creams,
No matter 'bout the locals,
They're mostly all just yokels!

And so one day it came to pass,
That the great Bell System did collapse,
In rubble now, we all do mass,
The day... Bell System... died.

So bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
"Our local calls have us in hock!" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

I drove on out to Murray Hill,
To see Bell Labs, some time to kill,
But the sign there said the Labs were gone.
I went back to my old CO,
Where I'd had my phone lines, years ago,
But it was empty, dark, and ever so forlorn...

No relays pulsed,
No data crooned,
No MF tones did play their tunes,
There wasn't a word spoken,
All carrier paths were broken...

And so that's how it all occurred,
Microwave horns just nests for birds,
Everything became so absurd,
The day... Bell System... died.

So bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
"Our local calls have us in hock!" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

We were singing:

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
"Our local calls have us in hock!" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?

Though she's pretty wild and flighty    We will all sing Hare Krishna

It was good enough for Loki         We will all go to Nirvana

Here's to those who copy Conan    There will be a lot of lovin

They're just Followers of Onan    Quit yer pushin and yer shovin
and that's good enough for me!    So there's room enough for me!

We will have a mighty Party           It was good enough for Sappho
In the honor of Astarte               With her lady on her lap-o
Grab your chiton - don't be tardy     She put Lesbos on the map-o
'Cause she's good enough for me!      With her pagan poetry!

Shall we sing a verse for Venus,    Well the Christians all are humming
Of the Gods she is the meanest,     Cause they say their God is coming,
Cause she bit me on my...elbow      Our God came three times this evening
And it's good enough for me.        And that's good enough for me.

   Now here's a story, a little bit gory,
   A little bit happy, a little bit sad.
   About a drink called Imperium Compound
   And how the SCA's been had!                       

   Chorus: Oh we think, we think, we think,
           The King is a fink, a fink, a fink,
           A figure of respectability
           Rules the Kingdom thru Imperium Compound
           The results are plain to see!

   Mongol Hordemen, those free-living swordsmen
   Subverting the Kingdoms from underneath!
   Have no use for Imperium Compound
   Except perhaps to brush their teeth!

   AltChorus: Oh we fink, we fink, we fink,
              The Khan and the Kink, the Kink, the Kink,
              And the Board, their Great Senilities!
              The Western Irgun, drinks Imperium Compound
              And we're BACK, with results you'll see!    

   Lady Laurel, with Authority Royal,
   Passes and rejects our heraldry
   She needs a swig of Imperium Compound
   Then perhaps she'd deign to talk to me!            

   Lady Trude thought it her duty
   To turn a social wrong into a Right
   Proved her point with Imperium Compound
   And showed that Cheshire Cats can fight!  //and scratch//

   The Board of Directors styled themselves The Electors
   And another con they tried to swing
   Now the BoD drinks Imperium Compound
   So we no longer need a King!                        

   AltChorus: Oh the Bod, the BoD, the BoD,
              It thinks it is God, is God, is God,
              The figure of Supreme Authority!
              And if we O.D.'d on Imperium Compund
              there'd be no need for Royalty!          

   Oh, MEDIEVAL Net, we thought it was all wet
   With witty remarks, and other kinds of sass
   We'll feed our computers on Imperium Compound
   And BYTE the BoD right on its' righteous ass!         

   Good old Duncan was often drunken
   Chasing all the ladies fair
   He bathed himself in Imperium Compound
   Now he has a little savoir faire!

   Winning Crown after Crown after Crown!                 

   Good Duke Arthur couldn't get no farth-er
   A Norman King in Aten Land
   Drank too much of Imperium Compound
   And went off to conquer Engel-land!                    

   Then King Richard, a bit of a bitch, heard
   A King's Crown could be done.
   Drank a little Imperium Compound
   And became the Aten King, first one!                    

   Duchess Malinda, who doesn't do windas,
   But she does a lot of Duchess Things,
   But give her a LOT of Imperium Compound,
   And she sings and sings and sings and sings and sings!   

   Duke Sir Brion, with his pretty white suit on,
   Is a model of goodness and purity
   Never touches Imperium Compound
(spoken:) And I'll sell ya seashore property in Yuma, too!  

   Optional last verse:

   Many tales abound of Imperium Compound
   And its' strange effects on Royalty,
   But after an hour, this song has no power,
   And by now, it's boring ME!                            

   AltChorus: Oh it's too long, too long, too long
              To sing the whole song, the song, the song
              Longer than a Royal Court, it is!
              But sing it serial, this ditty Imperial
              And you'll be a bardic whiz!

        Last night I had the strangest dream in this bleak century
        I dreamed that people the world around believed in Chivalry

        I dreamed I saw a Kingly Crown enshrined in laurel leaves
        with Grace and Joy and Purity attendant at his feet

        I dreamed I saw the perfect Knight receive his accolade
        and minstrels sang and children laughed in some soft forest glade

        I dreamed I saw the finest thing that ever man could make
        grow great and strong and undefiled: Pray God I never wake!

        Last night I had the strangest dream in this bleak century
        I dreamed that people the world around believed in Chivalry

               (to the tune of "Good King Wenceslaus")

                Locksley Monsters never yield
                on the field of battle
                strike the helm and bash the shield
                make their eyeteeth rattle
                Bodies on the ground will lie
                bones will burst in sunder
                search for Locksleys' enemies:
                You'll find them six feet under!

                              SONG OF IVANOF

            There is a man who we know well that does the best he can
            but he's displayed in armour made of reticulated garbage cans!

            He looks so fine and fair and strong, oh how he plays the man
            and how it's prized, those galvanized, reticulated garbage cans

            The noblest Roman of them all, a good Praetorian
            a combatant who wears no pants, judst reticulated garbage cans!

            Like old Horatius at the Bridge, like the Legions of Valerian
            (O dearie me: those LOVELY knees!)
            and those reticulated garbage cans!

                         C. McCray Bethancourt

         (sung to the tune (obviously) of the 12 Days of Christmas)


1.           The first time I sent my device, The Heralds said to me

            "It violates the Rule of Three"

2.           The next time I tried it, the Heralds said to me

            "We changed the forms, and it violates the Rule of
             Three".

3.           The third time I tried, and the Heralds said to me, 

            "We upped the fees, we changed the forms, and it
             violates the Rule of Three".

4.           Another time I tried and the Heralds said to me,
 
            "We haven't got it, we upped the fees, we changed the 
             forms, and it violates the Rule of Three".

5.           The fifth time I tried it, the Heralds said to me,  

            "In a decision rendered by the College of Arms on
             August 1st, A.S. V it was decided that this style of
             heraldic design was not appropriate to the aims and 
             intentions of the Corporate Body. Holy! Holy! Holy! "

 note: verse 5 is delivered in an extremely fast, mono-
       tone, similiar to a Gregorian Chant.

           " ....we haven't got it, we upped the fees, we changed the forms,
             and it violates the Rule of Three."

6.           I tried it a sixth time, and the Heralds said to me,

            "We changed the rules, &c"

7.           A seventh time I tried and, the Heralds said to me,

            "It's against the Rule of Tincture, we changed the
             rules, &c"

8.           I tried it once again and the heralds said to me,

            "It's not a Period design, It's against the Rule of Tincture, We
             changed the rules, &c"

                                * more *



    Heralds Said To Me (cont.)

9.           I sent it in once more, and the Heralds said to me,

            "We changed the rules again, It's not a Period design,
             it's against the Rule of Tincture, we changed the
             rules, &c"

10. (sung in cold anger)
             The LAST time I sent my device, the Heralds said to me

    (sung in a state of SMUG)
             "Someone else has got it, &c"




              (nb: every single one of these reasons has been used by the
              CoA, at one point or another, to reject perfectly good
              heraldry, along with some even MORE stupid.  If the shoe 
              fits....................!!!!!!!!)

           or: Who was that Vermin I saw you with last, Knight?
   or: There may be Lice on all you Knice, but there ain't no Lice on me

           Once there was a Barony howling in the wilderness
           nestled in the Valley where the River doesn't flow
           and the folks were driven buggy by the insects in the Revel Hall
           Authenticity is wonderful, but this doesn't go!

                   Bugs on the Baroness, bugs on the Baroness!
                   That was the cry that you heard all the day
                   and the scratching can be heard from Ysgithr to Ered Sul
                   why did we come here? Let's go away!

           See them all a scratching, nestled in their armour tight
           the fleas have a melee team that's challenging the field!
           call Truly Nolen! Someone's gotta help us out!
           the crabs are nesting in our helms but we'll never yield!

                   (chorus)

           Dawn comes a-breaking, the bugs have won the Coronet...
           flea-infested Conan-clones in piles upon the lawn
           where is the Barony? The bugs have eaten everyone...
           termites got the stick-jocks, and all their sticks are gone!

                          tune: The West's Awake

                  For all the Lands where I have dwelt
                  Oh Atenveldt, Oh Atenveldt
                  till rivers burn and mountains melt
                  lest I forget my Atenveldt
                  From deserts stark to snow-capped peaks
                  from silent lakes and laughing creeks
                  sing: Oh let man find his heart's ease
                  on rocky plains
                  in desert breeze

                  For oft I thought of mighty men
                  who carved a Land with sword and pen
                  and lit a candle, burning bright,
                  that pierced the darkness; stirred the night!
                  tho some are gone their deeds remain
                  this sunny Crown without a stain
                  sing: Oh, their deeds were not in vain!
                  in sunlit days
                  and falling rain.....

                  So raise your banners, blazoned bright
                  Advance the Dream and Shine the Light!
                  in battle's crash and Revel's song
                  raise high the Flag and wave it long!
                  For all the Lands wherein I've dwelt
                  I love you best, my Atenveldt!
                  Sing: Oh the Joy that I have felt!
                  My Atenveldt
                  My Atenveldt

      What the use of wearing panties
      whalebone corsets of your Auntie's
      boxer shorts and other scanties
      best of all is nude
      there's such fun in going bra-less
      now that it's no longer lawless
      'specially if your figure's flawless
      best of all is nude
      nude is what you're born in
      shirts are never torn in
      underwear and lacy flimsies, garter belts and other whimsies
      yards of itchy cloth to put your form in
      ducks all do it, maidens rue it
      even ancient Picts in Britain blue it
      going naked's how to do it
      best of all is nude!

      If your garters aren't elastic
      tie them up in knots fantastic
      (panty hose is something drastic!)
      best of all is nude!
      If you're tired of wearing clotheses
      shed your garment 'mongst the roses
      never mind the old bluenoses
      best of all is nude!
      Nude is best for ducking!
      Worst for horses bucking!
      Moonlit nights will see such sights
          that are very best for fooling round
                              .....and elbows!
      Nudity is grand to see
       a well-known antidote to virginity
      take your clothes off and you'll see:
      best of all is nude!

                   once I talked to a great Grey Man
                   spun three times and said with a sigh

                   she went down underneath the hill
                   and came back out of her own free will

                   Brian Boru, on Irish ground
                   walked three times the Island round

                   got six feet of English ground

                   the Legion with it's Eagles bright
                   marched into the Pictish night
                   met them there upon the sand
                   gave em up to the Wicker Man!

                   eight-legged steed and hound of Hel
                   the one-eyed Man, he loves ya well

                   are you then feared of the dark?

                   The Circle forms, the Circle flows
                   the Circle goes where no man knows

                   Present is Past and Past is Me!

                   Rhiannon's Birds are still in flight

        Away out here they have a name for even the Ump that's Wuggly
        But the last word in Awfulness, M'Lady, you're The Ugly!

                M'Lady, M'Lady, they call the pigs M'Lady!

        Before I knew M'Lady's name and heard her constant whinin'
        I thought all girls were beautiful and the sun was always shinin'

        Then one day, M'Lady came, and stopped the clocks from tickin'
        she curdled milk, aborted cows, and stopped my stamps from stickin'!

                (chorus)

        Away out here they have a name for everything worth seein'
        but if M'Lady looks at you, then soon you will be fleein'

        M'Lady disappeared one day, and that for sure is scary
        she was the result of experiments by a deranged Vetinary!

                    WEAPONS AT THE DOOR

 Being a Polemic concerning the alleged Custom of the West Kingdom concerning 
 checking your Weapons at the Door of the Revel Hall. As the Satire is the 
 Weapon of the Bard, this said Polemic is to be checked at the Door, along with 
 swords, knives, redheaded Ladies and other such Deadly Things.....

         As I roved out to Western Lands to take the Western Air
         I went into a Revel Hall and I saw a Twelfth Night there
         but I was halted at the gate by a Privy Consellor
                 (that's the man who tells the King of the West how to go to
                  the bath room!)
         who told me I would have to check my Weapons at the door

         As I, in my astonishment, stood hung on tenter-pegs
         a Knight came in whose Prouess hung down between his legs
         the Doorman grabbed a greatsword and he struck the Knight full sore
         and gave him a reciept; he left his weapon at the door!

         a Bard was next whose goodly Voice has entertained us all
         but he, too, was prevented from entering the Hall
         and told he could not carry deadly weapons on the floor
         he left his Voice and Harp among the weapons at the door

         a Master entered graciously, a man we all know well
         who holds a 3rd Dan Black Belt, tho this he'd never tell
         the Master struggled valiantly, the Master cursed and swore
         but he left his hands, and feet, as weapons at the door

         the company was jovial, altho a bit dismayed
         for lack of proper cutlery, down to the smallest blade
         for even teeth and fingernails, each can be used in War
         were cut, and pulled, and left behind, as weapons at the door!

         And has their King not loyal Knights that He must be afraid
         of brawling in his Hall and of Assassin's bloody blade?
         the Rights of Men to carry Arms at least WE'VE not foreswore
         and a POX on them that made the Rule of Weapons at the Door!

                           THE STREETS OF ANN ARBOR

               As I walked out thru the streets of Ann Arbor
               as I walked out thru Ann Arbor one day
               I spied a young Mongol all dressed in white linen
               all dressed in white linen and cold as the clay

               I then spied another, done in on the sidewalk
               along with just about six dozen more
               their wounds were all gaping, from mace and from braoadsword
               from claymore and cannon, all dripping with gore

               what caused this grave carnage, I cried to the Monglos
               oh pray what's the reason for this awful sight
               my answer came slowly from under the corpse-pile
               "It seems that our bark is much worse than our bite....."

               the answer continued from pale lips a-shaking
               we sang all our songs and believed them as true
               the Dark Horde could never be beaten in battle
               we thought this was what all good Mongols could do...

               we went down to Atenveldt all for to plunder
               "too large to defend" was our song every night
               but Atenveldt's different from East, West or Middle
               there, even the bushes have learned how to bite!

               the Clann stole our ponies, the Scraelings our foodstuffs
               we ran into axes in AtenViking hands
               our maidens ran off with one Richard of Arkham
               and we're all that's left to return to our lands

               MacChluarains and Monsters, Lockehaven and Foxmoor
               that Kingdom is BIG and its' fighters are MEAN!
               we fought and we lost, and fled back to Ann Arbor
               we all came back home with results that you've seen

               keep away from that Land with its' cactus and marshes
               it's no place for Mongols who are bent on War
               they count their blows well, but they strick them yet better
               he crawled into his Yurt, and fell, dead, on the floor.....

       tune: the song of the Cowardly Lion, Tin Woodsman and Scarecrow
             in the movie version of the Wizard of Oz

        (Enter the Scarecrow, who singeth:)

        My wife is always nagging; my Prowess it is lagging
        I can't do anything
        she has got a reason, but revenge is out of season
        Oh I wish I could be King!

        If I just had the Crown on, I'd always have a frown on
        and the Barons on a string
        Heads they would be rolling, the Board would be cajoling
        Oh if only I was King!

        I am very fed up with the way this group is set up
        Oh I'd change everything!
        they are so high and mighty with the way that they do fight-ey
        Oh, someday I'll be King!

        Tho my wife is melancholic, and very...vitriolic
        she's a wasp without a sting!
        I'd have to supervise her with a pack of tranquilizers
        If I only was a King......

        (the Tin Woodsman joineth him, and singeth:)

        I grew up kind of cocky, and rather big, and stocky
        and straight as any rod
        on the field I'm a battallion, with the Ladies I'm a stallion
        ...Oh they'd better make me God!

        The other boys are jealous they say I'm over-zealous
        they'd do better to applaud
        the things that I am giving to this Dream that we are living
        oh I wish they'd make me God!

        They say that I'm conceited, but I'm just badly treated
        by people and by BoD
        just think of what they're missing by My Majesty dismissing
        Oh they'd better make me God!

        (the Cowardly Lion creepeth forth, and singeth:)

        Oh I could be a fighter, a great and mighty smiter
        and be the perfect knight
        it's a great and nasty shame, and everyone's to blame
        oh I wish that I could fight!

        Song of the Three (cont.)

        I could be a Cavalier drinking wine and ale and beer
        and be a gorgeous sight
        but it would cost me too much money so it isn't very funny
        oh I wish that I could fight!                               

        Let me at 'em on the field, I would surely make them yield
        to my Power and my Might
        with rattan, shinai and rapier they would nevermore escape here
        If they'd only let me fight

                She was afraid to come out to the Tourney
                She was worried that "something might show.."
                She was afraid to come out to the Tourney
                And the poor thing did NOT want to go...

                The Mongols invaded the Middle
                But the Middle did not want to play...

                  (eins - zwei - drei, but the Dark Horde wouldn't die!)

          Tom O'Bedlam's son am I, for my mind is hazy!
          I'd rather sing a song than work (if it's not too phrasey!)
          Lengthy rhymes don't bother me....truth to tell: I'm lazy!

          Yang, your yurt is very nice, and your Horde is smelly,
          And I'm sure that yak-meat will nicely fill one's belly!
          But remember this one line, or you're not worth jelly:
          FIRST you plunder, THEN you burn! That's how to be rakehelly!

          My Lady Lorelei your eyes do drive me to distraction

          Now Atenveldt your fighters, all, are most good and gentle
          And the Ladies, bless 'em all, are most ornamental!
          But that little Nikki-Toad....has me sentimental
          Though with boffer in her hand she is argumental!

          This stupid little song, m'lords, is mostly sung in Latin
          By the Goliards, of course, from vespers clear to matins!
          But I prefer a coarser cloth over silk or satins
          English is more understood, mine enemies to flatten!

          Good People all, I've made my Song, its' music's well-recited
          But my voice could use some work; the flowers it has blighted!
          It's rude and rusty, grim and bad, and squeaky like a door-hinge,
          But I'm a better Bard than you: I found a rhyme for "orange!"

                      by William Poundstone
                              1983

     Two mentalities are at work here: 1960s rock fans and 1980s
fundamentalist Christians. The idea of phonographically concealed
messages dates from the Paul McCartney death scare of 1969. For
hard-core types, the secret-message rumors never really died. Avid
rock fans have auditioned ever album release since the late 1960s
for hidden nuances. Backward messages, barely audible messages,
and messages on one stereo track only have been alleged. At the
other end of the sociosensual spectrum, fundamentalist Christians
have gotten into the act. TV programs such as PRAISE THE LORD and
THE 700 CLUB have propagated rumors of a satanic plot in the
recording industry, no less, in which various albums conceal
"backward-masked" demonic murmurings. If THAT sounds too spacey to
be taken seriously, consider that it was the fundamentalist groups
who were behind House Resolution 6363, a bill introduced in the
U.S. House of Representatives by Robert K. Dornan (R., Calif.) in
1982 to label all suspect records: "WARNING: THIS RECORD CONTAINS
BACKWARD MASKING THAT MAKES A VERBAL STATEMENT WHICH IS AUDIBLE
WHEN THIS RECORD IS PLAYED BACKWARD AND WHICH MAY BE PERCEPTIBLE
AT A SUBLIMINAL LEVEL WHEN THIS RECORD IS PLAYED FORWARD." In
February 1983, the Arkansas State Senate passed a similar record-
labeling bill by a vote of 86 to 0.
     Contributing to the quasi-occult status of these rumors is
the difficulty of checking them out on home audio equipment. You
pretty much have to take someone else's word for it, or dismiss
the rumors out of hand.
     From a technical standpoint, there are four simple ways to
conceal a verbal message on a recording. The most obvious is to
record the message at a very low volume. The message may then be
recovered by turning the volume up while playing the record or
tape. If the message is faint enough, though, noise levels of home
equipment may garble it. If the accompanying music or lyrics are
loud enough, or if the message itself is indistinct or
electronically modified, it may be hard to hear on any equipment.
     A second gimmick is to record a message on one stereo track
only. Records and tapes have two independent recordings, of
course, normally played simultaneously for stereo effect. On a
record, each stereo track occupies on one side of the V-shaped
groove for the needle. On a tape, the tracks are recorded in
parallel lanes of the magnetic material. The two tracks are called
"right" and "left" after the stereo speakers they will play on.
Otherwise, the tracks are interchangeable -- the sound mixer can
put anything he or she wants on each track. A message on one track
can be masked by simultaneous loud music or lyrics on the opposite
track. With normal stereo balance (or mono equipment) the loud
track drowns out the message track. At home, single-track messages
can be recovered by adjusting the stereo balance so that only the
desired track plays. Sometimes this trick also makes indistinct
words clearer. Even if the words are not exclusively on one track,
they may happen to be more audible on one track.
     A message could be recorded at a speed different from the
rest of the record. Then the record would have to be played faster
or slower than usual to recover the message. Unless the message
was at one of the standard speeds (say, 45 rpm on a 33 1/3 rpm
record), it could not be played normally on home equipment.
     The fourth and most commonly alleged trick is to record a
verbal message backward. Reversed speech has several unexpected
features. One is that syllables are not a constant in the reversal
process. A one-syllable word can have two or three syllables when
played backward. Thus "number nine" in the Beatles' REVOLUTION 9
reverses to "Turn me on, dead man" (or something like it), a jump
from three to five syllables.
     There is no simple way to predict what a word or phrase will
sound like reversed. Obviously, you can't just reverse the
letters.
     Reversed messages are difficult to recover at home. Record
turntables are not built to go backwards. Some have a neutral
setting, in which the pickup and amplifier remain active and you
can turn the record backward by hand. But hardly anyone has a
stead enough hand to produce satisfactory results.
     With patience, it is possible to reverse a cassette
recording. Transfer the music from the original record or tape
onto a blank tape cassette. Place the cassette flat on a table.
Draw our the part of the tape with the suspected message and snip
it off at both ends. Hold the tape segment horizontally. Rotate it
180 degrees, keep it horizontal at all times. This turns the tape
end for end. Splice the reversed tape segment back onto the two
loose ends of the cassette with strong adhesive tape. Reel the
tape back inside the cassette. The sliced segment will play
backward on an ordinary cassette player.
     I rented a recording studio to test the secret-message
rumors. New copiies of the records in question were transcribed on
a quarter-inch master tape. Where rumor alleged that a single
stereo track contained a message, right and left stereo tracks
were transcribed separately. Records with alleged inaudible
messages were treated similarly. To test claims of reversed
messages, recordings on the master tape were edited out and
spliced in backward. Twenty cuts or portions of cuts from sixteen
albums were tested.


"Another One Bites the Dust"
Queen, THE GAME

Rumor: When played backward, the lyrics say, "It's fun to smoke
marijuana."
Findings: There is something that sounds like "It's fun to smoke
marijuana" in the reversed music. It is repeated over and over. It
might be rendered no less faithfully, however, as "sfun to scout
mare wanna." This "message" is the reversal of the song title,
which is repeated as a line in the song.
     Let's make a distinction between engineered and phonetic
reversals. When an artist records a verbal statement, reverses it
by turning the tape end for end, mixes the reversed statement onto
a master tape, and has records and tapes produced from the master,
that is an engineered reversal. When the phonetic properties of
song lyrics are such that they can be reversed to sound like
something else, that is a phonetic reversal.
     "It's fun to smoke marijuna" is clearly a phonetic reversal.
The lyrics are perfectly plain played forward ("Another one bites
the dust"), no so plain played backward ("sfun to scout mare
wanna"). With an engineered reversal, the opposite should hold
true: gibberish forward, clear as a bell backward. Some are
prepared to believe that phonetic reversals are just as
intentional as engineered reversals -- that the songwriter
painstakinginly planned the phonetic double-entendre. In the
absence of confirming evidence, that just doesn't wash. It's too
easy to find coincidences. If, for example, the letters of the
alphabet are recited in conventional fashion (Ay, Bee, Cee, etc.)
and reversed, at least five sound like English language words. D
reverses to "eden," F becomes "pray," S becomes "say," V becomes
"even," and Z becomes "easy." "It's fun to smoke marijuana" is
likewise a coincidence.


"A Child is Coming"
Jefferson Starship, BLOWS AGAINST THE EMPIRE

Rumor: When played backward, "son of Satan."
Findings: Another phonetic coincidence. The repeated "It's getting
better" reverses to an iffy "son of Satan," the "of" drawn out and
the "Satan" strongly accented on the first syllable.


"Eldorado"
Electric Light Orchestra, ELDORADO

Rumor: When played backward, "He is the nasty one/ Christ, you're
infernal/ It is said we're dead men/ Everyone who has the mark
will live."
Findings: Coincidence. The supposed message lurks around the line
"On a voyage of no return to see." Reversed, this passage becomes
the expected syllable salad -- no one hearing it would describe it
as anything but reversed music. Only if you listen while reading
along with what you're supposed to hear will you get anything. The
rumored version of the message is somewhat fudged. The passage
sounds more like "He's to nasty one/ Christ you are, Christ,
you're fernal/ There wiss uh, we're dead men..." There is no "in"
in what is taken to be "infernal." The line that is supposed to be
"Everyone who has the mark will live" isn't even close, though the
syllable count is right.


"Shoo Be Doo"
The Cars, CANDY-O

Rumor: When played backward, the word "Satan" repeated
approximately eleven times.
Findings: Coincidence. The rumor refers to the reversal of the "Shoo
be doo, shoo be doo, shoo be doo..." near the end of the song. Given
the mysterious logic of reversed phonemes, these three-syllable units
can be hard as a repeated two-syllable word. The word sounds a little
like "Satan."


"Snowblind"
Styx, PARADISE THEATER

Rumor: According to a mimeographed list of suspect records distributed
by Congressman Dornan, the words "Satan move through our voices" when
played backwards.
Findings: Negative. Despite repeated listenings, it was not even
possible to identify the part of the reversed track that Dornan et al.
are talking about.


"Stairway to Heaven"
Led Zeppelin, untitled, a.k.a. STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN

Rumor: In reverse, "I live for Satan... The Lord turns me off...
There's no escaping it... Here's to my sweet Satan... There's power in
Satan... He will give you 666."
Findings: Coincidence. If you listen very carefully to the "And it
makes me wonder" lines in reverse, you'll hear something approaching
"There's no escaping it." A better description is "There's no escape
do." Knock of the last syllable, and you have "There's no escape," a
complete, intelligible sentence in reverse. It's there, all right, but
it's not an unlikely enough coincidence to -- well, make you wonder.
      The "Satan" in "I live for Satan" is good and clear. The "I live
for" part isn't. The other alleged lines are unremarkable. All are
phonetic reversals of the entirely lucid forward lyrics and obviously
just accidents.


"When Electricity Came to Arkansas"
Black Oak Arkansas, BLACK OAK ARKANSAS and RONCH AND ROLL

Rumor: In reverse, "Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan. He is God. He
is God."
Findings: The BLACK OAK ARKANSAS cut was reversed. Again, pairs of
reversed syllables are being freely interpreted as "Satan." "He is
God" was not identifiable.


"Rain"
The Beatles, HEY JUDE

Rumor: Unintelligible lyrics at the end are reversed.
Findings: A true engineered reversal and not really a secret. "Rain"
seems to have been the first popular recording to incorporate an
obviously reversed lyric. The story is that John Lennon accidentally
spliced the last part of the song in backward and liked the effect.
When reversed, the strange-sounding vocals at the end become
intelligible as a reprise starting with the drawn-out word
"sunshine."
      The reversal is less apparent to the casual listener than it
might be because the accompanying music is not reversed. The ending
fits in smoothly with the rest of the song, the vocals suggesting a
foreign language.


"Fire on High"
Electric Light Orchestra, FACE THE MUSIC

Rumor: When played backward, "The music is reversible, but time --
turn back!"
Findings: "Fire on High" is instrumental. About twenty-six seconds
into the music, scrambled speech is heard. It is mostly louder than
the accompanying music and begins with a two-syllable unit repeated
several times. The seeming speech lasts for about fourteen seconds.
      Reversing the music confirms that there is a true, engineered
message. In reverse, a voice (Jeff Lynne's?) says, "The music is
reversible, but time -- turn back! Turn back! Turn back! Turn back!"
All the words are clear and unambiguous. Anyone comparing this to the
alleged reversal on ELO's "Eldorado" will have no trouble telling
which is genuine.


"Goodbye Blue Sky"
Pink Floyd, THE WALL

Rumor: In reverse, "You have discovered the secret message."
Findings: The "secret message" is at the very end of the instrumental
passage following the "Goodbye Blue Sky" vocals. It comes just before
the words "What shall we do" at the start of the song that is
identified as "Empty Spaces" on the record label and as "What shall we
do now?" on the record sleeve. Played forward, the message is less
apparent than the FACE THE MUSIC reversal: A reasonably attentive
listener might play THE WALL through and not catch it. It suggests
speech not quite close enough to be overheard. In context this is not
unusual because the "Goodbye Blue Sky" instrumental passage includes
"airport noises" and other sound effects. A loud climax in the music
further masks the unintelligible voice.
      When played backward, the voice (Roger Waters?) plainly intones,
"Congratulations, you have just discovered the secret message. Please
send your answer to old Pink, care of the funny farm..." As the voice
fades out, there may be another word -- perhaps "Chalfonte or
"Chelsea" -- after "funny farm."


"Heavy Metal Poisoning"
Styx, KILROY WAS HERE

Rumor: A red sticker on the KILROY WAS HERE cover warns, "By order of
the Majority for Musical Morality, this album contains secret backward
messages..."
Findings: This is a case of second-generation backward-masking. Styx'
PARADISE THEATER did not contain a backward message, though a lot of
people said it did. So Styx has included a sure enough backward
message on KILROY WAS HERE. It is at the very beginning of "Heavy
Metal Poisoning." The reversed speech last about three seconds. There
is no musical background. The words reverse to "Annuit coeptis. Novus
ordo seclorum." This is the Latin motto encircling the pyramid on the
back of a dollar bill. The usual translation: "God has favored our
undertakings. A new order of the ages."
      The cover sticker's "Majority for Musical Morality" is a
fictitious Falwellesque group in the KILROY WAS HERE video. Although
the sticker suggests a plurality of "messages," only one was found.


Space between "I'm So Tired" and "Blackbird"
The Beatles, untitled, a.k.a. THE WHITE ALBUM

Rumor: A reversed message. At the time of the Paul-is-dead stories,
the segue from "I'm So Tired" to "Blackbird" was offered as evidence.
It was held to contain John Lennon's voice, reveresed, saying "Paul is
dead, miss him, miss him, miss him." That interpretation seems
unlikely now, but there is a mysterious low muttering between the
songs.
Findings: The mumbling is actually just to the "I'm So Tired" side of
the shiny "space" between cuts on the record. Each of the stereo
tracks was recorded separately, twice, and a copy of each track was
reversed. This produced four versions of the two-second passage: right
forward, left forward, right reversed, and left reversed. All were
equally unintelligible. It was not even apparent whether the voice is
forward or reversed. Nor could John Lennon be identified as the
speaker. There are nine or ten syllables. The first six (when played
forward) are a two-syllable unit repeated three times. There is little
or no difference betwen the stereo tracks. Any claimed interpretation
of the sounds seems doubtful.


"Strawberry Fields Forever"
The Beatles, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR

Rumor: It was, of course, claimed that John Lennon says "I buried
Paul" at the end. (It's forward, at the very end after the music
fades to complete silence, returns, and starts to fade out again.)
But Lennon told ROLLING STONE that the words are "cranberry
sauce."
Findings: They are "cranberry sauce." The "sauce"/"Paul" part is
indistinct, but the first syllable sounds a lot more like "cran"
than "I."


"Baby You're a Rich Man"
The Beatles, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR

Rumor: On one of the tracks the line "Baby you're a rich man too"
is sung as "Baby you're a rich fag Jew," a dig at Brian Epstein.
Or some think it's "rich fat Jew" and claim it as evidence of
Beatle anti-Semitism.
Findings: Negative. The two stereo tracks are nearly identical.
It's always possible to hear words as similar-sounding words, but
basically, the lyrics jibe with the published version.


"Revolution 9"
The Beatles, untitled, a.k.a. THE WHITE ALBUM

Rumor: Various reversed and/or one-track speech. The reversal of
"Number nine" to "Turn me on, dead man" has pretty much been
discounted as coincidence (though it appears on Congressman
Dornan's list).
Findings: Distinction between lyrics and any hidden message blurs
on "Revolution 9." The eight-minute cut is a montage of sounds
collected by John Lennon and Yoko Ono. It includes discordant
music, radio broadcasts, sirens, applause, gunfights, sports
cheers, the crackling of a fire, screams, a baby gurgling, a choir
singing, and much that cannot be identified. For this
investigation, "Revolution 9" was transcribed four times, twice on
each stereo channel. One copy of each of the tracks was reversed.
The four resulting versions were compared with each other and
against the original two-channel version.
     "Revolution 9" contains a lot of talking. Played in stereo,
forward, the longest stretch of understandable speech is probably
an announcer saying, "...every one of them knew that as time went
by they'd get a little bit older and a little bit slower..."
     One believable instance of reversed speech occurs: someone
saying "Let me out! Let me out!" (once held to represent McCartney
in his totaled Aston-Martin). Two iffy reversals occur on the
backward recording of the right stereo track:"She used to be
assistant" and "There were two men..." Neither is clear enough or
long enough to be convincing. Some of the music, including the
recurring theme, sounds more natural in reverse.
     "Turn me on, dead man" is a typical phonetic reversal. The
forward "number nine" (repeated throughout the cut) is clear; the
reversal is slurred -- something like "turn me on dedmun." It has
been claimed that "number nine" must be pronounced with a British
accent or with some careful inflection in order to reverse to
"Turn me on, dead man." This seems not to be so. As an experiment,
three American-accent renderings of "number nine" were reversed.
All sound about as much like "Turn me on, dead man" as the record
did. Like the other phonetic reversals, "Turn me on, dead man"
must be considered a coincidence.
     Much of "Revolution 9" is on one stereo track only. Near the
end a voice says "A fine natural imbalance...the Watusi...the
twist...Eldorado...Eldorado." "A fine natural imbalance" is on the
right track only, though the words that follow are in stereo. One
of the longer bits of speech -- "Who could tell what he was
saying? His voice was low and his [unintelligible] was high and
his eyes were low" -- is clear on the left track, a bare whisper
on the right.
     There is a stereophonically concealed "secret message" on
"Revolution 9." The words are on the right track. They begin about
four minutes, fifty-eight seconds into the cut and run for about
twenty-two seconds. They are not likely to be noticed in stereo
because of the much louder left track. The sound of applause
begins on the left track at about five minutes, one second into
the cut. Deafening noises -- the clapping, sirens, music --
continue on the left track until five minutes, forty seconds. It
may or may not have been Lennon's and Ono's intention to conceal
the spoken passage. Given the haphazard quality of "Revolution 9,"
the concealment may have been accidental. To recover the passage,
the left track must be switched off. The right track can then be
heard to contain a sound like a stopwatch ticking, behind these
words:

     So the wife called, and we better go to see a
     surgeon....[A SCREAM MUFFLES A LINE THAT SOUNDS LIKE
     Well, what with the prices, the prices have snowballed,
     no wonder it's closed.] ...So any and all, we went to
     see the dentist instead, who gave him a pair of teeth,
     which wasn't any good at all. So instead of that he
     joined the bloody navy and went to sea.
                      by William Poundstone
                              1986

     There really are backward messages on rock albums. And the
controversy over "backward masking" and "porn rock" has inspired a
whole new spate of messages. There may have been more genuine
backward messages in the past few years than ever before.
     The backward message controversy is usually traced to the
1960s and John Lennon's avant-garde sound mixing on such tracks as
"Revolution 9" on the Beatles' WHITE ALBUM. Lennon probably wasn't
trying to conceal a message so much as create an interesting
sound.
     The matter might have ended right there had it not been for
the Paul McCartney death rumor. College kids tried playing Beatles
records forward, backward, and at various speeds to find "clues"
to McCartney's fate. In the process they found snippets of speech
from Lennon's experiments. Even after McCartney was found safe and
sound in Scotland, some listeners continued to look for hidden
messages.
     Somehow, fundamentalist Christian groups became convinced
(ca. 1982) that the alleged messages were commercials for devil
worship. Not a single indisputable satanic message has turned up,
but there were scattered attempts to ban or label certain albums.
In 1986 one fundamentalist group announced that the theme song for
the old MR. ED TV show contains the word "Satan" when played
backward.)
     Ironically, the publicity accorded nonexistent messages has
inspired several artists -- among them porn rock hearing witness
Frank Zappa -- to hide real background messages in their music.
It's easy to do.
     The performer speaks or sings the message normally, then
reverses the tape, which is mixed into the soundtrack. This is all
accomplished simply enough at any recording studio.
     What's not so simple is playing it back. More home record,
cassette, and compact disk players won't play backward. You can
turn a record backward with a pencil eraser, but it's not good for
the needle or the turntable. The only way to reproduce the message
with full fidelity is to use a professional-quality reel-to-reel
tape player and splice the tape in backward.
     We used the facilities of KLOS radio in Los Angeles to
reverse some recent records containing true backward messages.


"Secret Messages"
Electric Light Orchestra, SECRET MESSAGES

ELO's ELDORADO album was among those alleged to contain satanic
backward masked messages. A patient listening to ELDORADO played
backward reveals no such messages. You hear only what you ought to
hear -- the reversed lyrics of the songs, which sound nothing like
the "messages" claimed to be there. In the wake of such
allegations, ELO did put an (innocuous) backward message on their
FACE THE MUSIC album. Perhaps they thought this would show how
silly the allegations were. Instead, the backward-masking people
seized on this as proof that the other "messages" were real. In
the latest volley, ELO has named an album after the controversy.
     In Britain (where the backward-masking issue is viewed as an
American eccentricity), the cover of SECRET MESSAGES has a mock
warning label to youth about the hidden label. Word of the albums'
impending release in the United States caused enough of a furor to
chill CBS Records into deleting the cover blurb.
     The reversed message is easy to find. It's at the beginning
of the first song, which is itself called "Secret Messages." You
can hear reversed speech when you play the record normally. A
voice intones "secret messages" -- forward -- in the middle of the
reversed speech, lest anyone dare be so unhip as to not know
what's going on.
     We transferred a new copy of SECRET MESSAGES to reel-to-reel
tapes and played it backward. The backward message goes: "WELCOME
TO THE BIG SHOW/ WELCOME TO THE BIG SHOW."
     That's it.


"Ya Hozna"
Frank Zappa, THEM OR US

"Ya Hozna," a six-minute composition on the first record of the
THEM OR US double album, is ENTIRELY backward. The albums' inner
cover, which includes lyrics for the other songs, says, "backwards
vocal -- you figure it out" of this cut. It credits Frank and Moon
Zappa, George Duke, and Napoleon Murphy Brock as vocalists.
     Played forward, "Ya Howza" sounds like a record played
backward -- reasonably so. The vocals are prominent and
unintelligible. Moon Zappa's voice is curiously recognizable, even
in reverse. It is hard to tell whether the music was recorded
forward or backward.
     When "Ya Howza" is played in reverse, you discover that the
music is virtually a palindrome -- it sounds about the same
forward and backward. The voices are all backward. In some cases
they have been modified electronically. Many of the words are
muffled. Even after repeated careful listening on both stereo
tracks, it is difficult to make out many of the lyrics. It doesn't
help that some of the words seem to be stream-of-consciousness
nonsense. Some of the unintelligible stuff sounds like opera.
     Starting at the beginning of the reversed tape -- the end of
the forward tape -- the clearer vocals go like this: "I am the
heaven, I am the water." This is in a hymnlike register. "You are
a lonely little girl./ But your mommy and your daddy hold you." A
singsong synthesizer voice.
     The most interesting part of the lyrics is an intermittently
orgasmic rap in Moon Zappa's Valley Girl voice. There are three
short monologues:

I'm like green!
I'm like squat!
I'm like soul!
Repeat, like soul!
I'm like pull, push,
Okay, like slow, slow.

You're never too old
Like slow, like slow, like slow
Okay, I like it.


All right, faster, faster,
Go, do it, do it twice,
Yeah, that feels good,
I'm looking great,
Yeah, fer shure!
Like, no way!


"No Anchovies, Please"
J. Geils Band, LOVE STINKS

"No Anchovies, Please" is a novelty song, really a narration with
sound effects, about a woman who is kidnapped after eating
anchovies. She is taken to a "foreign-speaking" country. The sound
effect of the foreign tongue seems reversed. When you do play it
in reverse, it becomes: "It doesn't take a genius to know the
difference between chicken shit and chicken salad."


"Darling Nikki"
Prince, PURPLE RAIN

"Darling Nikki," cited as porn rock before Congress, is about a
dominatrix in a hotel lobby masturbating with a magazine. In part,
the complaint was that the album cover (flowers, and Prince on a
motorcycle) wasn't explicit enough to warn kids of the suggestive
lyrics. Senator Paula Hawkins apparently was not aware of a
backward message hidden in "Darling Nikki." The last thirty-five
seconds of the song is gibberish. The music changes abruptly and
becomes a repeated glottal sound. Then a two-syllable sound is
repeated twice, something like "heaven, heaven." Unintelligible
speech follows. At the end is a sound reminiscent of rain or bacon
frying , and wind sounds.
     Played backward, the message becomes:

     Hello, how are you?
     I'm fine 'cause I know that the Lord is coming soon.
     Coming, coming soon.

     It is clearly Prince and the Revolution singing this. The
words are clear but the intonation is funny -- the linger on some
words. Perhaps this is to make the reversed message you hear
playing the record normally a little less conspicuous.
     This is a weird reversal of the supposed secret message
menace. Raunchy forward lyrics conceal a religious secret message.


"Judas Kiss"
Petra, MORE POWER TO YOU

Petra is an obscure group that sings religious songs to a rock
beat. As further proof that things have gone full circle, the
backward-masking controversy prompted Petra to include a wholesome
backward message on their MORE POWER TO YOU album. It is in the
transition between two songs, just before "Judas Kiss." Clearly
audible gibberish reverses to this (the husky voice a cross
between George Beverly Shea and Dee Snider): "What are you looking
for the Devil for, when you ought to be looking for the Lord?"

AFL JoyceM Welcome to the Apple II Music & Sound chat - our discussion will
           be on NoiseTracker - the new FTA music program for the GS.  AFA
           Gene will be our host this evening...Gene, the floor is yours :)

AFA Gene   Hi all... well first I'd like to point out, if y'all aren't aware
           yet, that a spanking new version of NoiseTracker has recently
           been released (9 days ago) and is now available in our New Files
           library. It is version 0.5. I haven't played around with it much
           yet, but it's supposed to fix a lot of the little bugs in 0.3
           (the first version we had online).  NoiseTracker also includes
           the ability to directly import "modules," a term used for a
           certain type of Amiga song file which has become popular among PC
           users using the SoundBlaster sound card.

           Now, via NT, these "MOD" files are accessible by the GS. We
           expect to see a lot of activity on this end as far as ports from
           the PC and Amiga go. Note that you should be able to go straight
           to the PC music forum and download any recently uploaded MOD
           songfiles (there was a bug in the first wide release of the PCAO
           software, however, so a bunch of files with dates between around
           March 1991 and September 1991 may not download properly. Note that
           to use these PC MOD files, you'll have to rename the downloaded
           file "MOD.xxxxxx" if you want it to show up automatically in NT's
           "open" dialog box. (On the PC, all MOD files are named
           "xxxxxxxx.MOD" instead.)   Also, if the files are packed with ZIP
           compression, you'll need a program from the Communications Forum
           called AGATE -- it's a terminal program that includes the ability
           to unpack ZIP files.

           Now, I guess the best thing to do would be to talk about our
           favorite songfiles... there have been a few complaints, in fact,
           that people were not being "descriptive" enough in their file
           descriptions for uploads in describing the songs.

AFC Eddie  ?

AFA Gene   GA ed

AFC Eddie  Once a MOD file is unpacked with Agate, is a file type change
           needed?

AFA Gene   Nope, since all that NT looks for is the "MOD." being the first
           four characters in the filename.

AFC Eddie  OK, Thanks!

Deanna7332 Question...

JonL7      Can you list some of the features of Noisetracker?

AFA Gene   (you don't even need that "MOD." if you want to type the name in
           directly.)

Deanna7332 Did any of these mod files have anything to do with FTA's "Module
           A"

AFA Gene   Sure Jon, right after we answer Deanna's question. Deanna, you
           mean "Modulae?"

Deanna7332 Yes, that's it.

AFA Gene   Modulae was a demo written by FTA last year. (i'll get to you in a
           sec Doors).  It used SoundSmith v0.95 for all it's music. There
           is no connection between MOD files and Modulae by FTA.

Deanna7332 Throughout the demo it said "Loading modules"

AFA Gene   Those "modules" are not the same as Amiga soundfile "modules" --
           you see, what Modulae really was was a "stringing together" of a
           bunch of neat little tiny demos that FTA had written. So they
           called each little demo a "module" and thus the entire demo as a
           whole, "Modulae" (fancy plural of module?)

Deanna7332 Ok I understand.  Thank you. :)

AFL JoyceM Latin, Gene :)

AFA Gene   The term "MODule" from the Amiga comes from the idea that all the
           stuff needed to play the songfile (all the instruments + the
           sequence file) are included into one file, the "module."

TheDoors1  Gene, I have tried to d/l some recent uploaded MODs in the PC
           music area and still the problem exists.

AFA Gene   As I understand it, the problem was fixed VERY recently (correct
           me on this Joyce) and files uploaded as recently as early
           November still might not work depending on the version of the
           PCAO software that the uploader used.

AFL JoyceM Actually, Gene...I was under the impression that it had been, but
           if Doors is still having a problem, then it must not be fixed.

AFA Gene   What date was the file you tried to d/l, Door?

TheDoors1  umm 11/17, around there

AFA Gene   hmmm.... well i can tell you one thing... if it didn't work, don't
           waste your time again later... the problem is in the Apple
           software's method of d/lling files, and there are no plans to
           upgrade the Apple AO software.

AFL JoyceM I will endeavor to get an answer to that PC downloading
           problem/question :)

ThomasK63  i have a quick question... what can you use to unpack amiga mod
           files? On the PC side, that is.

TheDoors1  Agate Thomas

ELECTMUSIC Doors... what happens on after downloading..

Deanna7332 If it's LZHed you can't unless you have an IBM or
           PC/Transporter.

AFA Gene   If GS-ShrinkIt doesn't have that ability, i don't think there
           exists any such utility on the GS.

TheDoors1  What do you mean Elect?

ELECTMUSIC After you download the file... where do you encounter a problem?

TheDoors1  ok, you know when you download the file and at some point in the
           download the file starts to appear on your screen.  That's when I
           cancel it.

ThomasK63  I am sure soething good can be made w/out resorting to Amiga
           files

AFC Eddie  Yes, Doors, I believe the problem is with the PC software it was
           UL'd with.

TheDoors1  yeah Eddie.

GNO Tim    Amiga MOD files are typically compressed using LHarc.  I've
           uncompressed several on my Unix machine at school.

ThomasK63  good time for someone to make a lharc unpacker...

AFC DYAJim someone might be ;)

GNO Tim    Several people are already

AFC Eddie  Can't wait, Jim!

AFA Gene   Jon, did you have a question?

JonL7      The features of Noisetracker :)

AFA Gene   Oh yes... okay, here goes, in a nutshell, from most important to
           least:


AFA Gene   *  ability to import MOD files

           *  ability to import Soundsmith files

           *  ProDOS 8 based

           *  virtually no editing abilities (not a feature but important to
           know)

AFC DYAJim :)

AFA Gene   *  forgot: and the most important feature of all, the ability to
           hold instrument files in regular system RAM instead of DOC RAM,
           allowing for instruments far beyond the regular 64K limit found
           in ALL other GS music programs.

ThomasK63  I'll buy that!

TheDoors1  I have another question...when you're ready.

AFA Gene   GA Doors

TheDoors1  ok..is it true that NoiseTracker will take in soundsmith files and
           play them more clearly

AFA Gene   Well, as far as "what you hear," yes there is a definite
           difference with some instruments. It does NOT play the sounds
           more "clearly," but it just plays them in a different way. What
           many people seem to like about this "different way" is that
           sustained instruments (i.e. instruments designed to be played
           in a loop to simulate a long held note) seem to work better (or
           perhaps simply the way they were originally intended to work).

TheDoors1  I see

Deanna7332 Which takes up more space - MOD or NT  w/soundfile ?

AFA Gene   Deanna, it depends a few things, such as how big the sequence is,
           how many instruments you have, etc. Once you have a lot of
           assorted files, it'll probably average out to be about the same
           give or take a hundred blocks on your HD. So it basically depends
           on whether you prefer to have your instruments separate or not.

Deanna7332 Does playing quality differ with either one ?

AFA Gene   Nope. It's exactly the same either way. Loading time is the same
           too.

AFC Eddie  Can NT save songs as MOD files?

AFA Gene   Nope. It has options for Open and Close module, but these are
           still inactive.

AFA Gene   If there are no more questions, I'd like to talk about which NT
           files out there are the "hottest," since this info could be
           useful to many users who are interested in downloading NT/MOD
           files.

           My personal favorite is "Lambada," which is supplied by FTA with
           the program but is available separately on America
           Online.Everything about this file is really impressive except
           perhaps the sound quality of the horn-ish melody instrument.

           What about y'all, what are your favorite NT files?

AFL JoyceM Gene, there is a classical song for NT, but can't remember the
           name, but it is good.

AFC Eddie  I like Dragnet!

ELECTMUSIC So do I Ed

TheDoors1  I like Seven something

Deanna7332 My most favorite of all mod files is Pleasure Principle

AFC Eddie  <--appreciate's Greg's taste!

AFL JoyceM :)

AFA Gene   Deanna, i assume you got that from a local board?

Deanna7332 I got it from the PC forum here.

TheDoors1  I saw it there also

Deanna7332 I think under "Pleasure"

AFA Gene   Would you be able to upload it here? If it's really that good, we
           ought to have it available directly in our oun NT lib here (BTW
           folks, we will be releasing a new NoiseTracker software library
           soon!)

AFC Eddie  What a Forum!!!

Deanna7332 That sounds great!

AFL JoyceM Gene, do you think it will be possible for synthLAB files to be
           converted to MOD files?

AFL JoyceM MOD files?

AFA Gene   I doubt it, Joyce. The formats are so diametrically opposed in
           their entire basis of their file formats that it wouldn't be
           worth the time for a programmer to develop such a convertor.

Deanna7332 Isn't it possible to move the mod file from the PC forum to our
           music library?

AFA Gene   But..... it might be worth the time for a MIDI File Format to MOD
           convertor, since these two formats are more widely accepted.

Nuzz       they have nothing better to do Gene

ELECTMUSIC Gene.. some interesting similarities with DTune and NTracker

AFA Gene   They lose the file, tho, Deanna. :)

AFL JoyceM In what way, Greg?

ELECTMUSIC Both Prodos 8

Deanna7332 Shhh they won't know a thing :)

ELECTMUSIC I also believe Bill uses a shuttling of sound data between Doc
           Ram and Ram.

AFC Eddie  Interesting, Greg.

ELECTMUSIC Thats how he gets some of the excellent instrument quality

AFC Eddie  But Diversitune has that one distinction:  MIDI input.

AFL JoyceM Deanna, we would greatly appreciate it if you would upload that
           'Pleasure' song to our library :)

ELECTMUSIC Agreed Ed.. one of the factors FTA doesn't like to incorporate
           into their programs.

Deanna7332 I'll u/l it tonight if possible.

AFL JoyceM Thanks :)

AFC Eddie  Thanks, Deanna!

AFL JoyceM I will send Bill B a copy of NoiseTracker + some MOD files...to
           see what comments we get from him (will send when I get back).

AFC DYAJim What ever happened to that diversitune upgrade that was talked
           about ?

ELECTMUSIC That would be interesting Joyce

AFC Eddie  Bill apparently still working on it, Jim.

ELECTMUSIC I am sure he would appreciate the Prodos 8

AFC DYAJim good..

AFL JoyceM Jim...RSN....he was hoping by Christmas (this year), but he is
           soooo busy with his job, who knows?

AFC DYAJim Oh yeah, I noticed the speed calcuation in NT .5 is inaccurate
           :)

AFC DYAJim I recall he has set a lot of Christmas projected dates :)

ELECTMUSIC He was one of the first "Free Tools" experts in breaking all the
           rules for economic sake.

AFC DYAJim like for the vaporware DT inst editor like 2 years ago.

Deanna7332 Are there any Christmas Mod or NT songs?

AFC Eddie  Oh yeah, Diversi-Editor!

AFL JoyceM I know, Jim - but that I know he has been working on.

AFC DYAJim he projected Christmas for it, and it never came :)

AFA Gene   Not yet in AMS, but hopefully the Holiday Contest will change all
           that. :)

AFC DYAJim I look foreward to any upgrades..

AFL JoyceM Not that I am aware of Deanna - you have some?  hint, hint

Deanna7332 Nope sorry.  I was hoping there were some that could be u/led
           here

AFC DYAJim I'll be breaking out the xmas tune book rsn.. I should be able to
           midi a few :) (which rules out nt)

AFL JoyceM Question...

AFC Eddie  It would be more appropriate to have a converter from Appleworks
           spreadsheet to MOD than from MIDI!

AFL JoyceM If I got ahold of an Amiga song (MOD) disk...how would I convert
           them for here?

AFA Gene   You mean an Amiga-formatted disk?

AFL JoyceM Yes

AFC DYAJim Ack.. methinks you need an amiga and a null modem cable or a
           modem.

AFA Gene   Methinks Jim is right

AFC DYAJim LOL!!  Design your music in the spreadsheet then import to NT :)
           IT might actually have better editing?!! :)

AFC Eddie  Right!

AFL JoyceM Me thinks he is right.  If I had them upload to me, would that
           work?

AFA Gene   Yep; should work like a charm.

AFC DYAJim Yah.. as long as they're coming from an amiga

AFL JoyceM Great....I will work on that when I get back  (making note now).

AFL JoyceM Gene, will you get some of those files (NT) sent to that area
           tonight?  If so, I will leave the needed message :)

AFA Gene   That's all I have planned for tonight's chat, Joyce. Yep, I'll
           move some files right now.

AFL JoyceM Thanks...

AFL JoyceM Then we should have our NoiseTracker Library by end of the week in
           AMS :)

ELECTMUSIC Gene... quick question:  Are you launching NTracker from a 3.5
           disk?

AFL JoyceM Okay, guys...I will see you all the week of December 11th (may the
           4th) as I am off on vacation.

AFA Gene   Yep greg

AFC JohnC  Where are you going?

ELECTMUSIC Do you encounter out of memory problems

AFL JoyceM Night all...and Gene, thanks for an excellent chat and great
           explanations of NoiseTracker.

Nuzz       Joyce, I have good news for FutureSound owners. SoundConvert will
           support it in the first release

AFC Eddie  Great, Mike!

AFA Gene   Greg, i always keep my RAMdisk at 0 when using noisetracker. Not
           only are

AFC JohnC  Mike...SoundConvert...released?

AFL JoyceM Great, Mike.  When can we get SoundConvert, Mike? and FutureSound
           :)

AFA Gene   there a couple of bugs with memory management, but if you're
           loading in a MOD file that's really big, NT will eat your RAMdisk.

AFC Eddie  Sounds good.

Nuzz       The manual is being "layout". Release date should be about 1st
           week of Dec

ELECTMUSIC Tnxs Gene

AFC JohnC  YES.......WTG Nuzz!!!!!!!!

Deanna7332 Yes, why is there on some MOD files a stop somewhere in the middle
           ?

Deanna7332 That's really frustrating!

AFL JoyceM Mike, leave me E-Mail on when and how I can send your the $$ to
           get it.

AFL JoyceM Again...night all

Nuzz       gee John, I had to do something to explain the delay :)

ELECTMUSIC Thanks Gene for a GREAT chat!

AFC Eddie  Yes, Gene!  Great!

AFA Gene   Thanks Greg, 'night!

AFA Gene   thanx, see y'all later :)

Copyright 1987 Bob Szekely.

    John Michael Osbourne, (known as "Ozzy" to his fans), has in his long 
career as vocalist for Black Sabbath had his work with the group misconstrued 
as advocating Satanism.  In a 1983 radio special featuring Ozzy, the 
interviewer expressed precisely this point; "...Ozzy has always been shrouded 
in the darkest of Satanic imagery.  Yet if you really listen to his music, 
you'll find that what he is saying differs greatly from his image...."(1)  Even 
the group's image has often been described as "occult and diabolic".(2)

    The important point to remember here is to differentiate between appearance 
and reality.  Although the name "Black Sabbath" conjures up images of witches 
and sorcerers paying homage to Satan for the powers bestowed upon them, this 
does not make it safe to assume that the group that went by this name 
necessarily drew the inspiration from the occult.(3)  The closest they ever 
came to it was a gothic horror film featuring Boris Karloff as narrator; they 
adopted their name directly from the name of this film.(4)  Black Sabbath was 
involved in the black arts as much as Karloff practiced casting spells off-
screen.  Tony Iommi, the group's guitarist, summed it up best when he described 
the group as having basically "...the same appeal as a horror movie.  It's all 
an act."(5)










    Just as their film counterpart did, Ozzy and Sabbath found the occult 
mythos to be an effective vehicle for powerful social commentary; particularly 
when put in the context of heavy-metal rock and roll.  Ozzy himself noted that 
there are "...people who pick up my [album] cover[s] and go...'This guy's got 
to be singing about Devil, doom, death and destruction.'  Which is not the 
case...."(6)

    The late Lester Bangs likened the group to Bob Dylan and William Burroughs, 
describing them all as "...moralists...trying to deal with a serious present 
situation in an honest way...."(7)  Ozzy and Black Sabbath merely bring to 
light the many evils of our world in their work, to try and make us realize 
that we are all victim to their influence.  They hope to make us recognize 
these evils so that we may take up arms against them; a point Ozzy emphatically 
stresses:  "...one thing everybody has got to understand about Black Sabbath's 
lyrics.  They're not downer lyrics, they're just telling everybody where it's 
at..."(8)  He also cites the group's most controversial tune, "Black Sabbath", 
as a response to the ignorant hippie culture still force when the tune was 
written in 1970:  "The hippies said: 'The world is beautiful man.' (sic)  You 
only had to look around you to see how crappy it was.  It was ridiculous 
listening to that stuff, let alone playing it, so we just wrote about the world 
the way it really was and how it affected us - and we felt better in ourselves 
because we were really being honest...."(9)

    I   1   HAVE YOU EVER THOUGH ABOUT YOUR SOUL-
        2   CAN IT BE SAVED?
        3   OR PERHAPS YOU THINK THAT WHEN YOU ARE DEAD
        4   YOU JUST STAY IN YOUR GRAVE.
        5   IS GOD JUST A THOUGHT WITHIN YOUR HEAD OR IS
        6   HE A PART OF YOU?
        7   IS CHRIST JUST A NAME THAT YOU READ IN A BOOK
        8   WHEN YOU WERE AT SCHOOL?

    II  9   WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT DEATH DO YOU LOSE
        10  YOUR BREATH OR DO YOU KEEP YOUR COOL?
        11  WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE THE POPE ON THE END
        12  OF A ROPE - DO YOU THINK HE'S A FOOL?
        13  WELL I'VE SEEN THE TRUTH - YES I'VE SEEN 
        14  THE LIGHT AND I'VE CHANGED MY WAYS.
        15  AND I'LL BE PREPARED WHEN YOU'RE LONELY 
        16  AND SCARED AT THE END OF OUR DAYS.

    III 17  COULD IT BE YOU'RE AFRAID OF WHAT YOU'R
        18  FRIENDS MIGHT SAY 
        19  IF THEY NEW YOU BELIEVED IN GOD ABOVE
        20  THEY SHOULD REALISE BEFORE THE CRITICISE
        21  THAT GOD IS THE ONLY WAY TO LOVE.

    IV  23  IS YOUR MIND SO SMALL THAT YOU HAVE TO FALL
        24 IN WITH THE PACK WHEREVER THEY RUN
        25  WILL YOU STILL SNEER WHEN DEATH IS NEAR
        26  AND SAY THEY MAY AS WELL WORSHIP THE SUN.

    V   27  I THINK IT WAS TRUE IT WAS PEOPLE LIKE YOU
        28  THAT CRUCIFIED CHRIST
        29  I THINK IT IS SAD THE OPINION YOU HADE WAS THE
        30  ONLY ONE VOICED.
        31  WILL YOU BE SO SURE WHEN YOUR DAY IS NEAR
        32  SAY YOU DON'T BELIEVE?
        33  YOU HAD THE CHANCE BUT YOU TURNED IT DOWN
        34  NOW YOU CAN'T RETRIEVE.










    VI  35  PERHAPS YOU'LL THINK BEFORE YOU SAY THAT
        36  GOD IS DEAD AND GONE
        37  OPEN YOUR EYES, JUST REALIZE THAT HE IS THE
        38  ONE.
        39  THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN SAVE YOU KNOW FROM
        40  ALL THIS SIN AND HATE.
        41  OR WILL YOU STILL JEER AT ALL YOU HEAR?
        42  YES!-I THINK IT'S TOO LATE.

    In this piece, the group asserts a belief in an afterlife and spiritual 
redemption.  As grisly as the image of a hanged pontiff is, its shock value is 
a necessary part of the message:  They reject religious dogma, stating that a 
belief in God, in one's own heart, is the only guiding light to help one inn 
his life (lines 11/12, 39/40).  Furthermore, the reject religious hypocrisy 
(lines 5/6, 7/8) and peer pressure (verses III, IV) as excuses for not 
accepting God.  To clarify further:  following the crowd does not justify 
shrugging responsibility for one's own actions.

    After re-reading, it becomes obvious that this song is an ascerbic critique 
of atheism; (line 35/36) I refer here again to verses three and four.  In these 
two verses, the picture painted in one of Godless conformity and how it's 
viewed as being as foolish as Paganism.  These lyrics set an example for the 
listener by relating personal experience (lines 13-16).  However, for those who 
cannot accept this the group has no recourse but to condemn them, although 
rather ironically; they hope that their rhetorical loss of faith in the 
listener will open his eyes (line 42).










                           B L A C K   S A B B A T H 



            WHAT IS THIS, THAT STANDS BEFORE ME?
            FIGURE IN BLACK, WHICH POINTS AT ME
            TURN ROUND QUICK AND START TO RUN
            FIND OUT I'M THE CHOSEN ONE.  OH, NO!
            
            BIG BLACK SHAPE WITH EYES OF FIRE
            TELLING PEOPLE THEIR DESIRE
            SATAN'S SITTING THERE, HE'S SMILING
            WATCHES THOSE FLAMES GET HIGHER AND HIGHER
            OH, NO, NO, -- PLEASE GOD HELP ME!
            
                IS THIS THE END MY FRIEND?
                SATAN'S COMING 'ROUND THE BEND
                PEOPLE RUNNING 'CAUSE THEY'RE SCARED
                THE PEOPLE BETTER GO AND BEWARE
                NO, NO!  PLEASE--NO!!
                
                
    The all time controversy winner!  Is this not irrefutably  THE song about 
Black Magic in rock?  It's all so obvious, suffuse with evil imagery; Satan, 
walls of flame, figure in black, and damnation at the end.  Yes, I see the 
images too; it definitely concerns Black Magic.  Then again, Shakespeare's 
Macbeth employed scenes of witches involved in conjurations; does that mean 
that Shakespeare was a warlock?  Poe used to write sardonic tragedies about 
twisted murderers and the bizarre nature of acts, did that make him an evil, 
leering, demented killer?  Did either of them advocated what they wrote about?  
One has to remember that writing about something is not necessarily the same as 
emulating it.  Tony Iommi spoke out quite strongly about this:  "People are 
bringing us down saying that we are a Black Magic group.  I think they must be










getting mixed up with Black Widow.  We don't do any sacrifices on stage, and 
we're not on a black magic kick.  We wanted to do heavy numbers and the guitar 
riffs we worked out were more suited to evil things than love.  We play songs 
about black magic, but they are more likely to be against than for it."(12)  

    By now, you're probably asking yourself who Black Widow is, right?  Then 
it's time for a little history:

        Sabbath, before they were known as Sabbath, had the same line-up but 
two earlier names.  The first one was Polka Tulk, which seemed sure to doom 
them to obscurity.(13)  The soon realized this and changed the group's name to 
Earth.  Now, Earth was a blues band at the end of the English blues boom.  As 
if that wasn't bad enough, they soon discovered that not only was there another 
group named Earth, but they had also released a single.  To avoid confusion, 
they changed their name again.(14)  But what made them decide on that name?  
Just ask Ozzy:  "I just liked the name Black Sabbath because of the succession 
of vowel sounds.(15)  If that sounds ludicrous just consider this:  Sabbath was 
"...the first of the really committed, loud and heavy bands..."(16)  They 
needed a name to match the gut-wrenching power they were developing.  Tony knew 
that he wanted Sabbath to be noticed above all the rest of the British blues 
bands:  "We wanted something of our own that we'd like and people would like.  
And we wanted something loud!"










    Tony didn't hate the blues.  He'd cut his teeth as a guitarist on the likes 
of The Shadows, Buddy Holly and Django Rheinhardt, developing his own style 
from there.  But he realized the group had no future in the blues:

        'We couldn't keep playing 12-bars forever.  We just got fed up with 
Earth music.  It was jazz, blues stuff.  It was good for practice but nothing 
else.'

    In the late 'Sixties, blues groups were a dime a dozen in Birmingham and 
interest was waning in the blues boom due to the glut of groups.  One man, by 
the name of Jim Simpson, had heard Earth around the Birmingham club circuit and 
understood what they were trying to do.  He decided to take them under his 
wing.  With the aid of his massive record collection, Jim expanded the group's 
horizons in the areas of jazz and blues.  He introduced them to artists like 
Wes Montgomery, Count Basie and Jimmy Rushing.  It was from Rushing in 
particular that they derived the repetitive riff style so readily noticeable in 
their later incarnation as Black Sabbath.

    The Count Basie influence is evidenced in the song "Wicked World" from the 
first album; Sabbath drummer Bill Ward uses a "'sighing hi-hat'...in the manner 
of Basie's drummer Jo Jones."










    The influence is subtle, almost subliminal.  Yet it is one which was not 
thought capable of hard, 'heavy' rock bands in the late 'Sixties.  Although Led 
Zeppelin and Jimi Hendrix also had their work steeped in blues and jazz 
derivations (Hendrix' "Third Stone From the Sun" and Zeppelin's version of 
Willie Dixon's "I Can't Quit You Baby" from their first album), neither was 
able to match the intense energy of Black Sabbath.  Iommi has always had a 
preference for music with an original, distinct style of its' own; as an 
example, he mentions guitarists Joe Pass and Alvin Lee as two of his strongest 
songwriting influences.

    It would also be necessary that Sabbath develop a unique, distinctive style 
and image of their own.  Though they had changed their name from Earth to Black 
Sabbath to avoid confusion with the other Earth; at the same time another group 
emerged by the name of Black Widow "...who WERE profoundly influenced by the 
occult, had a male witch as a patron, and wrote pieces like "Come to The 
Sabbat."  Unfortunately, Sabbath was constantly reaping the benefits of Widow's 
publicity.

    Sabbath was a group that never minced words.  If they saw something as 
destructive, they would be sure to rub the listener's face it it.  They did not 
want their point to be missed.

    With their straightforward, sometimes brutal way of looking at things, they 
try to shock the listener's conscience back into awareness.  The imagery of 
"Hand of Doom", from the Paranoid album, is candid and condemning; it is a 
strong statement against drug addiction and rightly so...

            CAUSED BY DEADLY PIN
            
            HEAD STARTS SPINNING 'ROUND
            FALL DOWN TO THE GROUND
            FEEL YOUR BODY HEAVE
            DEATH'S HANDS START TO WEAVE
            
            IT'S TO LATE TOO TURN
            YOU DON'T WANNA LEARN
            PRICE OF LIFE YOU CRY
            NOW YOU'RE GONNA DIE
            
            
    Many people felt the group's overall direction was pessimistic and had a 
negative effect on its listener's due to that.  "Ozzy insisted that if people 
thought he was having a bad effect on the minds of young kids, they should go 
and watch the TV news where real murder and mayhem were a way of life, and 
shown night after night." (18)

    Sabbath was never negative in their message; they were simply truthful 
about waht they saw as wrong in the world.  If you "Strip away the horror 
stories, the imagery and the hysteria, (and) turn down the amps a notch...you 
have a well-rehearsed, solid blues and rock band, powered by a dedication to 
well defined objectives."  On the top of the list of those objectives was 
truth; Sabbath never feared facing that truth squarely, regardless of what many 
people thought of them.

Long, long, time ago,
I can still remember,
When the local calls were "free".
And I knew if I paid my bill,
And never wished them any ill,
That the phone company would let me be...

But Uncle Sam said he knew better,
Split 'em up, for all and ever!
We'll foster competition:
It's good capital-ism!

I can't remember if I cried,
When my phone bill first tripled in size.
But something touched me deep inside,
The day... Bell System... died.

And we were singing...

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
"Our local calls have us in hock!" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

Is your office Step by Step,
Or have you gotten some Crossbar yet?
Everybody used to ask...
Oh, is TSPS coming soon?
IDDD will be a boon!
And, I hope to get a Touch-Tone phone, real soon...

The color phones are really neat,
And direct dialing can't be beat!
My area code is "low":
The prestige way to go!

Oh, they just raised phone booths to a dime!
Well, I suppose it's about time.
I remember how the payphones chimed,
The day... Bell System... died.

And we were singing...

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
"Our local calls have us in hock!" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

Back then we were all at one rate,
Phone installs didn't cause debate,
About who'd put which wire where...
Installers came right out to you,
No "phone stores" with their ballyhoo,
And 411 was free, seemed very fair!

But FCC wanted it seems,
To let others skim long-distance creams,
No matter 'bout the locals,
They're mostly all just yokels!

And so one day it came to pass,
That the great Bell System did collapse,
In rubble now, we all do mass,
The day... Bell System... died.

So bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
"Our local calls have us in hock!" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

I drove on out to Murray Hill,
To see Bell Labs, some time to kill,
But the sign there said the Labs were gone.
I went back to my old CO,
Where I'd had my phone lines, years ago,
But it was empty, dark, and ever so forlorn...

No relays pulsed,
No data crooned,
No MF tones did play their tunes,
There wasn't a word spoken,
All carrier paths were broken...

And so that's how it all occurred,
Microwave horns just nests for birds,
Everything became so absurd,
The day... Bell System... died.

So bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
"Our local calls have us in hock!" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

We were singing:

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
"Our local calls have us in hock!" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?

I hear Valkyries a-comin                There are people into Voodoo
In the air their song is comin          there are people into Voodoo

Here's to those who copy Conan    There will be a lot of lovin
Here's to those who copy Conan    when we're meetin in our Coven
They're just Followers of Onan    Quit yer pushin and yer shovin
and that's good enough for me!    So there's room enough for me!

We will have a mighty Party           It was good enough for Sappho
In the honor of Astarte               With her lady on her lap-o
Grab your chiton - don't be tardy     She put Lesbos on the map-o
'Cause she's good enough for me!      With her pagan poetry!

Shall we sing a verse for Venus,    Well the Christians all are humming
Of the Gods she is the meanest,     Cause they say their God is coming,
Cause she bit me on my...elbow      Our God came three times this evening
And it's good enough for me.        And that's good enough for me.

We will worship like the Druids,      Some guys have a circumcision
Drinking strange fermented fluids,    On account of their religion,
Running naked through the woo-ids,    An embarrassing incision
Coz that's good enough for me.        Cut just ENOUGH from me!   

We will sing a verse for Loki       It was good for old Jehovah
He's the old Norse god of Chaos     He had a son who was a nova!
Which is why this verse don't       Hey there, Mithras! Move on ova'!
       rhyme or scan or nothin'     Another resurrection Day!
But it's good enough for me...

It was good for Thor and Odin       It could be that you're a Parsi

We will sing to Lady Isis           We will all bow down to Dagon

There are those who, when they've got e-
Normous problems that are knotty
They just take them to Hecate         Thanks to great Quetzacoatl
And that's good enough for me!        And his sacred axolotl
                                      And his gift of chocolatl
Was a time, so I've heard tell, a     And please pass some down to me!

And that's good enough for me!        But that's good enough for me!

Let us sing the praise of Horus    We went off to worship Venus
As our fathers did before us       By the Gods! You should have seen us!
We're the New Egyptian Chorus      Now the Clinic has to screen us...
And we sing in harmony!            But that's good enough for me!

Montezuma liked to start out             There's that lusty old Priapus 
Rites by carrying a part out             He's just itching to unwrap us.

We will all bow down to Allah     Where's the gong gone? I can't find it

I was singing Hari Rama              We will pray with those Egyptians
With my friend the Dalai Lama        Build pyramids to put our crypts in

But that's good enough for me        which is good enough for me.....!

One-eyed Odin we will follow      We will pray to Zarathustra
And in fighting we will wallow    And we'll pray just like we usta

Which is good enough for me!      And that's good enough for me!

Hare Krishna gets a laugh on         I'll arise at early mornin'

We will sing a verse for Eris           Of Great Murphy much is spoken
(Golden apples for the fairest!)        For his Law shall not be broken

We will sing for great Diana         If your god of choice is Squat
Who will teach of love and honor     Well then trendy, man, you're not -

I'll sing some songs to Lilith,      Now Danae was sweet as flowers,

but She's good enough for me!        And that's good enough for me!       
 
And what about this Bacchus,         Diana is a little spikey
Who lives just to raise a ruckus?    And she is a little dyke-ey

Well, that's good enough for me!     To know that's right for me!

Lilith wears a lacy nightie        That Bob Larson shrieks and hollers
And She is a little flighty        Fighting demons in his callers

She's wet-dream enough for me!     And that's good enough for me.

With the aid of my athame           Well I'm tired of Ronald Reagan,

We will worship with the Fundies       L. Ron Hubbard liked precision

We will worship Holy Ford              We will worship with the witches

And that's good enough for me.       So he's good enough for me.

We will sing of Iluvatur,             We will sing of Foul the Render,
Who sent the Valar 'cross the water   Who's got Drool Rockworm on a bender
To lead Morgoth to the slaughter      In his cave in Kiril Threndor--
And that's just fine with me.         They're both too much for me.

   Then perhaps she'd deign to talk to me!            

   Lady Trude thought it her duty
   To turn a social wrong into a Right
   Proved her point with Imperium Compound
   And showed that Cheshire Cats can fight!  //and scratch//

   The Board of Directors styled themselves The Electors
   And another con they tried to swing
   Now the BoD drinks Imperium Compound
   So we no longer need a King!                        

   AltChorus: Oh the Bod, the BoD, the BoD,
              It thinks it is God, is God, is God,
              The figure of Supreme Authority!
              And if we O.D.'d on Imperium Compund
              there'd be no need for Royalty!          

   Oh, MEDIEVAL Net, we thought it was all wet
   With witty remarks, and other kinds of sass
   We'll feed our computers on Imperium Compound
   And BYTE the BoD right on its' righteous ass!         

   Good old Duncan was often drunken
   Chasing all the ladies fair
   He bathed himself in Imperium Compound
   Now he has a little savoir faire!

  ATEN IMPERIUM (cont.)

   Ioseph of Locksley, never changes his socks, he
   Runs around looking like a Cavalier,
   He stocked up on Imperium Compound
   And he has enough to last for years and years!        

   AltChorus: Oh they forgot, forgot, forgot
              The Locks-e-ly Plot, the Plot, the Plot!
              And it works the best when it is underground!
              It isn't a hassle for a green-and-white tassle
              They're the ones that BREW Imperium Compound!  

   Trelon of the Wood, he was very good, he
   Was a leader that had never been beat before;
   But Caid had Imperium Compound,
   And Imperial Roman Caid won the War!  //with help!//   

   In Tyr Ysgithr, it's regularly whispered there
   That the Kingdom is ruled over by a King    // What's THAT? //
   They're "democratic" and quite erratic....
   They've forgot the purpose of the whole damn thing!     

   King Sir Mark von, with his pretty white suit on,
   Rules the Kingdom both with Grace and Purity!
   He never touches Imperium Compound
   At least not where anyone else can see!               

   Duke Sir Deaton, was never beaten
   On the field, or in the drinking hall;
   At the Catbox War with Caid,
   Left thirty bodies piled against the wall!             

   Denis O'Titans was good at smitin'
   A Locksley Monster in every single way!
   Drank a little Imperium Compound
   And ATE Deaton's sword that day  // No! REALLY! //       

   Wotan the Mongoloid, a little bit paranoid,
   But a nice guy none the less;
   Drank a mess of Imperium Compound
   Now he's Justin du Roc, I confess!                       

   Then there's Duke Reynard, with a face like a St. Bernard
   Of the Dukes, he is the homliest
   He tends to toke up on Imperium Compound
   And go out and whomp on anybody's best!                   

   This song'll bedevil the folks at a revel,
   And most of the time it will annoy the King,
   So take a drink of Imperium Compound
   And let's go Royalty-bedeviling!                        

   Duchess Anna is quite a fan-a
   Going on a wartime shopping spree!  \\ War Point!\\
   Took a drink of Imperium Compound
   And shopped so fast we couldn't see! \\ Z-o-o-o-om!\\    (5)

  ATEN IMPERIUM (Cont.)

   Lyn of Whitewolfe, made of the right stuff,
   Twice the Queen of Atenveldt;
   Took a drink of Imperium Compound
   And the Kingdom of Caid before her knelt!              

   Duke Sir Brion, and Duke Sir Trelon,
   Won the Crown with regularity;
   Drank a lot of Imperium Compound,
   And founded a dynasty!                                 

   Stephan von Geist, was most awful nice,
   And a chivalrous fighter without any doubt
   Took a swig of Imperium Compound
   And won the Crown his first time out!                    

   All the Crusadenes were big, but not mean,
   And the finest fighters in the town.
   But they all drank Jerusalem Compound,
   Winning Crown after Crown after Crown!                 

   Good Duke Arthur couldn't get no farth-er
   A Norman King in Aten Land
   Drank too much of Imperium Compound
   And went off to conquer Engel-land!                    

   Then King Richard, a bit of a bitch, heard
   A King's Crown could be done.
   Drank a little Imperium Compound
   And became the Aten King, first one!                    

   Duchess Malinda, who doesn't do windas,
   But she does a lot of Duchess Things,
   But give her a LOT of Imperium Compound,
   And she sings and sings and sings and sings and sings!   

   Duke Sir Brion, with his pretty white suit on,
   Is a model of goodness and purity
   Never touches Imperium Compound
(spoken:) And I'll sell ya seashore property in Yuma, too!  

   Optional last verse:

   Many tales abound of Imperium Compound
   And its' strange effects on Royalty,
   But after an hour, this song has no power,
   And by now, it's boring ME!                            

   AltChorus: Oh it's too long, too long, too long
              To sing the whole song, the song, the song
              Longer than a Royal Court, it is!
              But sing it serial, this ditty Imperial
              And you'll be a bardic whiz!

        Last night I had the strangest dream in this bleak century
        I dreamed that people the world around believed in Chivalry

        I dreamed I saw a Kingly Crown enshrined in laurel leaves
        with Grace and Joy and Purity attendant at his feet

        I dreamed I saw the perfect Knight receive his accolade
        and minstrels sang and children laughed in some soft forest glade

        I dreamed I saw the finest thing that ever man could make
        grow great and strong and undefiled: Pray God I never wake!

        Last night I had the strangest dream in this bleak century
        I dreamed that people the world around believed in Chivalry

               (to the tune of "Good King Wenceslaus")

                Locksley Monsters never yield
                on the field of battle
                strike the helm and bash the shield
                make their eyeteeth rattle
                Bodies on the ground will lie
                bones will burst in sunder
                search for Locksleys' enemies:
                You'll find them six feet under!

                              SONG OF IVANOF

            There is a man who we know well that does the best he can
            but he's displayed in armour made of reticulated garbage cans!

            He looks so fine and fair and strong, oh how he plays the man
            and how it's prized, those galvanized, reticulated garbage cans

            The noblest Roman of them all, a good Praetorian
            a combatant who wears no pants, judst reticulated garbage cans!

            Like old Horatius at the Bridge, like the Legions of Valerian
            (O dearie me: those LOVELY knees!)
            and those reticulated garbage cans!

                         C. McCray Bethancourt

         (sung to the tune (obviously) of the 12 Days of Christmas)


1.           The first time I sent my device, The Heralds said to me

            "It violates the Rule of Three"

2.           The next time I tried it, the Heralds said to me

            "We changed the forms, and it violates the Rule of
             Three".

3.           The third time I tried, and the Heralds said to me, 

            "We upped the fees, we changed the forms, and it
             violates the Rule of Three".

4.           Another time I tried and the Heralds said to me,
 
            "We haven't got it, we upped the fees, we changed the 
             forms, and it violates the Rule of Three".

5.           The fifth time I tried it, the Heralds said to me,  

            "In a decision rendered by the College of Arms on
             August 1st, A.S. V it was decided that this style of
             heraldic design was not appropriate to the aims and 
             intentions of the Corporate Body. Holy! Holy! Holy! "

 note: verse 5 is delivered in an extremely fast, mono-
       tone, similiar to a Gregorian Chant.

           " ....we haven't got it, we upped the fees, we changed the forms,
             and it violates the Rule of Three."

6.           I tried it a sixth time, and the Heralds said to me,

            "We changed the rules, &c"

7.           A seventh time I tried and, the Heralds said to me,

            "It's against the Rule of Tincture, we changed the
             rules, &c"

8.           I tried it once again and the heralds said to me,

            "It's not a Period design, It's against the Rule of Tincture, We
             changed the rules, &c"

                                * more *



    Heralds Said To Me (cont.)

9.           I sent it in once more, and the Heralds said to me,

            "We changed the rules again, It's not a Period design,
             it's against the Rule of Tincture, we changed the
             rules, &c"

10. (sung in cold anger)
             The LAST time I sent my device, the Heralds said to me

    (sung in a state of SMUG)
             "Someone else has got it, &c"




              (nb: every single one of these reasons has been used by the
              CoA, at one point or another, to reject perfectly good
              heraldry, along with some even MORE stupid.  If the shoe 
              fits....................!!!!!!!!)

           or: Who was that Vermin I saw you with last, Knight?
   or: There may be Lice on all you Knice, but there ain't no Lice on me

           Once there was a Barony howling in the wilderness
           nestled in the Valley where the River doesn't flow
           and the folks were driven buggy by the insects in the Revel Hall
           Authenticity is wonderful, but this doesn't go!

                   Bugs on the Baroness, bugs on the Baroness!
                   That was the cry that you heard all the day
                   and the scratching can be heard from Ysgithr to Ered Sul
                   why did we come here? Let's go away!

           See them all a scratching, nestled in their armour tight
           the fleas have a melee team that's challenging the field!
           call Truly Nolen! Someone's gotta help us out!
           the crabs are nesting in our helms but we'll never yield!

                   (chorus)

           Dawn comes a-breaking, the bugs have won the Coronet...
           flea-infested Conan-clones in piles upon the lawn
           where is the Barony? The bugs have eaten everyone...
           termites got the stick-jocks, and all their sticks are gone!

                  For all the Lands where I have dwelt
                  Oh Atenveldt, Oh Atenveldt
                  till rivers burn and mountains melt
                  lest I forget my Atenveldt
                  From deserts stark to snow-capped peaks
                  from silent lakes and laughing creeks
                  sing: Oh let man find his heart's ease
                  on rocky plains
                  in desert breeze

                  For oft I thought of mighty men
                  who carved a Land with sword and pen
                  and lit a candle, burning bright,
                  that pierced the darkness; stirred the night!
                  tho some are gone their deeds remain
                  this sunny Crown without a stain
                  sing: Oh, their deeds were not in vain!
                  in sunlit days
                  and falling rain.....

                  So raise your banners, blazoned bright
                  Advance the Dream and Shine the Light!
                  in battle's crash and Revel's song
                  raise high the Flag and wave it long!
                  For all the Lands wherein I've dwelt
                  I love you best, my Atenveldt!
                  Sing: Oh the Joy that I have felt!

      What the use of wearing panties
      whalebone corsets of your Auntie's
      boxer shorts and other scanties
      best of all is nude
      there's such fun in going bra-less
      now that it's no longer lawless
      'specially if your figure's flawless
      best of all is nude
      nude is what you're born in
      shirts are never torn in
      underwear and lacy flimsies, garter belts and other whimsies
      yards of itchy cloth to put your form in
      ducks all do it, maidens rue it
      even ancient Picts in Britain blue it
      going naked's how to do it
      best of all is nude!

      If your garters aren't elastic
      tie them up in knots fantastic
      (panty hose is something drastic!)
      best of all is nude!
      If you're tired of wearing clotheses
      shed your garment 'mongst the roses
      never mind the old bluenoses
      best of all is nude!
      Nude is best for ducking!
      Worst for horses bucking!
      Moonlit nights will see such sights
          that are very best for fooling round
                              .....and elbows!
      Nudity is grand to see
       a well-known antidote to virginity
      take your clothes off and you'll see:
      best of all is nude!

                                  Sword and Roses in Her Hand
                                  spread their seeds thruout the Land

                                  Came the Stag from oaken wood
                                  saw the Lady where she stood
                                  by the fire burning bright
                                  came to know his heart's delight!

                   (end of extra verses)

                   By Sword and Harp, and Irish Hound
                   Blessed Be: the Day I've found
                   Hail to the Lady, one in Three
                   Present is Past and Past is WE

                   By Oak and Ash and Holy Thorn
                   bledded be the Day you're born!
                   Fire burn and fire bright
                   walk in safety thru the night

               I'll tell you a tale of Peace and Love

               Of those that Rule all Lands above

               When we were Sauvage, Fierce and Wilde
               they came as a Mother to her childe
               they gently raised us from the slime
               and kept our hands from Hellishe Crime
               and made us a Kingdom in their own good time

               Now, Atenveldt forgets the Past
               and thinks on a Day that's coming fast
               when we shall all be....civilized....(puke)

               oh won't the Directors be....suprised?!

                    WEAPONS AT THE DOOR

 Being a Polemic concerning the alleged Custom of the West Kingdom concerning 
 checking your Weapons at the Door of the Revel Hall. As the Satire is the 
 Weapon of the Bard, this said Polemic is to be checked at the Door, along with 
 swords, knives, redheaded Ladies and other such Deadly Things.....

         As I roved out to Western Lands to take the Western Air
         I went into a Revel Hall and I saw a Twelfth Night there
         but I was halted at the gate by a Privy Consellor
                 (that's the man who tells the King of the West how to go to
                  the bath room!)
         who told me I would have to check my Weapons at the door

         As I, in my astonishment, stood hung on tenter-pegs
         a Knight came in whose Prouess hung down between his legs
         the Doorman grabbed a greatsword and he struck the Knight full sore
         and gave him a reciept; he left his weapon at the door!

         a Bard was next whose goodly Voice has entertained us all
         but he, too, was prevented from entering the Hall
         and told he could not carry deadly weapons on the floor
         he left his Voice and Harp among the weapons at the door

         a Master entered graciously, a man we all know well
         who holds a 3rd Dan Black Belt, tho this he'd never tell
         the Master struggled valiantly, the Master cursed and swore
         but he left his hands, and feet, as weapons at the door

         the company was jovial, altho a bit dismayed
         for lack of proper cutlery, down to the smallest blade
         for even teeth and fingernails, each can be used in War
         were cut, and pulled, and left behind, as weapons at the door!

         And has their King not loyal Knights that He must be afraid
         of brawling in his Hall and of Assassin's bloody blade?
         the Rights of Men to carry Arms at least WE'VE not foreswore
         and a POX on them that made the Rule of Weapons at the Door!

                           THE STREETS OF ANN ARBOR

               As I walked out thru the streets of Ann Arbor
               as I walked out thru Ann Arbor one day
               I spied a young Mongol all dressed in white linen
               all dressed in white linen and cold as the clay

               I then spied another, done in on the sidewalk
               along with just about six dozen more
               their wounds were all gaping, from mace and from braoadsword
               from claymore and cannon, all dripping with gore

               what caused this grave carnage, I cried to the Monglos
               oh pray what's the reason for this awful sight
               my answer came slowly from under the corpse-pile
               "It seems that our bark is much worse than our bite....."

               the answer continued from pale lips a-shaking
               we sang all our songs and believed them as true
               the Dark Horde could never be beaten in battle
               we thought this was what all good Mongols could do...

               we went down to Atenveldt all for to plunder
               "too large to defend" was our song every night
               but Atenveldt's different from East, West or Middle
               there, even the bushes have learned how to bite!

               the Clann stole our ponies, the Scraelings our foodstuffs
               we ran into axes in AtenViking hands
               our maidens ran off with one Richard of Arkham
               and we're all that's left to return to our lands

               MacChluarains and Monsters, Lockehaven and Foxmoor
               that Kingdom is BIG and its' fighters are MEAN!
               we fought and we lost, and fled back to Ann Arbor
               we all came back home with results that you've seen

               keep away from that Land with its' cactus and marshes
               it's no place for Mongols who are bent on War
               they count their blows well, but they strick them yet better
               he crawled into his Yurt, and fell, dead, on the floor.....

                            C. A. Bethancourt III
       tune: the song of the Cowardly Lion, Tin Woodsman and Scarecrow
             in the movie version of the Wizard of Oz

        (Enter the Scarecrow, who singeth:)

        My wife is always nagging; my Prowess it is lagging
        I can't do anything
        she has got a reason, but revenge is out of season
        Oh I wish I could be King!

        If I just had the Crown on, I'd always have a frown on
        and the Barons on a string
        Heads they would be rolling, the Board would be cajoling
        Oh if only I was King!

        I am very fed up with the way this group is set up
        Oh I'd change everything!
        they are so high and mighty with the way that they do fight-ey
        Oh, someday I'll be King!

        Tho my wife is melancholic, and very...vitriolic
        she's a wasp without a sting!
        I'd have to supervise her with a pack of tranquilizers
        If I only was a King......

        (the Tin Woodsman joineth him, and singeth:)

        I grew up kind of cocky, and rather big, and stocky
        and straight as any rod
        on the field I'm a battallion, with the Ladies I'm a stallion
        ...Oh they'd better make me God!

        The other boys are jealous they say I'm over-zealous
        they'd do better to applaud
        the things that I am giving to this Dream that we are living
        oh I wish they'd make me God!

        They say that I'm conceited, but I'm just badly treated
        by people and by BoD
        just think of what they're missing by My Majesty dismissing
        Oh they'd better make me God!

        (the Cowardly Lion creepeth forth, and singeth:)

        Oh I could be a fighter, a great and mighty smiter
        and be the perfect knight
        it's a great and nasty shame, and everyone's to blame
        oh I wish that I could fight!

        Song of the Three (cont.)

        I could be a Cavalier drinking wine and ale and beer
        and be a gorgeous sight
        but it would cost me too much money so it isn't very funny
        oh I wish that I could fight!                               

        Let me at 'em on the field, I would surely make them yield
        to my Power and my Might
        with rattan, shinai and rapier they would nevermore escape here
        If they'd only let me fight

                She was afraid to come out to the Tourney
                She was worried that "something might show.."
                She was afraid to come out to the Tourney
                And the poor thing did NOT want to go...

                  (2 - 3 - 4, tell the people what she wore!)

                  It was an itsy bitsy teeny weenie little rabbit fur bikini
                  That she wore, for the first time, that day.
                  An itsy bitsy teenie weenie little rabbit fur bikini
                  And in her apartment she wanted to stay!

                One day in the Kingdom of the Middle
                It happened at a Tourney one day:
                The Mongols invaded the Middle
                But the Middle did not want to play...

                  (eins - zwei - drei, but the Dark Horde wouldn't die!)

                  It was an itsy bitsy tiny teenie Nauseating Mongol weenie
                  That they saw, for the first time, that day.
                  An itsy bitsy tiny teenie Nauseating Mongol weenie
                  And the Mongols did NOT go away!

                Now the Heralds made up a new Rulebook
                And to read it is some kind of gas!
                It's a bureaucrat's dream, this new Rulebook
                Now NOBODY'S blazon can pass!

                  (Win - Place - Show, tell the Heralds where to go!)

                                 (insert Bronx cheer!)

                  I want an itsy bitsy teenie weenie little rabbit fur bikini
                  On my shield, as my blazon, today!
                  An itsy bitsy teenie weenie little rabbit fur bikini
                  But "that's offensive" the Heralds all say!

                I sat down at the Revel last evening
                To a feast of green meat, and Rat Pie...
                It was cold, and disgusting, and greasy
                And I just want to upchuck and die!

                  (6 - 7 - 8, tell them what was on your plate!)

                  It was an itsy bitsy teenie weenie little rabbit fur bikini
                  With a side dish of cold cabbage pie!
                  An itsy bitsy teenie weenie little rabbit fur bikini

          Some folks call me many names, others call me crazy
          Tom O'Bedlam's son am I, for my mind is hazy!
          I'd rather sing a song than work (if it's not too phrasey!)
          Lengthy rhymes don't bother me....truth to tell: I'm lazy!

          Yang, your yurt is very nice, and your Horde is smelly,
          And I'm sure that yak-meat will nicely fill one's belly!
          But remember this one line, or you're not worth jelly:
          FIRST you plunder, THEN you burn! That's how to be rakehelly!

          My Lady Lorelei your eyes do drive me to distraction
          And the lovely Care-Cheri causes....petrifaction!
          But I, and they, quite taken are, so I can't take action...
          Therefore, Ladies, fill my cup; I'll drink to stupefaction!

          Now Atenveldt your fighters, all, are most good and gentle
          And the Ladies, bless 'em all, are most ornamental!
          But that little Nikki-Toad....has me sentimental
          Though with boffer in her hand she is argumental!

          This stupid little song, m'lords, is mostly sung in Latin
          By the Goliards, of course, from vespers clear to matins!
          But I prefer a coarser cloth over silk or satins

                      by William Poundstone
                              1983

     Two mentalities are at work here: 1960s rock fans and 1980s
fundamentalist Christians. The idea of phonographically concealed
messages dates from the Paul McCartney death scare of 1969. For
hard-core types, the secret-message rumors never really died. Avid
rock fans have auditioned ever album release since the late 1960s
for hidden nuances. Backward messages, barely audible messages,
and messages on one stereo track only have been alleged. At the
other end of the sociosensual spectrum, fundamentalist Christians
have gotten into the act. TV programs such as PRAISE THE LORD and
THE 700 CLUB have propagated rumors of a satanic plot in the
recording industry, no less, in which various albums conceal
"backward-masked" demonic murmurings. If THAT sounds too spacey to
be taken seriously, consider that it was the fundamentalist groups
who were behind House Resolution 6363, a bill introduced in the
U.S. House of Representatives by Robert K. Dornan (R., Calif.) in
1982 to label all suspect records: "WARNING: THIS RECORD CONTAINS
BACKWARD MASKING THAT MAKES A VERBAL STATEMENT WHICH IS AUDIBLE
WHEN THIS RECORD IS PLAYED BACKWARD AND WHICH MAY BE PERCEPTIBLE
AT A SUBLIMINAL LEVEL WHEN THIS RECORD IS PLAYED FORWARD." In
February 1983, the Arkansas State Senate passed a similar record-
labeling bill by a vote of 86 to 0.
     Contributing to the quasi-occult status of these rumors is
the difficulty of checking them out on home audio equipment. You
pretty much have to take someone else's word for it, or dismiss
the rumors out of hand.
     From a technical standpoint, there are four simple ways to
conceal a verbal message on a recording. The most obvious is to
record the message at a very low volume. The message may then be
recovered by turning the volume up while playing the record or
tape. If the message is faint enough, though, noise levels of home
equipment may garble it. If the accompanying music or lyrics are
loud enough, or if the message itself is indistinct or
electronically modified, it may be hard to hear on any equipment.
     A second gimmick is to record a message on one stereo track
only. Records and tapes have two independent recordings, of
course, normally played simultaneously for stereo effect. On a
record, each stereo track occupies on one side of the V-shaped
groove for the needle. On a tape, the tracks are recorded in
parallel lanes of the magnetic material. The two tracks are called
"right" and "left" after the stereo speakers they will play on.
Otherwise, the tracks are interchangeable -- the sound mixer can
put anything he or she wants on each track. A message on one track
can be masked by simultaneous loud music or lyrics on the opposite
track. With normal stereo balance (or mono equipment) the loud
track drowns out the message track. At home, single-track messages
can be recovered by adjusting the stereo balance so that only the
desired track plays. Sometimes this trick also makes indistinct
words clearer. Even if the words are not exclusively on one track,
they may happen to be more audible on one track.
     A message could be recorded at a speed different from the
rest of the record. Then the record would have to be played faster
or slower than usual to recover the message. Unless the message
was at one of the standard speeds (say, 45 rpm on a 33 1/3 rpm
record), it could not be played normally on home equipment.
     The fourth and most commonly alleged trick is to record a
verbal message backward. Reversed speech has several unexpected
features. One is that syllables are not a constant in the reversal
process. A one-syllable word can have two or three syllables when
played backward. Thus "number nine" in the Beatles' REVOLUTION 9
reverses to "Turn me on, dead man" (or something like it), a jump
from three to five syllables.
     There is no simple way to predict what a word or phrase will
sound like reversed. Obviously, you can't just reverse the
letters.
     Reversed messages are difficult to recover at home. Record
turntables are not built to go backwards. Some have a neutral
setting, in which the pickup and amplifier remain active and you
can turn the record backward by hand. But hardly anyone has a
stead enough hand to produce satisfactory results.
     With patience, it is possible to reverse a cassette
recording. Transfer the music from the original record or tape
onto a blank tape cassette. Place the cassette flat on a table.
Draw our the part of the tape with the suspected message and snip
it off at both ends. Hold the tape segment horizontally. Rotate it
180 degrees, keep it horizontal at all times. This turns the tape
end for end. Splice the reversed tape segment back onto the two
loose ends of the cassette with strong adhesive tape. Reel the
tape back inside the cassette. The sliced segment will play
backward on an ordinary cassette player.
     I rented a recording studio to test the secret-message
rumors. New copiies of the records in question were transcribed on
a quarter-inch master tape. Where rumor alleged that a single
stereo track contained a message, right and left stereo tracks
were transcribed separately. Records with alleged inaudible
messages were treated similarly. To test claims of reversed
messages, recordings on the master tape were edited out and
spliced in backward. Twenty cuts or portions of cuts from sixteen
albums were tested.


"Another One Bites the Dust"
Queen, THE GAME

Rumor: When played backward, the lyrics say, "It's fun to smoke
marijuana."
Findings: There is something that sounds like "It's fun to smoke
marijuana" in the reversed music. It is repeated over and over. It
might be rendered no less faithfully, however, as "sfun to scout
mare wanna." This "message" is the reversal of the song title,
which is repeated as a line in the song.
     Let's make a distinction between engineered and phonetic
reversals. When an artist records a verbal statement, reverses it
by turning the tape end for end, mixes the reversed statement onto
a master tape, and has records and tapes produced from the master,
that is an engineered reversal. When the phonetic properties of
song lyrics are such that they can be reversed to sound like
something else, that is a phonetic reversal.
     "It's fun to smoke marijuna" is clearly a phonetic reversal.
The lyrics are perfectly plain played forward ("Another one bites
the dust"), no so plain played backward ("sfun to scout mare
wanna"). With an engineered reversal, the opposite should hold
true: gibberish forward, clear as a bell backward. Some are
prepared to believe that phonetic reversals are just as
intentional as engineered reversals -- that the songwriter
painstakinginly planned the phonetic double-entendre. In the
absence of confirming evidence, that just doesn't wash. It's too
easy to find coincidences. If, for example, the letters of the
alphabet are recited in conventional fashion (Ay, Bee, Cee, etc.)
and reversed, at least five sound like English language words. D
reverses to "eden," F becomes "pray," S becomes "say," V becomes
"even," and Z becomes "easy." "It's fun to smoke marijuana" is
likewise a coincidence.


"A Child is Coming"
Jefferson Starship, BLOWS AGAINST THE EMPIRE

Rumor: When played backward, "son of Satan."
Findings: Another phonetic coincidence. The repeated "It's getting
better" reverses to an iffy "son of Satan," the "of" drawn out and
the "Satan" strongly accented on the first syllable.


"Eldorado"
Electric Light Orchestra, ELDORADO

Rumor: When played backward, "He is the nasty one/ Christ, you're
infernal/ It is said we're dead men/ Everyone who has the mark
will live."
Findings: Coincidence. The supposed message lurks around the line
"On a voyage of no return to see." Reversed, this passage becomes
the expected syllable salad -- no one hearing it would describe it
as anything but reversed music. Only if you listen while reading
along with what you're supposed to hear will you get anything. The
rumored version of the message is somewhat fudged. The passage
sounds more like "He's to nasty one/ Christ you are, Christ,
you're fernal/ There wiss uh, we're dead men..." There is no "in"
in what is taken to be "infernal." The line that is supposed to be
"Everyone who has the mark will live" isn't even close, though the
syllable count is right.


"Shoo Be Doo"
The Cars, CANDY-O

Rumor: When played backward, the word "Satan" repeated
approximately eleven times.
Findings: Coincidence. The rumor refers to the reversal of the "Shoo
be doo, shoo be doo, shoo be doo..." near the end of the song. Given
the mysterious logic of reversed phonemes, these three-syllable units
can be hard as a repeated two-syllable word. The word sounds a little
like "Satan."


"Snowblind"
Styx, PARADISE THEATER

Rumor: According to a mimeographed list of suspect records distributed
by Congressman Dornan, the words "Satan move through our voices" when
played backwards.
Findings: Negative. Despite repeated listenings, it was not even
possible to identify the part of the reversed track that Dornan et al.
are talking about.


"Stairway to Heaven"
Led Zeppelin, untitled, a.k.a. STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN

Rumor: In reverse, "I live for Satan... The Lord turns me off...
There's no escaping it... Here's to my sweet Satan... There's power in
Satan... He will give you 666."
Findings: Coincidence. If you listen very carefully to the "And it
makes me wonder" lines in reverse, you'll hear something approaching
"There's no escaping it." A better description is "There's no escape
do." Knock of the last syllable, and you have "There's no escape," a
complete, intelligible sentence in reverse. It's there, all right, but
it's not an unlikely enough coincidence to -- well, make you wonder.
      The "Satan" in "I live for Satan" is good and clear. The "I live
for" part isn't. The other alleged lines are unremarkable. All are
phonetic reversals of the entirely lucid forward lyrics and obviously
just accidents.


"When Electricity Came to Arkansas"
Black Oak Arkansas, BLACK OAK ARKANSAS and RONCH AND ROLL

Rumor: In reverse, "Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan. He is God. He
is God."
Findings: The BLACK OAK ARKANSAS cut was reversed. Again, pairs of
reversed syllables are being freely interpreted as "Satan." "He is
God" was not identifiable.


"Rain"
The Beatles, HEY JUDE

Rumor: Unintelligible lyrics at the end are reversed.
Findings: A true engineered reversal and not really a secret. "Rain"
seems to have been the first popular recording to incorporate an
obviously reversed lyric. The story is that John Lennon accidentally
spliced the last part of the song in backward and liked the effect.
When reversed, the strange-sounding vocals at the end become
intelligible as a reprise starting with the drawn-out word
"sunshine."
      The reversal is less apparent to the casual listener than it
might be because the accompanying music is not reversed. The ending
fits in smoothly with the rest of the song, the vocals suggesting a
foreign language.


"Fire on High"
Electric Light Orchestra, FACE THE MUSIC

Rumor: When played backward, "The music is reversible, but time --
turn back!"
Findings: "Fire on High" is instrumental. About twenty-six seconds
into the music, scrambled speech is heard. It is mostly louder than
the accompanying music and begins with a two-syllable unit repeated
several times. The seeming speech lasts for about fourteen seconds.
      Reversing the music confirms that there is a true, engineered
message. In reverse, a voice (Jeff Lynne's?) says, "The music is
reversible, but time -- turn back! Turn back! Turn back! Turn back!"
All the words are clear and unambiguous. Anyone comparing this to the
alleged reversal on ELO's "Eldorado" will have no trouble telling
which is genuine.


"Goodbye Blue Sky"
Pink Floyd, THE WALL

Rumor: In reverse, "You have discovered the secret message."
Findings: The "secret message" is at the very end of the instrumental
passage following the "Goodbye Blue Sky" vocals. It comes just before
the words "What shall we do" at the start of the song that is
identified as "Empty Spaces" on the record label and as "What shall we
do now?" on the record sleeve. Played forward, the message is less
apparent than the FACE THE MUSIC reversal: A reasonably attentive
listener might play THE WALL through and not catch it. It suggests
speech not quite close enough to be overheard. In context this is not
unusual because the "Goodbye Blue Sky" instrumental passage includes
"airport noises" and other sound effects. A loud climax in the music
further masks the unintelligible voice.
      When played backward, the voice (Roger Waters?) plainly intones,
"Congratulations, you have just discovered the secret message. Please
send your answer to old Pink, care of the funny farm..." As the voice
fades out, there may be another word -- perhaps "Chalfonte or
"Chelsea" -- after "funny farm."


"Heavy Metal Poisoning"
Styx, KILROY WAS HERE

Rumor: A red sticker on the KILROY WAS HERE cover warns, "By order of
the Majority for Musical Morality, this album contains secret backward
messages..."
Findings: This is a case of second-generation backward-masking. Styx'
PARADISE THEATER did not contain a backward message, though a lot of
people said it did. So Styx has included a sure enough backward
message on KILROY WAS HERE. It is at the very beginning of "Heavy
Metal Poisoning." The reversed speech last about three seconds. There
is no musical background. The words reverse to "Annuit coeptis. Novus
ordo seclorum." This is the Latin motto encircling the pyramid on the
back of a dollar bill. The usual translation: "God has favored our
undertakings. A new order of the ages."
      The cover sticker's "Majority for Musical Morality" is a
fictitious Falwellesque group in the KILROY WAS HERE video. Although
the sticker suggests a plurality of "messages," only one was found.


Space between "I'm So Tired" and "Blackbird"
The Beatles, untitled, a.k.a. THE WHITE ALBUM

Rumor: A reversed message. At the time of the Paul-is-dead stories,
the segue from "I'm So Tired" to "Blackbird" was offered as evidence.
It was held to contain John Lennon's voice, reveresed, saying "Paul is
dead, miss him, miss him, miss him." That interpretation seems
unlikely now, but there is a mysterious low muttering between the
songs.
Findings: The mumbling is actually just to the "I'm So Tired" side of
the shiny "space" between cuts on the record. Each of the stereo
tracks was recorded separately, twice, and a copy of each track was
reversed. This produced four versions of the two-second passage: right
forward, left forward, right reversed, and left reversed. All were
equally unintelligible. It was not even apparent whether the voice is
forward or reversed. Nor could John Lennon be identified as the
speaker. There are nine or ten syllables. The first six (when played
forward) are a two-syllable unit repeated three times. There is little
or no difference betwen the stereo tracks. Any claimed interpretation
of the sounds seems doubtful.


"Strawberry Fields Forever"
The Beatles, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR

Rumor: It was, of course, claimed that John Lennon says "I buried
Paul" at the end. (It's forward, at the very end after the music
fades to complete silence, returns, and starts to fade out again.)
But Lennon told ROLLING STONE that the words are "cranberry
sauce."
Findings: They are "cranberry sauce." The "sauce"/"Paul" part is
indistinct, but the first syllable sounds a lot more like "cran"
than "I."


"Baby You're a Rich Man"
The Beatles, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR

Rumor: On one of the tracks the line "Baby you're a rich man too"
is sung as "Baby you're a rich fag Jew," a dig at Brian Epstein.
Or some think it's "rich fat Jew" and claim it as evidence of
Beatle anti-Semitism.
Findings: Negative. The two stereo tracks are nearly identical.
It's always possible to hear words as similar-sounding words, but
basically, the lyrics jibe with the published version.


"Revolution 9"
The Beatles, untitled, a.k.a. THE WHITE ALBUM

Rumor: Various reversed and/or one-track speech. The reversal of
"Number nine" to "Turn me on, dead man" has pretty much been
discounted as coincidence (though it appears on Congressman
Dornan's list).
Findings: Distinction between lyrics and any hidden message blurs
on "Revolution 9." The eight-minute cut is a montage of sounds
collected by John Lennon and Yoko Ono. It includes discordant
music, radio broadcasts, sirens, applause, gunfights, sports
cheers, the crackling of a fire, screams, a baby gurgling, a choir
singing, and much that cannot be identified. For this
investigation, "Revolution 9" was transcribed four times, twice on
each stereo channel. One copy of each of the tracks was reversed.
The four resulting versions were compared with each other and
against the original two-channel version.
     "Revolution 9" contains a lot of talking. Played in stereo,
forward, the longest stretch of understandable speech is probably
an announcer saying, "...every one of them knew that as time went
by they'd get a little bit older and a little bit slower..."
     One believable instance of reversed speech occurs: someone
saying "Let me out! Let me out!" (once held to represent McCartney
in his totaled Aston-Martin). Two iffy reversals occur on the
backward recording of the right stereo track:"She used to be
assistant" and "There were two men..." Neither is clear enough or
long enough to be convincing. Some of the music, including the
recurring theme, sounds more natural in reverse.
     "Turn me on, dead man" is a typical phonetic reversal. The
forward "number nine" (repeated throughout the cut) is clear; the
reversal is slurred -- something like "turn me on dedmun." It has
been claimed that "number nine" must be pronounced with a British
accent or with some careful inflection in order to reverse to
"Turn me on, dead man." This seems not to be so. As an experiment,
three American-accent renderings of "number nine" were reversed.
All sound about as much like "Turn me on, dead man" as the record
did. Like the other phonetic reversals, "Turn me on, dead man"
must be considered a coincidence.
     Much of "Revolution 9" is on one stereo track only. Near the
end a voice says "A fine natural imbalance...the Watusi...the
twist...Eldorado...Eldorado." "A fine natural imbalance" is on the
right track only, though the words that follow are in stereo. One
of the longer bits of speech -- "Who could tell what he was
saying? His voice was low and his [unintelligible] was high and
his eyes were low" -- is clear on the left track, a bare whisper
on the right.
     There is a stereophonically concealed "secret message" on
"Revolution 9." The words are on the right track. They begin about
four minutes, fifty-eight seconds into the cut and run for about
twenty-two seconds. They are not likely to be noticed in stereo
because of the much louder left track. The sound of applause
begins on the left track at about five minutes, one second into
the cut. Deafening noises -- the clapping, sirens, music --
continue on the left track until five minutes, forty seconds. It
may or may not have been Lennon's and Ono's intention to conceal
the spoken passage. Given the haphazard quality of "Revolution 9,"
the concealment may have been accidental. To recover the passage,
the left track must be switched off. The right track can then be
heard to contain a sound like a stopwatch ticking, behind these
words:

     So the wife called, and we better go to see a
     surgeon....[A SCREAM MUFFLES A LINE THAT SOUNDS LIKE
     Well, what with the prices, the prices have snowballed,
     no wonder it's closed.] ...So any and all, we went to
     see the dentist instead, who gave him a pair of teeth,
     which wasn't any good at all. So instead of that he
     joined the bloody navy and went to sea.
                      by William Poundstone
                              1986

     There really are backward messages on rock albums. And the
controversy over "backward masking" and "porn rock" has inspired a
whole new spate of messages. There may have been more genuine
backward messages in the past few years than ever before.
     The backward message controversy is usually traced to the
1960s and John Lennon's avant-garde sound mixing on such tracks as
"Revolution 9" on the Beatles' WHITE ALBUM. Lennon probably wasn't
trying to conceal a message so much as create an interesting
sound.
     The matter might have ended right there had it not been for
the Paul McCartney death rumor. College kids tried playing Beatles
records forward, backward, and at various speeds to find "clues"
to McCartney's fate. In the process they found snippets of speech
from Lennon's experiments. Even after McCartney was found safe and
sound in Scotland, some listeners continued to look for hidden
messages.
     Somehow, fundamentalist Christian groups became convinced
(ca. 1982) that the alleged messages were commercials for devil
worship. Not a single indisputable satanic message has turned up,
but there were scattered attempts to ban or label certain albums.
In 1986 one fundamentalist group announced that the theme song for
the old MR. ED TV show contains the word "Satan" when played
backward.)
     Ironically, the publicity accorded nonexistent messages has
inspired several artists -- among them porn rock hearing witness
Frank Zappa -- to hide real background messages in their music.
It's easy to do.
     The performer speaks or sings the message normally, then
reverses the tape, which is mixed into the soundtrack. This is all
accomplished simply enough at any recording studio.
     What's not so simple is playing it back. More home record,
cassette, and compact disk players won't play backward. You can
turn a record backward with a pencil eraser, but it's not good for
the needle or the turntable. The only way to reproduce the message
with full fidelity is to use a professional-quality reel-to-reel
tape player and splice the tape in backward.
     We used the facilities of KLOS radio in Los Angeles to
reverse some recent records containing true backward messages.


"Secret Messages"
Electric Light Orchestra, SECRET MESSAGES

ELO's ELDORADO album was among those alleged to contain satanic
backward masked messages. A patient listening to ELDORADO played
backward reveals no such messages. You hear only what you ought to
hear -- the reversed lyrics of the songs, which sound nothing like
the "messages" claimed to be there. In the wake of such
allegations, ELO did put an (innocuous) backward message on their
FACE THE MUSIC album. Perhaps they thought this would show how
silly the allegations were. Instead, the backward-masking people
seized on this as proof that the other "messages" were real. In
the latest volley, ELO has named an album after the controversy.
     In Britain (where the backward-masking issue is viewed as an
American eccentricity), the cover of SECRET MESSAGES has a mock
warning label to youth about the hidden label. Word of the albums'
impending release in the United States caused enough of a furor to
chill CBS Records into deleting the cover blurb.
     The reversed message is easy to find. It's at the beginning
of the first song, which is itself called "Secret Messages." You
can hear reversed speech when you play the record normally. A
voice intones "secret messages" -- forward -- in the middle of the
reversed speech, lest anyone dare be so unhip as to not know
what's going on.
     We transferred a new copy of SECRET MESSAGES to reel-to-reel
tapes and played it backward. The backward message goes: "WELCOME
TO THE BIG SHOW/ WELCOME TO THE BIG SHOW."
     That's it.


"Ya Hozna"
Frank Zappa, THEM OR US

"Ya Hozna," a six-minute composition on the first record of the
THEM OR US double album, is ENTIRELY backward. The albums' inner
cover, which includes lyrics for the other songs, says, "backwards
vocal -- you figure it out" of this cut. It credits Frank and Moon
Zappa, George Duke, and Napoleon Murphy Brock as vocalists.
     Played forward, "Ya Howza" sounds like a record played
backward -- reasonably so. The vocals are prominent and
unintelligible. Moon Zappa's voice is curiously recognizable, even
in reverse. It is hard to tell whether the music was recorded
forward or backward.
     When "Ya Howza" is played in reverse, you discover that the
music is virtually a palindrome -- it sounds about the same
forward and backward. The voices are all backward. In some cases
they have been modified electronically. Many of the words are
muffled. Even after repeated careful listening on both stereo
tracks, it is difficult to make out many of the lyrics. It doesn't
help that some of the words seem to be stream-of-consciousness
nonsense. Some of the unintelligible stuff sounds like opera.
     Starting at the beginning of the reversed tape -- the end of
the forward tape -- the clearer vocals go like this: "I am the
heaven, I am the water." This is in a hymnlike register. "You are
a lonely little girl./ But your mommy and your daddy hold you." A
singsong synthesizer voice.
     The most interesting part of the lyrics is an intermittently
orgasmic rap in Moon Zappa's Valley Girl voice. There are three
short monologues:

I'm like green!
I'm like squat!
I'm like soul!
Repeat, like soul!
I'm like pull, push,
Okay, like slow, slow.

You're never too old
Like slow, like slow, like slow
Okay, I like it.


All right, faster, faster,
Go, do it, do it twice,
Yeah, that feels good,
I'm looking great,
Yeah, fer shure!
Like, no way!


"No Anchovies, Please"
J. Geils Band, LOVE STINKS

"No Anchovies, Please" is a novelty song, really a narration with
sound effects, about a woman who is kidnapped after eating
anchovies. She is taken to a "foreign-speaking" country. The sound
effect of the foreign tongue seems reversed. When you do play it
in reverse, it becomes: "It doesn't take a genius to know the
difference between chicken shit and chicken salad."


"Darling Nikki"
Prince, PURPLE RAIN

"Darling Nikki," cited as porn rock before Congress, is about a
dominatrix in a hotel lobby masturbating with a magazine. In part,
the complaint was that the album cover (flowers, and Prince on a
motorcycle) wasn't explicit enough to warn kids of the suggestive
lyrics. Senator Paula Hawkins apparently was not aware of a
backward message hidden in "Darling Nikki." The last thirty-five
seconds of the song is gibberish. The music changes abruptly and
becomes a repeated glottal sound. Then a two-syllable sound is
repeated twice, something like "heaven, heaven." Unintelligible
speech follows. At the end is a sound reminiscent of rain or bacon
frying , and wind sounds.
     Played backward, the message becomes:

     Hello, how are you?
     I'm fine 'cause I know that the Lord is coming soon.
     Coming, coming soon.

     It is clearly Prince and the Revolution singing this. The
words are clear but the intonation is funny -- the linger on some
words. Perhaps this is to make the reversed message you hear
playing the record normally a little less conspicuous.
     This is a weird reversal of the supposed secret message
menace. Raunchy forward lyrics conceal a religious secret message.


"Judas Kiss"
Petra, MORE POWER TO YOU

Petra is an obscure group that sings religious songs to a rock
beat. As further proof that things have gone full circle, the
backward-masking controversy prompted Petra to include a wholesome
backward message on their MORE POWER TO YOU album. It is in the
transition between two songs, just before "Judas Kiss." Clearly
audible gibberish reverses to this (the husky voice a cross
between George Beverly Shea and Dee Snider): "What are you looking
for the Devil for, when you ought to be looking for the Lord?"

AFL JoyceM Welcome to the Apple II Music & Sound chat - our discussion will
           be on NoiseTracker - the new FTA music program for the GS.  AFA
           Gene will be our host this evening...Gene, the floor is yours :)

AFA Gene   Hi all... well first I'd like to point out, if y'all aren't aware
           yet, that a spanking new version of NoiseTracker has recently
           been released (9 days ago) and is now available in our New Files
           library. It is version 0.5. I haven't played around with it much
           yet, but it's supposed to fix a lot of the little bugs in 0.3
           (the first version we had online).  NoiseTracker also includes
           the ability to directly import "modules," a term used for a
           certain type of Amiga song file which has become popular among PC
           users using the SoundBlaster sound card.

           Now, via NT, these "MOD" files are accessible by the GS. We
           expect to see a lot of activity on this end as far as ports from
           the PC and Amiga go. Note that you should be able to go straight
           to the PC music forum and download any recently uploaded MOD
           songfiles (there was a bug in the first wide release of the PCAO
           software, however, so a bunch of files with dates between around
           March 1991 and September 1991 may not download properly. Note that
           to use these PC MOD files, you'll have to rename the downloaded
           file "MOD.xxxxxx" if you want it to show up automatically in NT's
           "open" dialog box. (On the PC, all MOD files are named
           "xxxxxxxx.MOD" instead.)   Also, if the files are packed with ZIP
           compression, you'll need a program from the Communications Forum
           called AGATE -- it's a terminal program that includes the ability
           to unpack ZIP files.

           Now, I guess the best thing to do would be to talk about our
           favorite songfiles... there have been a few complaints, in fact,
           that people were not being "descriptive" enough in their file
           descriptions for uploads in describing the songs.

AFC Eddie  ?

AFA Gene   GA ed

AFC Eddie  Once a MOD file is unpacked with Agate, is a file type change
           needed?

AFA Gene   Nope, since all that NT looks for is the "MOD." being the first
           four characters in the filename.

AFC Eddie  OK, Thanks!

Deanna7332 Question...

JonL7      Can you list some of the features of Noisetracker?

AFA Gene   (you don't even need that "MOD." if you want to type the name in
           directly.)

Deanna7332 Did any of these mod files have anything to do with FTA's "Module
           A"

AFA Gene   Sure Jon, right after we answer Deanna's question. Deanna, you
           mean "Modulae?"

Deanna7332 Yes, that's it.

AFA Gene   Modulae was a demo written by FTA last year. (i'll get to you in a
           sec Doors).  It used SoundSmith v0.95 for all it's music. There
           is no connection between MOD files and Modulae by FTA.

Deanna7332 Throughout the demo it said "Loading modules"

AFA Gene   Those "modules" are not the same as Amiga soundfile "modules" --
           you see, what Modulae really was was a "stringing together" of a
           bunch of neat little tiny demos that FTA had written. So they
           called each little demo a "module" and thus the entire demo as a
           whole, "Modulae" (fancy plural of module?)

Deanna7332 Ok I understand.  Thank you. :)

AFL JoyceM Latin, Gene :)

AFA Gene   The term "MODule" from the Amiga comes from the idea that all the
           stuff needed to play the songfile (all the instruments + the
           sequence file) are included into one file, the "module."

TheDoors1  Gene, I have tried to d/l some recent uploaded MODs in the PC
           music area and still the problem exists.

AFA Gene   As I understand it, the problem was fixed VERY recently (correct
           me on this Joyce) and files uploaded as recently as early
           November still might not work depending on the version of the
           PCAO software that the uploader used.

AFL JoyceM Actually, Gene...I was under the impression that it had been, but
           if Doors is still having a problem, then it must not be fixed.

AFA Gene   What date was the file you tried to d/l, Door?

TheDoors1  umm 11/17, around there

AFA Gene   hmmm.... well i can tell you one thing... if it didn't work, don't
           waste your time again later... the problem is in the Apple
           software's method of d/lling files, and there are no plans to
           upgrade the Apple AO software.

AFL JoyceM I will endeavor to get an answer to that PC downloading
           problem/question :)

ThomasK63  i have a quick question... what can you use to unpack amiga mod
           files? On the PC side, that is.

TheDoors1  Agate Thomas

ELECTMUSIC Doors... what happens on after downloading..

Deanna7332 If it's LZHed you can't unless you have an IBM or
           PC/Transporter.

AFA Gene   If GS-ShrinkIt doesn't have that ability, i don't think there
           exists any such utility on the GS.

TheDoors1  What do you mean Elect?

ELECTMUSIC After you download the file... where do you encounter a problem?

TheDoors1  ok, you know when you download the file and at some point in the
           download the file starts to appear on your screen.  That's when I
           cancel it.

ThomasK63  I am sure soething good can be made w/out resorting to Amiga
           files

AFC Eddie  Yes, Doors, I believe the problem is with the PC software it was
           UL'd with.

TheDoors1  yeah Eddie.

GNO Tim    Amiga MOD files are typically compressed using LHarc.  I've
           uncompressed several on my Unix machine at school.

ThomasK63  good time for someone to make a lharc unpacker...

AFC DYAJim someone might be ;)

GNO Tim    Several people are already

AFC Eddie  Can't wait, Jim!

AFA Gene   Jon, did you have a question?

JonL7      The features of Noisetracker :)

AFA Gene   Oh yes... okay, here goes, in a nutshell, from most important to
           least:


AFA Gene   *  ability to import MOD files

           *  ability to import Soundsmith files

           *  ProDOS 8 based

           *  virtually no editing abilities (not a feature but important to
           know)

AFC DYAJim :)

AFA Gene   *  forgot: and the most important feature of all, the ability to
           hold instrument files in regular system RAM instead of DOC RAM,
           allowing for instruments far beyond the regular 64K limit found
           in ALL other GS music programs.

ThomasK63  I'll buy that!

TheDoors1  I have another question...when you're ready.

AFA Gene   GA Doors

TheDoors1  ok..is it true that NoiseTracker will take in soundsmith files and
           play them more clearly

AFA Gene   Well, as far as "what you hear," yes there is a definite
           difference with some instruments. It does NOT play the sounds
           more "clearly," but it just plays them in a different way. What
           many people seem to like about this "different way" is that
           sustained instruments (i.e. instruments designed to be played
           in a loop to simulate a long held note) seem to work better (or
           perhaps simply the way they were originally intended to work).

TheDoors1  I see

Deanna7332 Which takes up more space - MOD or NT  w/soundfile ?

AFA Gene   Deanna, it depends a few things, such as how big the sequence is,
           how many instruments you have, etc. Once you have a lot of
           assorted files, it'll probably average out to be about the same
           give or take a hundred blocks on your HD. So it basically depends
           on whether you prefer to have your instruments separate or not.

Deanna7332 Does playing quality differ with either one ?

AFA Gene   Nope. It's exactly the same either way. Loading time is the same
           too.

AFC Eddie  Can NT save songs as MOD files?

AFA Gene   Nope. It has options for Open and Close module, but these are
           still inactive.

AFA Gene   If there are no more questions, I'd like to talk about which NT
           files out there are the "hottest," since this info could be
           useful to many users who are interested in downloading NT/MOD
           files.

           My personal favorite is "Lambada," which is supplied by FTA with
           the program but is available separately on America
           Online.Everything about this file is really impressive except
           perhaps the sound quality of the horn-ish melody instrument.

           What about y'all, what are your favorite NT files?

AFL JoyceM Gene, there is a classical song for NT, but can't remember the
           name, but it is good.

AFC Eddie  I like Dragnet!

ELECTMUSIC So do I Ed

TheDoors1  I like Seven something

Deanna7332 My most favorite of all mod files is Pleasure Principle

AFC Eddie  <--appreciate's Greg's taste!

AFL JoyceM :)

AFA Gene   Deanna, i assume you got that from a local board?

Deanna7332 I got it from the PC forum here.

TheDoors1  I saw it there also

Deanna7332 I think under "Pleasure"

AFA Gene   Would you be able to upload it here? If it's really that good, we
           ought to have it available directly in our oun NT lib here (BTW
           folks, we will be releasing a new NoiseTracker software library
           soon!)

AFC Eddie  What a Forum!!!

Deanna7332 That sounds great!

AFL JoyceM Gene, do you think it will be possible for synthLAB files to be
           converted to MOD files?

AFL JoyceM MOD files?

AFA Gene   I doubt it, Joyce. The formats are so diametrically opposed in
           their entire basis of their file formats that it wouldn't be
           worth the time for a programmer to develop such a convertor.

Deanna7332 Isn't it possible to move the mod file from the PC forum to our
           music library?

AFA Gene   But..... it might be worth the time for a MIDI File Format to MOD
           convertor, since these two formats are more widely accepted.

Nuzz       they have nothing better to do Gene

ELECTMUSIC Gene.. some interesting similarities with DTune and NTracker

AFA Gene   They lose the file, tho, Deanna. :)

AFL JoyceM In what way, Greg?

ELECTMUSIC Both Prodos 8

Deanna7332 Shhh they won't know a thing :)

ELECTMUSIC I also believe Bill uses a shuttling of sound data between Doc
           Ram and Ram.

AFC Eddie  Interesting, Greg.

ELECTMUSIC Thats how he gets some of the excellent instrument quality

AFC Eddie  But Diversitune has that one distinction:  MIDI input.

AFL JoyceM Deanna, we would greatly appreciate it if you would upload that
           'Pleasure' song to our library :)

ELECTMUSIC Agreed Ed.. one of the factors FTA doesn't like to incorporate
           into their programs.

Deanna7332 I'll u/l it tonight if possible.

AFL JoyceM Thanks :)

AFC Eddie  Thanks, Deanna!

AFL JoyceM I will send Bill B a copy of NoiseTracker + some MOD files...to
           see what comments we get from him (will send when I get back).

AFC DYAJim What ever happened to that diversitune upgrade that was talked
           about ?

ELECTMUSIC That would be interesting Joyce

AFC Eddie  Bill apparently still working on it, Jim.

ELECTMUSIC I am sure he would appreciate the Prodos 8

AFC DYAJim good..

AFL JoyceM Jim...RSN....he was hoping by Christmas (this year), but he is
           soooo busy with his job, who knows?

AFC DYAJim Oh yeah, I noticed the speed calcuation in NT .5 is inaccurate
           :)

AFC DYAJim I recall he has set a lot of Christmas projected dates :)

ELECTMUSIC He was one of the first "Free Tools" experts in breaking all the
           rules for economic sake.

AFC DYAJim like for the vaporware DT inst editor like 2 years ago.

Deanna7332 Are there any Christmas Mod or NT songs?

AFC Eddie  Oh yeah, Diversi-Editor!

AFL JoyceM I know, Jim - but that I know he has been working on.

AFC DYAJim he projected Christmas for it, and it never came :)

AFA Gene   Not yet in AMS, but hopefully the Holiday Contest will change all
           that. :)

AFC DYAJim I look foreward to any upgrades..

AFL JoyceM Not that I am aware of Deanna - you have some?  hint, hint

Deanna7332 Nope sorry.  I was hoping there were some that could be u/led
           here

AFC DYAJim I'll be breaking out the xmas tune book rsn.. I should be able to
           midi a few :) (which rules out nt)

AFL JoyceM Question...

AFC Eddie  It would be more appropriate to have a converter from Appleworks
           spreadsheet to MOD than from MIDI!

AFL JoyceM If I got ahold of an Amiga song (MOD) disk...how would I convert
           them for here?

AFA Gene   You mean an Amiga-formatted disk?

AFL JoyceM Yes

AFC DYAJim Ack.. methinks you need an amiga and a null modem cable or a
           modem.

AFA Gene   Methinks Jim is right

AFC DYAJim LOL!!  Design your music in the spreadsheet then import to NT :)
           IT might actually have better editing?!! :)

AFC Eddie  Right!

AFL JoyceM Me thinks he is right.  If I had them upload to me, would that
           work?

AFA Gene   Yep; should work like a charm.

AFC DYAJim Yah.. as long as they're coming from an amiga

AFL JoyceM Great....I will work on that when I get back  (making note now).

AFL JoyceM Gene, will you get some of those files (NT) sent to that area
           tonight?  If so, I will leave the needed message :)

AFA Gene   That's all I have planned for tonight's chat, Joyce. Yep, I'll
           move some files right now.

AFL JoyceM Thanks...

AFL JoyceM Then we should have our NoiseTracker Library by end of the week in
           AMS :)

ELECTMUSIC Gene... quick question:  Are you launching NTracker from a 3.5
           disk?

AFL JoyceM Okay, guys...I will see you all the week of December 11th (may the
           4th) as I am off on vacation.

AFA Gene   Yep greg

AFC JohnC  Where are you going?

ELECTMUSIC Do you encounter out of memory problems

AFL JoyceM Night all...and Gene, thanks for an excellent chat and great
           explanations of NoiseTracker.

Nuzz       Joyce, I have good news for FutureSound owners. SoundConvert will
           support it in the first release

AFC Eddie  Great, Mike!

AFA Gene   Greg, i always keep my RAMdisk at 0 when using noisetracker. Not
           only are

AFC JohnC  Mike...SoundConvert...released?

AFL JoyceM Great, Mike.  When can we get SoundConvert, Mike? and FutureSound
           :)

AFA Gene   there a couple of bugs with memory management, but if you're
           loading in a MOD file that's really big, NT will eat your RAMdisk.

AFC Eddie  Sounds good.

Nuzz       The manual is being "layout". Release date should be about 1st
           week of Dec

ELECTMUSIC Tnxs Gene

AFC JohnC  YES.......WTG Nuzz!!!!!!!!

Deanna7332 Yes, why is there on some MOD files a stop somewhere in the middle
           ?

Deanna7332 That's really frustrating!

AFL JoyceM Mike, leave me E-Mail on when and how I can send your the $$ to
           get it.

AFL JoyceM Again...night all

Nuzz       gee John, I had to do something to explain the delay :)

ELECTMUSIC Thanks Gene for a GREAT chat!

AFC Eddie  Yes, Gene!  Great!

AFA Gene   Thanks Greg, 'night!

AFA Gene   thanx, see y'all later :)

Copyright 1987 Bob Szekely.

    John Michael Osbourne, (known as "Ozzy" to his fans), has in his long 
career as vocalist for Black Sabbath had his work with the group misconstrued 
as advocating Satanism.  In a 1983 radio special featuring Ozzy, the 
interviewer expressed precisely this point; "...Ozzy has always been shrouded 
in the darkest of Satanic imagery.  Yet if you really listen to his music, 
you'll find that what he is saying differs greatly from his image...."(1)  Even 
the group's image has often been described as "occult and diabolic".(2)

    The important point to remember here is to differentiate between appearance 
and reality.  Although the name "Black Sabbath" conjures up images of witches 
and sorcerers paying homage to Satan for the powers bestowed upon them, this 
does not make it safe to assume that the group that went by this name 
necessarily drew the inspiration from the occult.(3)  The closest they ever 
came to it was a gothic horror film featuring Boris Karloff as narrator; they 
adopted their name directly from the name of this film.(4)  Black Sabbath was 
involved in the black arts as much as Karloff practiced casting spells off-
screen.  Tony Iommi, the group's guitarist, summed it up best when he described 
the group as having basically "...the same appeal as a horror movie.  It's all 
an act."(5)










    Just as their film counterpart did, Ozzy and Sabbath found the occult 
mythos to be an effective vehicle for powerful social commentary; particularly 
when put in the context of heavy-metal rock and roll.  Ozzy himself noted that 
there are "...people who pick up my [album] cover[s] and go...'This guy's got 
to be singing about Devil, doom, death and destruction.'  Which is not the 
case...."(6)

    The late Lester Bangs likened the group to Bob Dylan and William Burroughs, 
describing them all as "...moralists...trying to deal with a serious present 
situation in an honest way...."(7)  Ozzy and Black Sabbath merely bring to 
light the many evils of our world in their work, to try and make us realize 
that we are all victim to their influence.  They hope to make us recognize 
these evils so that we may take up arms against them; a point Ozzy emphatically 
stresses:  "...one thing everybody has got to understand about Black Sabbath's 
lyrics.  They're not downer lyrics, they're just telling everybody where it's 
at..."(8)  He also cites the group's most controversial tune, "Black Sabbath", 
as a response to the ignorant hippie culture still force when the tune was 
written in 1970:  "The hippies said: 'The world is beautiful man.' (sic)  You 
only had to look around you to see how crappy it was.  It was ridiculous 
listening to that stuff, let alone playing it, so we just wrote about the world 
the way it really was and how it affected us - and we felt better in ourselves 
because we were really being honest...."(9)

        3   OR PERHAPS YOU THINK THAT WHEN YOU ARE DEAD
        4   YOU JUST STAY IN YOUR GRAVE.
        5   IS GOD JUST A THOUGHT WITHIN YOUR HEAD OR IS
        6   HE A PART OF YOU?
        7   IS CHRIST JUST A NAME THAT YOU READ IN A BOOK
        8   WHEN YOU WERE AT SCHOOL?

    II  9   WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT DEATH DO YOU LOSE
        10  YOUR BREATH OR DO YOU KEEP YOUR COOL?
        11  WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE THE POPE ON THE END

        13  WELL I'VE SEEN THE TRUTH - YES I'VE SEEN

        32  SAY YOU DON'T BELIEVE?
        33  YOU HAD THE CHANCE BUT YOU TURNED IT DOWN
        34  NOW YOU CAN'T RETRIEVE.










    VI  35  PERHAPS YOU'LL THINK BEFORE YOU SAY THAT
        36  GOD IS DEAD AND GONE
        37  OPEN YOUR EYES, JUST REALIZE THAT HE IS THE
        38  ONE.
        39  THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN SAVE YOU KNOW FROM
        40  ALL THIS SIN AND HATE.
        41  OR WILL YOU STILL JEER AT ALL YOU HEAR?
        42  YES!-I THINK IT'S TOO LATE.

    In this piece, the group asserts a belief in an afterlife and spiritual 
redemption.  As grisly as the image of a hanged pontiff is, its shock value is 
a necessary part of the message:  They reject religious dogma, stating that a 
belief in God, in one's own heart, is the only guiding light to help one inn 
his life (lines 11/12, 39/40).  Furthermore, the reject religious hypocrisy 
(lines 5/6, 7/8) and peer pressure (verses III, IV) as excuses for not 
accepting God.  To clarify further:  following the crowd does not justify 
shrugging responsibility for one's own actions.

    After re-reading, it becomes obvious that this song is an ascerbic critique 
of atheism; (line 35/36) I refer here again to verses three and four.  In these 
two verses, the picture painted in one of Godless conformity and how it's 
viewed as being as foolish as Paganism.  These lyrics set an example for the 
listener by relating personal experience (lines 13-16).  However, for those who 
cannot accept this the group has no recourse but to condemn them, although 
rather ironically; they hope that their rhetorical loss of faith in the 
listener will open his eyes (line 42).










                           B L A C K   S A B B A T H 



            WHAT IS THIS, THAT STANDS BEFORE ME?
            FIGURE IN BLACK, WHICH POINTS AT ME
            TURN ROUND QUICK AND START TO RUN
            FIND OUT I'M THE CHOSEN ONE.  OH, NO!
            
            BIG BLACK SHAPE WITH EYES OF FIRE
            TELLING PEOPLE THEIR DESIRE
            SATAN'S SITTING THERE, HE'S SMILING
            WATCHES THOSE FLAMES GET HIGHER AND HIGHER
            OH, NO, NO, -- PLEASE GOD HELP ME!
            
                IS THIS THE END MY FRIEND?
                SATAN'S COMING 'ROUND THE BEND

                THE PEOPLE BETTER GO AND BEWARE
                NO, NO!  PLEASE--NO!!
                
                
    The all time controversy winner!  Is this not irrefutably  THE song about 
Black Magic in rock?  It's all so obvious, suffuse with evil imagery; Satan, 
walls of flame, figure in black, and damnation at the end.  Yes, I see the 
images too; it definitely concerns Black Magic.  Then again, Shakespeare's 
Macbeth employed scenes of witches involved in conjurations; does that mean 
that Shakespeare was a warlock?  Poe used to write sardonic tragedies about 
twisted murderers and the bizarre nature of acts, did that make him an evil, 
leering, demented killer?  Did either of them advocated what they wrote about?  
One has to remember that writing about something is not necessarily the same as 
emulating it.  Tony Iommi spoke out quite strongly about this:  "People are 
bringing us down saying that we are a Black Magic group.  I think they must be










getting mixed up with Black Widow.  We don't do any sacrifices on stage, and 
we're not on a black magic kick.  We wanted to do heavy numbers and the guitar 
riffs we worked out were more suited to evil things than love.  We play songs 
about black magic, but they are more likely to be against than for it."(12)  

    By now, you're probably asking yourself who Black Widow is, right?  Then 
it's time for a little history:

        Sabbath, before they were known as Sabbath, had the same line-up but 
two earlier names.  The first one was Polka Tulk, which seemed sure to doom 
them to obscurity.(13)  The soon realized this and changed the group's name to 
Earth.  Now, Earth was a blues band at the end of the English blues boom.  As 
if that wasn't bad enough, they soon discovered that not only was there another 
group named Earth, but they had also released a single.  To avoid confusion, 
they changed their name again.(14)  But what made them decide on that name?  
Just ask Ozzy:  "I just liked the name Black Sabbath because of the succession 
of vowel sounds.(15)  If that sounds ludicrous just consider this:  Sabbath was 
"...the first of the really committed, loud and heavy bands..."(16)  They 
needed a name to match the gut-wrenching power they were developing.  Tony knew 
that he wanted Sabbath to be noticed above all the rest of the British blues 
bands:  "We wanted something of our own that we'd like and people would like.  
And we wanted something loud!"










    Tony didn't hate the blues.  He'd cut his teeth as a guitarist on the likes 
of The Shadows, Buddy Holly and Django Rheinhardt, developing his own style 
from there.  But he realized the group had no future in the blues:

        'We couldn't keep playing 12-bars forever.  We just got fed up with 
Earth music.  It was jazz, blues stuff.  It was good for practice but nothing 
else.'

    In the late 'Sixties, blues groups were a dime a dozen in Birmingham and 
interest was waning in the blues boom due to the glut of groups.  One man, by 
the name of Jim Simpson, had heard Earth around the Birmingham club circuit and 
understood what they were trying to do.  He decided to take them under his 
wing.  With the aid of his massive record collection, Jim expanded the group's 
horizons in the areas of jazz and blues.  He introduced them to artists like 
Wes Montgomery, Count Basie and Jimmy Rushing.  It was from Rushing in 
particular that they derived the repetitive riff style so readily noticeable in 
their later incarnation as Black Sabbath.

    The Count Basie influence is evidenced in the song "Wicked World" from the 
first album; Sabbath drummer Bill Ward uses a "'sighing hi-hat'...in the manner 
of Basie's drummer Jo Jones."










    The influence is subtle, almost subliminal.  Yet it is one which was not 
thought capable of hard, 'heavy' rock bands in the late 'Sixties.  Although Led 
Zeppelin and Jimi Hendrix also had their work steeped in blues and jazz 
derivations (Hendrix' "Third Stone From the Sun" and Zeppelin's version of 
Willie Dixon's "I Can't Quit You Baby" from their first album), neither was 
able to match the intense energy of Black Sabbath.  Iommi has always had a 
preference for music with an original, distinct style of its' own; as an 
example, he mentions guitarists Joe Pass and Alvin Lee as two of his strongest 
songwriting influences.

    It would also be necessary that Sabbath develop a unique, distinctive style 
and image of their own.  Though they had changed their name from Earth to Black 
Sabbath to avoid confusion with the other Earth; at the same time another group 
emerged by the name of Black Widow "...who WERE profoundly influenced by the 
occult, had a male witch as a patron, and wrote pieces like "Come to The 
Sabbat."  Unfortunately, Sabbath was constantly reaping the benefits of Widow's 
publicity.

    Sabbath was a group that never minced words.  If they saw something as 
destructive, they would be sure to rub the listener's face it it.  They did not 
want their point to be missed.

    With their straightforward, sometimes brutal way of looking at things, they 
try to shock the listener's conscience back into awareness.  The imagery of 
"Hand of Doom", from the Paranoid album, is candid and condemning; it is a 
strong statement against drug addiction and rightly so...

    Many people felt the group's overall direction was pessimistic and had a 
negative effect on its listener's due to that.  "Ozzy insisted that if people 
thought he was having a bad effect on the minds of young kids, they should go 
and watch the TV news where real murder and mayhem were a way of life, and 
shown night after night." (18)

    Sabbath was never negative in their message; they were simply truthful 
about waht they saw as wrong in the world.  If you "Strip away the horror 
stories, the imagery and the hysteria, (and) turn down the amps a notch...you 
have a well-rehearsed, solid blues and rock band, powered by a dedication to 
well defined objectives."  On the top of the list of those objectives was 
truth; Sabbath never feared facing that truth squarely, regardless of what many 
people thought of them.

Long, long, time ago,
I can still remember,
When the local calls were "free".
And I knew if I paid my bill,
And never wished them any ill,
That the phone company would let me be...

But Uncle Sam said he knew better,
Split 'em up, for all and ever!
We'll foster competition:
It's good capital-ism!

I can't remember if I cried,
When my phone bill first tripled in size.
But something touched me deep inside,
The day... Bell System... died.

And we were singing...

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
"Our local calls have us in hock!" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

Is your office Step by Step,
Or have you gotten some Crossbar yet?
Everybody used to ask...
Oh, is TSPS coming soon?
IDDD will be a boon!
And, I hope to get a Touch-Tone phone, real soon...

The color phones are really neat,
And direct dialing can't be beat!
My area code is "low":
The prestige way to go!

Oh, they just raised phone booths to a dime!
Well, I suppose it's about time.
I remember how the payphones chimed,
The day... Bell System... died.

And we were singing...

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
"Our local calls have us in hock!" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

Back then we were all at one rate,
Phone installs didn't cause debate,
About who'd put which wire where...
Installers came right out to you,
No "phone stores" with their ballyhoo,
And 411 was free, seemed very fair!

But FCC wanted it seems,
To let others skim long-distance creams,
No matter 'bout the locals,
They're mostly all just yokels!

And so one day it came to pass,
That the great Bell System did collapse,
In rubble now, we all do mass,
The day... Bell System... died.

So bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
"Our local calls have us in hock!" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

I drove on out to Murray Hill,
To see Bell Labs, some time to kill,
But the sign there said the Labs were gone.
I went back to my old CO,
Where I'd had my phone lines, years ago,
But it was empty, dark, and ever so forlorn...

No relays pulsed,
No data crooned,
No MF tones did play their tunes,
There wasn't a word spoken,
All carrier paths were broken...

And so that's how it all occurred,
Microwave horns just nests for birds,
Everything became so absurd,
The day... Bell System... died.

So bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
"Our local calls have us in hock!" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

We were singing:

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
"Our local calls have us in hock!" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?

And it's good enough for me.        And that's good enough for me.

One-eyed Odin we will follow      We will pray to Zarathustra
And in fighting we will wallow    And we'll pray just like we usta

Which is good enough for me!      And that's good enough for me!

Hare Krishna gets a laugh on         I'll arise at early mornin'
When he sees me dressed in saffron   When the Sun gives me the warnin'

But that's good enough for me!       And that's good enough for me!

We will sing a verse for Eris           Of Great Murphy much is spoken

We will sing for great Diana         If your god of choice is Squat
Who will teach of love and honor     Well then trendy, man, you're not -

'Cause she's tough enough for me!    And that's good enough for me!

We will venerate Bubastis            Call Him God, or call him Allah

I'll sing some songs to Lilith,      Now Danae was sweet as flowers,
Not so young, and not so girlish,    She was into golden showers;
and She's always PMS-ish,            And that showed her Zeus' power
but She's good enough for me!        And that's good enough for me!       
 
And what about this Bacchus,         Diana is a little spikey
Who lives just to raise a ruckus?    And she is a little dyke-ey
Loosens women so they'll f*** us,    You don't have to be a Psych-e
Well, that's good enough for me!     To know that's right for me!

Lilith wears a lacy nightie        That Bob Larson shrieks and hollers
And She is a little flighty        Fighting demons in his callers
She will get you all excite-y      Save his program: SEND YOUR DOLLARS! 
She's wet-dream enough for me!     And that's good enough for me.

              IMPERIUM COMPOUND                                  
                      (Tune: "Lily the Pink")

   Now here's a story, a little bit gory,
   A little bit happy, a little bit sad.
   About a drink called Imperium Compound
   And how the SCA's been had!                       (1)

   Chorus: Oh we think, we think, we think,
           The King is a fink, a fink, a fink,
           A figure of respectability
           Rules the Kingdom thru Imperium Compound
           The results are plain to see!

   Duke Treegirtsea, was known for his courtesy,
   And his fighting prowess was well-renowned
   Took a thimble of Imperium Compound
   And the poor Duke nearly drowned!                  (2)

   Words with Andy, you never should bandy
   He is strong enough to kill a moose
   He drinks copious Imperium Compound
   But he can't take Jungle Juice!                    (2)

   Meriwold, he's the bane of a Skald, he
   Has no attributes of which to sing
   Polite and formal, incredibly normal,
   Are you SURE he was the King?                       (3)

   Bearengaer(y) he lived solitary,
   From his presence folks would hide in fear
   Dipped his blade in Imperium Compound
   And now we're stuck with him this year!

   And today she is a nun   \\ not better!\\               (19)

   There's good old Igor, his prowess is meager
   For he never learned to water-ski!
   But instead he drinks Imperium Compound
   Then he howls and climbs a tree!  \\Hoo Hah!\\          (19)

   Then there's Dagan, his brother's the Ka-Khan,
   Which is quite funny in a King!
   If he gets hooked on Imperium Compound
   There'll be new songs to sing!    \\ Oh, really?\\       (19)  

   Fredrick of Holland, who dwells in the Northland,
   A Master from the West, he came!
   Spends all his money for Imperium Compound
   That's why his garb's always the same!                   (20)

   Now Gyrth Oldcastle, round as a beer barrel,
   Once chose to quarrel with a certain Bard;
   The poet served him with Imperium Compound,
   And left him rendered down to lard!                      (20)

   Many tales abound of Imperium Compound
   And its' strange effects on Royalty,
   But after an hour, this song has no power,
   And by now, it's boring ME!                             (16)

   Duchess Malinda, who doesn't do windas
   But she does a lot of Duchess Things,
   But give her a LOT of Imperium Compound,
   And she sings and sings and sings and sings and sings!   (5)

   AltChorus: Oh it's too long, too long, too long
              To sing the whole song, the song, the song
              Longer than a Royal Court, it is!
              But sing it serial, this ditty Imperial
              And you'll be a bardic whiz!                 (5)

                                             IMPERIUM COMPOUND    
                                             (Atenveldt Verses)

   Now here's a story, a little bit gory,
   A little bit happy, a little bit sad.
   About a drink called Imperium Compound
   And how the SCA's been had!                       

   Chorus: Oh we think, we think, we think,
           The King is a fink, a fink, a fink,
           A figure of respectability
           Rules the Kingdom thru Imperium Compound
           The results are plain to see!

   Mongol Hordemen, those free-living swordsmen
   Subverting the Kingdoms from underneath!
   Have no use for Imperium Compound
   Except perhaps to brush their teeth!

   AltChorus: Oh we fink, we fink, we fink,
              The Khan and the Kink, the Kink, the Kink,
              And the Board, their Great Senilities!
              The Western Irgun, drinks Imperium Compound
              And we're BACK, with results you'll see!    

   Lady Laurel, with Authority Royal,
   Passes and rejects our heraldry
   She needs a swig of Imperium Compound
   Then perhaps she'd deign to talk to me!            

   Lady Trude thought it her duty
   To turn a social wrong into a Right
   Proved her point with Imperium Compound
   And showed that Cheshire Cats can fight!  //and scratch//

   The Board of Directors styled themselves The Electors
   And another con they tried to swing
   Now the BoD drinks Imperium Compound
   So we no longer need a King!                        

   AltChorus: Oh the Bod, the BoD, the BoD,
              It thinks it is God, is God, is God,
              The figure of Supreme Authority!
              And if we O.D.'d on Imperium Compund
              there'd be no need for Royalty!          

   Oh, MEDIEVAL Net, we thought it was all wet
   With witty remarks, and other kinds of sass
   We'll feed our computers on Imperium Compound
   And BYTE the BoD right on its' righteous ass!         

   Good old Duncan was often drunken
   Chasing all the ladies fair
   He bathed himself in Imperium Compound
   Now he has a little savoir faire!                     

                    (more)


  ATEN IMPERIUM (cont.)

   Ioseph of Locksley, never changes his socks, he
   Runs around looking like a Cavalier,
   He stocked up on Imperium Compound
   And he has enough to last for years and years!        

   AltChorus: Oh they forgot, forgot, forgot
              The Locks-e-ly Plot, the Plot, the Plot!
              And it works the best when it is underground!
              It isn't a hassle for a green-and-white tassle
              They're the ones that BREW Imperium Compound!  

   Trelon of the Wood, he was very good, he
   Was a leader that had never been beat before;
   But Caid had Imperium Compound,
   And Imperial Roman Caid won the War!  //with help!//   

   In Tyr Ysgithr, it's regularly whispered there
   That the Kingdom is ruled over by a King    // What's THAT? //
   They're "democratic" and quite erratic....
   They've forgot the purpose of the whole damn thing!     

   King Sir Mark von, with his pretty white suit on,
   Rules the Kingdom both with Grace and Purity!
   He never touches Imperium Compound
   At least not where anyone else can see!               

   Duke Sir Deaton, was never beaten
   On the field, or in the drinking hall;
   At the Catbox War with Caid,
   Left thirty bodies piled against the wall!             

   Denis O'Titans was good at smitin'
   A Locksley Monster in every single way!
   Drank a little Imperium Compound
   And ATE Deaton's sword that day  // No! REALLY! //       

   Wotan the Mongoloid, a little bit paranoid,
   But a nice guy none the less;
   Drank a mess of Imperium Compound
   Now he's Justin du Roc, I confess!                       

   Then there's Duke Reynard, with a face like a St. Bernard
   Of the Dukes, he is the homliest
   He tends to toke up on Imperium Compound
   And go out and whomp on anybody's best!                   

   This song'll bedevil the folks at a revel,
   And most of the time it will annoy the King,
   So take a drink of Imperium Compound
   And let's go Royalty-bedeviling!                        

   Duchess Anna is quite a fan-a
   Going on a wartime shopping spree!  \\ War Point!\\
   Took a drink of Imperium Compound
   And shopped so fast we couldn't see! \\ Z-o-o-o-om!\\    (5)

                     (more)


  ATEN IMPERIUM (Cont.)

   Lyn of Whitewolfe, made of the right stuff,
   Twice the Queen of Atenveldt;
   Took a drink of Imperium Compound
   And the Kingdom of Caid before her knelt!              

   Duke Sir Brion, and Duke Sir Trelon,
   Won the Crown with regularity;
   Drank a lot of Imperium Compound,
   And founded a dynasty!                                 

   Stephan von Geist, was most awful nice,
   And a chivalrous fighter without any doubt
   Took a swig of Imperium Compound
   And won the Crown his first time out!                    

   All the Crusadenes were big, but not mean,
   And the finest fighters in the town.
   But they all drank Jerusalem Compound,
   Winning Crown after Crown after Crown!                 

   Good Duke Arthur couldn't get no farth-er
   A Norman King in Aten Land
   Drank too much of Imperium Compound
   And went off to conquer Engel-land!                    

   Then King Richard, a bit of a bitch, heard
   A King's Crown could be done.
   Drank a little Imperium Compound
   And became the Aten King, first one!                    

   Duchess Malinda, who doesn't do windas,
   But she does a lot of Duchess Things,
   But give her a LOT of Imperium Compound,
   And she sings and sings and sings and sings and sings!   

   Duke Sir Brion, with his pretty white suit on,
   Is a model of goodness and purity
   Never touches Imperium Compound
(spoken:) And I'll sell ya seashore property in Yuma, too!  

   Optional last verse:

   Many tales abound of Imperium Compound
   And its' strange effects on Royalty,
   But after an hour, this song has no power,
   And by now, it's boring ME!                            

   AltChorus: Oh it's too long, too long, too long
              To sing the whole song, the song, the song
              Longer than a Royal Court, it is!
              But sing it serial, this ditty Imperial
              And you'll be a bardic whiz!

                          WTP-0002C

        Last night I had the strangest dream in this bleak century
        I dreamed that people the world around believed in Chivalry

        I dreamed I saw a Kingly Crown enshrined in laurel leaves
        with Grace and Joy and Purity attendant at his feet

        I dreamed I saw the perfect Knight receive his accolade
        and minstrels sang and children laughed in some soft forest glade

        I dreamed I saw the finest thing that ever man could make
        grow great and strong and undefiled: Pray God I never wake!

        Last night I had the strangest dream in this bleak century
        I dreamed that people the world around believed in Chivalry

               (to the tune of "Good King Wenceslaus")

                Locksley Monsters never yield
                on the field of battle
                strike the helm and bash the shield
                make their eyeteeth rattle
                Bodies on the ground will lie
                bones will burst in sunder
                search for Locksleys' enemies:
                You'll find them six feet under!

                              SONG OF IVANOF

            There is a man who we know well that does the best he can
            but he's displayed in armour made of reticulated garbage cans!

            He looks so fine and fair and strong, oh how he plays the man
            and how it's prized, those galvanized, reticulated garbage cans

            The noblest Roman of them all, a good Praetorian
            a combatant who wears no pants, judst reticulated garbage cans!

            Like old Horatius at the Bridge, like the Legions of Valerian
            (O dearie me: those LOVELY knees!)
            and those reticulated garbage cans!

                         C. McCray Bethancourt

         (sung to the tune (obviously) of the 12 Days of Christmas)


1.           The first time I sent my device, The Heralds said to me

            "It violates the Rule of Three"

2.           The next time I tried it, the Heralds said to me

            "We changed the forms, and it violates the Rule of
             Three".

3.           The third time I tried, and the Heralds said to me, 

            "We upped the fees, we changed the forms, and it
             violates the Rule of Three".

4.           Another time I tried and the Heralds said to me,
 
            "We haven't got it, we upped the fees, we changed the 
             forms, and it violates the Rule of Three".

5.           The fifth time I tried it, the Heralds said to me,  

            "In a decision rendered by the College of Arms on
             August 1st, A.S. V it was decided that this style of
             heraldic design was not appropriate to the aims and 
             intentions of the Corporate Body. Holy! Holy! Holy! "

 note: verse 5 is delivered in an extremely fast, mono-
       tone, similiar to a Gregorian Chant.

           " ....we haven't got it, we upped the fees, we changed the forms,
             and it violates the Rule of Three."

6.           I tried it a sixth time, and the Heralds said to me,

            "We changed the rules, &c"

7.           A seventh time I tried and, the Heralds said to me,

            "It's against the Rule of Tincture, we changed the
             rules, &c"

8.           I tried it once again and the heralds said to me,

            "It's not a Period design, It's against the Rule of Tincture, We
             changed the rules, &c"

                                * more *



    Heralds Said To Me (cont.)

9.           I sent it in once more, and the Heralds said to me,

            "We changed the rules again, It's not a Period design,
             it's against the Rule of Tincture, we changed the
             rules, &c"

10. (sung in cold anger)
             The LAST time I sent my device, the Heralds said to me

    (sung in a state of SMUG)
             "Someone else has got it, &c"




              (nb: every single one of these reasons has been used by the
              CoA, at one point or another, to reject perfectly good
              heraldry, along with some even MORE stupid.  If the shoe 
              fits....................!!!!!!!!)

                        BUGS ON THE BARONESS
                        Tune: Waltzing Matilda
 
           or: Who was that Vermin I saw you with last, Knight?
   or: There may be Lice on all you Knice, but there ain't no Lice on me

           Once there was a Barony howling in the wilderness
           nestled in the Valley where the River doesn't flow
           and the folks were driven buggy by the insects in the Revel Hall
           Authenticity is wonderful, but this doesn't go!

                   Bugs on the Baroness, bugs on the Baroness!
                   That was the cry that you heard all the day
                   and the scratching can be heard from Ysgithr to Ered Sul
                   why did we come here? Let's go away!

           See them all a scratching, nestled in their armour tight
           the fleas have a melee team that's challenging the field!
           call Truly Nolen! Someone's gotta help us out!
           the crabs are nesting in our helms but we'll never yield!

                   (chorus)

           Dawn comes a-breaking, the bugs have won the Coronet...
           flea-infested Conan-clones in piles upon the lawn
           where is the Barony? The bugs have eaten everyone...
           termites got the stick-jocks, and all their sticks are gone!

                   (chorus)

                          ATENVELDT
                          tune: The West's Awake

                  For all the Lands where I have dwelt
                  Oh Atenveldt, Oh Atenveldt
                  till rivers burn and mountains melt
                  lest I forget my Atenveldt
                  From deserts stark to snow-capped peaks
                  from silent lakes and laughing creeks
                  sing: Oh let man find his heart's ease
                  on rocky plains
                  in desert breeze

                  For oft I thought of mighty men
                  who carved a Land with sword and pen
                  and lit a candle, burning bright,
                  that pierced the darkness; stirred the night!
                  tho some are gone their deeds remain
                  this sunny Crown without a stain
                  sing: Oh, their deeds were not in vain!
                  in sunlit days
                  and falling rain.....

                  So raise your banners, blazoned bright
                  Advance the Dream and Shine the Light!
                  in battle's crash and Revel's song
                  raise high the Flag and wave it long!
                  For all the Lands wherein I've dwelt
                  I love you best, my Atenveldt!
                  Sing: Oh the Joy that I have felt!
                  My Atenveldt
                  My Atenveldt

      What the use of wearing panties
      whalebone corsets of your Auntie's
      boxer shorts and other scanties
      best of all is nude
      there's such fun in going bra-less
      now that it's no longer lawless
      'specially if your figure's flawless
      best of all is nude
      nude is what you're born in
      shirts are never torn in
      underwear and lacy flimsies, garter belts and other whimsies
      yards of itchy cloth to put your form in
      ducks all do it, maidens rue it
      even ancient Picts in Britain blue it
      going naked's how to do it
      best of all is nude!

      If your garters aren't elastic
      tie them up in knots fantastic
      (panty hose is something drastic!)
      best of all is nude!
      If you're tired of wearing clotheses
      shed your garment 'mongst the roses
      never mind the old bluenoses
      best of all is nude!
      Nude is best for ducking!
      Worst for horses bucking!
      Moonlit nights will see such sights
          that are very best for fooling round
                              .....and elbows!
      Nudity is grand to see
       a well-known antidote to virginity
      take your clothes off and you'll see:
      best of all is nude!

                   Hi said the Norn, sittin in the sand
                   once I talked to a great Grey Man
                   spun three times and said with a sigh
                   hadn't been for the Runes had his other eye!

                   Chorus: hi diddle i diddle i day
                           hi diddle i diddle i diddle ay

                   Hi said the Lady, dressed in green
                   prettiest thing I've ever seen
                   she went down underneath the hill
                   and came back out of her own free will

                   Brian Boru, on Irish ground
                   walked three times the Island round
                   Norsemen came lookin for a fight
                   just another Irish Saturday night!

                   Hi said Lugh on the banquest night
                   a poet and a player and a good wheelwright
                   a harper and a warrior and none the least:
                   a Druid and he got in to the Feast!

                   Harold Haardrada's face was red!
                   Came to Britain and he wound up dead
                   Stamford Bridge is where he's found
                   got six feet of English ground

                   the Legion with it's Eagles bright
                   marched into the Pictish night
                   met them there upon the sand
                   gave em up to the Wicker Man!

                   eight-legged steed and hound of Hel
                   the one-eyed Man, he loves ya well
                   fire burn and fire spark
                   are you then feared of the dark?

                   The Circle forms, the Circle flows
                   the Circle goes where no man knows
                   Hail to the Lady, one in three:
                   Present is Past and Past is Me!

                   Rhiannon's Birds are still in flight
                   all thru the Day all thru the Night
                   Hail to the Lady, one in Three
                   Present is Past and Past is Thee!

                   Celtic Circle Dance (cont.)

                   Hi said the Lady dressed in white
                   sang the Day and sang the Night
                   sang the Land and sang the Sea
                   sang the Song, and then sang Me!

                   (extra verses) Salt and oil and mirror bright
                                  fire and fleet and candlelight

                                  fill the cup and blessed be!

                                  From the misty crystal sea
                                  came the Lady to the lea
                                  Sword and Roses in Her Hand
                                  spread their seeds thruout the Land

                                  Came the Stag from oaken wood
                                  saw the Lady where she stood
                                  by the fire burning bright
                                  came to know his heart's delight!

                   (end of extra verses)

                   Blessed Be: the Day I've found

                   Present is Past and Past is WE

                   By Oak and Ash and Holy Thorn
                   bledded be the Day you're born!

               I'll tell you a tale of Peace and Love
                       whack fol the diddle o the di do day
               Of those that Rule all Lands above

               may Peace, and Plenty be their share
               that keep our Empire in repair

               When we were Sauvage, Fierce and Wilde
               they came as a Mother to her childe
               they gently raised us from the slime
               and kept our hands from Hellishe Crime
               and made us a Kingdom in their own good time

               Now, Atenveldt forgets the Past
               and thinks on a Day that's coming fast
               when we shall all be....civilized....(puke)
               neat, and clean.....and WELL-ADVISED
               oh won't the Directors be....suprised?!

        Away out here they have a name for even the Ump that's Wuggly

                M'Lady, M'Lady, they call the pigs M'Lady!

        Before I knew M'Lady's name and heard her constant whinin'
        I thought all girls were beautiful and the sun was always shinin'

        Then one day, M'Lady came, and stopped the clocks from tickin'
        she curdled milk, aborted cows, and stopped my stamps from stickin'!

                (chorus)

        Away out here they have a name for everything worth seein'

        M'Lady disappeared one day, and that for sure is scary
        she was the result of experiments by a deranged Vetinary!

                    WEAPONS AT THE DOOR

 Being a Polemic concerning the alleged Custom of the West Kingdom concerning 
 checking your Weapons at the Door of the Revel Hall. As the Satire is the 
 Weapon of the Bard, this said Polemic is to be checked at the Door, along with 
 swords, knives, redheaded Ladies and other such Deadly Things.....

         As I roved out to Western Lands to take the Western Air
         I went into a Revel Hall and I saw a Twelfth Night there
         but I was halted at the gate by a Privy Consellor
                 (that's the man who tells the King of the West how to go to
                  the bath room!)
         who told me I would have to check my Weapons at the door

         As I, in my astonishment, stood hung on tenter-pegs
         a Knight came in whose Prouess hung down between his legs
         the Doorman grabbed a greatsword and he struck the Knight full sore
         and gave him a reciept; he left his weapon at the door!

         a Bard was next whose goodly Voice has entertained us all
         but he, too, was prevented from entering the Hall
         and told he could not carry deadly weapons on the floor
         he left his Voice and Harp among the weapons at the door

         a Master entered graciously, a man we all know well
         who holds a 3rd Dan Black Belt, tho this he'd never tell
         the Master struggled valiantly, the Master cursed and swore
         but he left his hands, and feet, as weapons at the door

         the company was jovial, altho a bit dismayed
         for lack of proper cutlery, down to the smallest blade
         for even teeth and fingernails, each can be used in War
         were cut, and pulled, and left behind, as weapons at the door!

         And has their King not loyal Knights that He must be afraid
         of brawling in his Hall and of Assassin's bloody blade?
         the Rights of Men to carry Arms at least WE'VE not foreswore
         and a POX on them that made the Rule of Weapons at the Door!

                           THE STREETS OF ANN ARBOR

               As I walked out thru the streets of Ann Arbor
               as I walked out thru Ann Arbor one day
               I spied a young Mongol all dressed in white linen
               all dressed in white linen and cold as the clay

               I then spied another, done in on the sidewalk
               along with just about six dozen more
               their wounds were all gaping, from mace and from braoadsword
               from claymore and cannon, all dripping with gore

               what caused this grave carnage, I cried to the Monglos
               oh pray what's the reason for this awful sight
               my answer came slowly from under the corpse-pile
               "It seems that our bark is much worse than our bite....."

               the answer continued from pale lips a-shaking
               we sang all our songs and believed them as true
               the Dark Horde could never be beaten in battle
               we thought this was what all good Mongols could do...

               we went down to Atenveldt all for to plunder
               "too large to defend" was our song every night
               but Atenveldt's different from East, West or Middle
               there, even the bushes have learned how to bite!

               the Clann stole our ponies, the Scraelings our foodstuffs
               we ran into axes in AtenViking hands
               our maidens ran off with one Richard of Arkham
               and we're all that's left to return to our lands

               MacChluarains and Monsters, Lockehaven and Foxmoor
               that Kingdom is BIG and its' fighters are MEAN!
               we fought and we lost, and fled back to Ann Arbor
               we all came back home with results that you've seen

               keep away from that Land with its' cactus and marshes
               it's no place for Mongols who are bent on War
               they count their blows well, but they strick them yet better
               he crawled into his Yurt, and fell, dead, on the floor.....

                            C. A. Bethancourt III
       tune: the song of the Cowardly Lion, Tin Woodsman and Scarecrow
             in the movie version of the Wizard of Oz

        (Enter the Scarecrow, who singeth:)

        My wife is always nagging; my Prowess it is lagging
        I can't do anything
        she has got a reason, but revenge is out of season
        Oh I wish I could be King!

        If I just had the Crown on, I'd always have a frown on
        and the Barons on a string
        Heads they would be rolling, the Board would be cajoling
        Oh if only I was King!

        I am very fed up with the way this group is set up
        Oh I'd change everything!
        they are so high and mighty with the way that they do fight-ey
        Oh, someday I'll be King!

        Tho my wife is melancholic, and very...vitriolic
        she's a wasp without a sting!
        I'd have to supervise her with a pack of tranquilizers
        If I only was a King......

        (the Tin Woodsman joineth him, and singeth:)

        I grew up kind of cocky, and rather big, and stocky
        and straight as any rod
        on the field I'm a battallion, with the Ladies I'm a stallion
        ...Oh they'd better make me God!

        The other boys are jealous they say I'm over-zealous
        they'd do better to applaud
        the things that I am giving to this Dream that we are living
        oh I wish they'd make me God!

        They say that I'm conceited, but I'm just badly treated
        by people and by BoD
        just think of what they're missing by My Majesty dismissing
        Oh they'd better make me God!

        (the Cowardly Lion creepeth forth, and singeth:)

        Oh I could be a fighter, a great and mighty smiter
        and be the perfect knight
        it's a great and nasty shame, and everyone's to blame
        oh I wish that I could fight!

        Song of the Three (cont.)

        I could be a Cavalier drinking wine and ale and beer
        and be a gorgeous sight
        but it would cost me too much money so it isn't very funny
        oh I wish that I could fight!                               

        Let me at 'em on the field, I would surely make them yield
        to my Power and my Might
        with rattan, shinai and rapier they would nevermore escape here
        If they'd only let me fight

                  And in her apartment she wanted to stay!

                One day in the Kingdom of the Middle
                It happened at a Tourney one day:
                The Mongols invaded the Middle
                But the Middle did not want to play...

                  (eins - zwei - drei, but the Dark Horde wouldn't die!)

                  It was an itsy bitsy tiny teenie Nauseating Mongol weenie
                  That they saw, for the first time, that day.
                  An itsy bitsy tiny teenie Nauseating Mongol weenie
                  And the Mongols did NOT go away!

                Now the Heralds made up a new Rulebook
                And to read it is some kind of gas!
                It's a bureaucrat's dream, this new Rulebook
                Now NOBODY'S blazon can pass!

                      by William Poundstone
                              1983

     Two mentalities are at work here: 1960s rock fans and 1980s
fundamentalist Christians. The idea of phonographically concealed
messages dates from the Paul McCartney death scare of 1969. For
hard-core types, the secret-message rumors never really died. Avid
rock fans have auditioned ever album release since the late 1960s
for hidden nuances. Backward messages, barely audible messages,
and messages on one stereo track only have been alleged. At the
other end of the sociosensual spectrum, fundamentalist Christians
have gotten into the act. TV programs such as PRAISE THE LORD and
THE 700 CLUB have propagated rumors of a satanic plot in the
recording industry, no less, in which various albums conceal
"backward-masked" demonic murmurings. If THAT sounds too spacey to
be taken seriously, consider that it was the fundamentalist groups
who were behind House Resolution 6363, a bill introduced in the
U.S. House of Representatives by Robert K. Dornan (R., Calif.) in
1982 to label all suspect records: "WARNING: THIS RECORD CONTAINS
BACKWARD MASKING THAT MAKES A VERBAL STATEMENT WHICH IS AUDIBLE
WHEN THIS RECORD IS PLAYED BACKWARD AND WHICH MAY BE PERCEPTIBLE
AT A SUBLIMINAL LEVEL WHEN THIS RECORD IS PLAYED FORWARD." In
February 1983, the Arkansas State Senate passed a similar record-
labeling bill by a vote of 86 to 0.
     Contributing to the quasi-occult status of these rumors is
the difficulty of checking them out on home audio equipment. You
pretty much have to take someone else's word for it, or dismiss
the rumors out of hand.
     From a technical standpoint, there are four simple ways to
conceal a verbal message on a recording. The most obvious is to
record the message at a very low volume. The message may then be
recovered by turning the volume up while playing the record or
tape. If the message is faint enough, though, noise levels of home
equipment may garble it. If the accompanying music or lyrics are
loud enough, or if the message itself is indistinct or
electronically modified, it may be hard to hear on any equipment.
     A second gimmick is to record a message on one stereo track
only. Records and tapes have two independent recordings, of
course, normally played simultaneously for stereo effect. On a
record, each stereo track occupies on one side of the V-shaped
groove for the needle. On a tape, the tracks are recorded in
parallel lanes of the magnetic material. The two tracks are called
"right" and "left" after the stereo speakers they will play on.
Otherwise, the tracks are interchangeable -- the sound mixer can
put anything he or she wants on each track. A message on one track
can be masked by simultaneous loud music or lyrics on the opposite
track. With normal stereo balance (or mono equipment) the loud
track drowns out the message track. At home, single-track messages
can be recovered by adjusting the stereo balance so that only the
desired track plays. Sometimes this trick also makes indistinct
words clearer. Even if the words are not exclusively on one track,
they may happen to be more audible on one track.
     A message could be recorded at a speed different from the
rest of the record. Then the record would have to be played faster
or slower than usual to recover the message. Unless the message
was at one of the standard speeds (say, 45 rpm on a 33 1/3 rpm
record), it could not be played normally on home equipment.
     The fourth and most commonly alleged trick is to record a
verbal message backward. Reversed speech has several unexpected
features. One is that syllables are not a constant in the reversal
process. A one-syllable word can have two or three syllables when
played backward. Thus "number nine" in the Beatles' REVOLUTION 9
reverses to "Turn me on, dead man" (or something like it), a jump
from three to five syllables.
     There is no simple way to predict what a word or phrase will
sound like reversed. Obviously, you can't just reverse the
letters.
     Reversed messages are difficult to recover at home. Record
turntables are not built to go backwards. Some have a neutral
setting, in which the pickup and amplifier remain active and you
can turn the record backward by hand. But hardly anyone has a
stead enough hand to produce satisfactory results.
     With patience, it is possible to reverse a cassette
recording. Transfer the music from the original record or tape
onto a blank tape cassette. Place the cassette flat on a table.
Draw our the part of the tape with the suspected message and snip
it off at both ends. Hold the tape segment horizontally. Rotate it
180 degrees, keep it horizontal at all times. This turns the tape
end for end. Splice the reversed tape segment back onto the two
loose ends of the cassette with strong adhesive tape. Reel the
tape back inside the cassette. The sliced segment will play
backward on an ordinary cassette player.
     I rented a recording studio to test the secret-message
rumors. New copiies of the records in question were transcribed on
a quarter-inch master tape. Where rumor alleged that a single
stereo track contained a message, right and left stereo tracks
were transcribed separately. Records with alleged inaudible
messages were treated similarly. To test claims of reversed
messages, recordings on the master tape were edited out and
spliced in backward. Twenty cuts or portions of cuts from sixteen
albums were tested.


"Another One Bites the Dust"
Queen, THE GAME

Rumor: When played backward, the lyrics say, "It's fun to smoke
marijuana."
Findings: There is something that sounds like "It's fun to smoke
marijuana" in the reversed music. It is repeated over and over. It
might be rendered no less faithfully, however, as "sfun to scout
mare wanna." This "message" is the reversal of the song title,
which is repeated as a line in the song.
     Let's make a distinction between engineered and phonetic
reversals. When an artist records a verbal statement, reverses it
by turning the tape end for end, mixes the reversed statement onto
a master tape, and has records and tapes produced from the master,
that is an engineered reversal. When the phonetic properties of
song lyrics are such that they can be reversed to sound like
something else, that is a phonetic reversal.
     "It's fun to smoke marijuna" is clearly a phonetic reversal.
The lyrics are perfectly plain played forward ("Another one bites
the dust"), no so plain played backward ("sfun to scout mare
wanna"). With an engineered reversal, the opposite should hold
true: gibberish forward, clear as a bell backward. Some are
prepared to believe that phonetic reversals are just as
intentional as engineered reversals -- that the songwriter
painstakinginly planned the phonetic double-entendre. In the
absence of confirming evidence, that just doesn't wash. It's too
easy to find coincidences. If, for example, the letters of the
alphabet are recited in conventional fashion (Ay, Bee, Cee, etc.)
and reversed, at least five sound like English language words. D
reverses to "eden," F becomes "pray," S becomes "say," V becomes
"even," and Z becomes "easy." "It's fun to smoke marijuana" is
likewise a coincidence.


"A Child is Coming"
Jefferson Starship, BLOWS AGAINST THE EMPIRE

Rumor: When played backward, "son of Satan."
Findings: Another phonetic coincidence. The repeated "It's getting
better" reverses to an iffy "son of Satan," the "of" drawn out and
the "Satan" strongly accented on the first syllable.


"Eldorado"
Electric Light Orchestra, ELDORADO

Rumor: When played backward, "He is the nasty one/ Christ, you're
infernal/ It is said we're dead men/ Everyone who has the mark
will live."
Findings: Coincidence. The supposed message lurks around the line
"On a voyage of no return to see." Reversed, this passage becomes
the expected syllable salad -- no one hearing it would describe it
as anything but reversed music. Only if you listen while reading
along with what you're supposed to hear will you get anything. The
rumored version of the message is somewhat fudged. The passage
sounds more like "He's to nasty one/ Christ you are, Christ,
you're fernal/ There wiss uh, we're dead men..." There is no "in"
in what is taken to be "infernal." The line that is supposed to be
"Everyone who has the mark will live" isn't even close, though the
syllable count is right.


"Shoo Be Doo"
The Cars, CANDY-O

Rumor: When played backward, the word "Satan" repeated
approximately eleven times.
Findings: Coincidence. The rumor refers to the reversal of the "Shoo
be doo, shoo be doo, shoo be doo..." near the end of the song. Given
the mysterious logic of reversed phonemes, these three-syllable units
can be hard as a repeated two-syllable word. The word sounds a little
like "Satan."


"Snowblind"
Styx, PARADISE THEATER

Rumor: According to a mimeographed list of suspect records distributed
by Congressman Dornan, the words "Satan move through our voices" when
played backwards.
Findings: Negative. Despite repeated listenings, it was not even
possible to identify the part of the reversed track that Dornan et al.
are talking about.


"Stairway to Heaven"
Led Zeppelin, untitled, a.k.a. STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN

Rumor: In reverse, "I live for Satan... The Lord turns me off...
There's no escaping it... Here's to my sweet Satan... There's power in
Satan... He will give you 666."
Findings: Coincidence. If you listen very carefully to the "And it
makes me wonder" lines in reverse, you'll hear something approaching
"There's no escaping it." A better description is "There's no escape
do." Knock of the last syllable, and you have "There's no escape," a
complete, intelligible sentence in reverse. It's there, all right, but
it's not an unlikely enough coincidence to -- well, make you wonder.
      The "Satan" in "I live for Satan" is good and clear. The "I live
for" part isn't. The other alleged lines are unremarkable. All are
phonetic reversals of the entirely lucid forward lyrics and obviously
just accidents.


"When Electricity Came to Arkansas"
Black Oak Arkansas, BLACK OAK ARKANSAS and RONCH AND ROLL

Rumor: In reverse, "Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan. He is God. He
is God."
Findings: The BLACK OAK ARKANSAS cut was reversed. Again, pairs of
reversed syllables are being freely interpreted as "Satan." "He is
God" was not identifiable.


"Rain"
The Beatles, HEY JUDE

Rumor: Unintelligible lyrics at the end are reversed.
Findings: A true engineered reversal and not really a secret. "Rain"
seems to have been the first popular recording to incorporate an
obviously reversed lyric. The story is that John Lennon accidentally
spliced the last part of the song in backward and liked the effect.
When reversed, the strange-sounding vocals at the end become
intelligible as a reprise starting with the drawn-out word
"sunshine."
      The reversal is less apparent to the casual listener than it
might be because the accompanying music is not reversed. The ending
fits in smoothly with the rest of the song, the vocals suggesting a
foreign language.


"Fire on High"
Electric Light Orchestra, FACE THE MUSIC

Rumor: When played backward, "The music is reversible, but time --
turn back!"
Findings: "Fire on High" is instrumental. About twenty-six seconds
into the music, scrambled speech is heard. It is mostly louder than
the accompanying music and begins with a two-syllable unit repeated
several times. The seeming speech lasts for about fourteen seconds.
      Reversing the music confirms that there is a true, engineered
message. In reverse, a voice (Jeff Lynne's?) says, "The music is
reversible, but time -- turn back! Turn back! Turn back! Turn back!"
All the words are clear and unambiguous. Anyone comparing this to the
alleged reversal on ELO's "Eldorado" will have no trouble telling
which is genuine.


"Goodbye Blue Sky"
Pink Floyd, THE WALL

Rumor: In reverse, "You have discovered the secret message."
Findings: The "secret message" is at the very end of the instrumental
passage following the "Goodbye Blue Sky" vocals. It comes just before
the words "What shall we do" at the start of the song that is
identified as "Empty Spaces" on the record label and as "What shall we
do now?" on the record sleeve. Played forward, the message is less
apparent than the FACE THE MUSIC reversal: A reasonably attentive
listener might play THE WALL through and not catch it. It suggests
speech not quite close enough to be overheard. In context this is not
unusual because the "Goodbye Blue Sky" instrumental passage includes
"airport noises" and other sound effects. A loud climax in the music
further masks the unintelligible voice.
      When played backward, the voice (Roger Waters?) plainly intones,
"Congratulations, you have just discovered the secret message. Please
send your answer to old Pink, care of the funny farm..." As the voice
fades out, there may be another word -- perhaps "Chalfonte or
"Chelsea" -- after "funny farm."


"Heavy Metal Poisoning"
Styx, KILROY WAS HERE

Rumor: A red sticker on the KILROY WAS HERE cover warns, "By order of
the Majority for Musical Morality, this album contains secret backward
messages..."
Findings: This is a case of second-generation backward-masking. Styx'
PARADISE THEATER did not contain a backward message, though a lot of
people said it did. So Styx has included a sure enough backward
message on KILROY WAS HERE. It is at the very beginning of "Heavy
Metal Poisoning." The reversed speech last about three seconds. There
is no musical background. The words reverse to "Annuit coeptis. Novus
ordo seclorum." This is the Latin motto encircling the pyramid on the
back of a dollar bill. The usual translation: "God has favored our
undertakings. A new order of the ages."
      The cover sticker's "Majority for Musical Morality" is a
fictitious Falwellesque group in the KILROY WAS HERE video. Although
the sticker suggests a plurality of "messages," only one was found.


Space between "I'm So Tired" and "Blackbird"
The Beatles, untitled, a.k.a. THE WHITE ALBUM

Rumor: A reversed message. At the time of the Paul-is-dead stories,
the segue from "I'm So Tired" to "Blackbird" was offered as evidence.
It was held to contain John Lennon's voice, reveresed, saying "Paul is
dead, miss him, miss him, miss him." That interpretation seems
unlikely now, but there is a mysterious low muttering between the
songs.
Findings: The mumbling is actually just to the "I'm So Tired" side of
the shiny "space" between cuts on the record. Each of the stereo
tracks was recorded separately, twice, and a copy of each track was
reversed. This produced four versions of the two-second passage: right
forward, left forward, right reversed, and left reversed. All were
equally unintelligible. It was not even apparent whether the voice is
forward or reversed. Nor could John Lennon be identified as the
speaker. There are nine or ten syllables. The first six (when played
forward) are a two-syllable unit repeated three times. There is little
or no difference betwen the stereo tracks. Any claimed interpretation
of the sounds seems doubtful.


"Strawberry Fields Forever"
The Beatles, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR

Rumor: It was, of course, claimed that John Lennon says "I buried
Paul" at the end. (It's forward, at the very end after the music
fades to complete silence, returns, and starts to fade out again.)
But Lennon told ROLLING STONE that the words are "cranberry
sauce."
Findings: They are "cranberry sauce." The "sauce"/"Paul" part is
indistinct, but the first syllable sounds a lot more like "cran"
than "I."


"Baby You're a Rich Man"
The Beatles, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR

Rumor: On one of the tracks the line "Baby you're a rich man too"
is sung as "Baby you're a rich fag Jew," a dig at Brian Epstein.
Or some think it's "rich fat Jew" and claim it as evidence of
Beatle anti-Semitism.
Findings: Negative. The two stereo tracks are nearly identical.
It's always possible to hear words as similar-sounding words, but
basically, the lyrics jibe with the published version.


"Revolution 9"
The Beatles, untitled, a.k.a. THE WHITE ALBUM

Rumor: Various reversed and/or one-track speech. The reversal of
"Number nine" to "Turn me on, dead man" has pretty much been
discounted as coincidence (though it appears on Congressman
Dornan's list).
Findings: Distinction between lyrics and any hidden message blurs
on "Revolution 9." The eight-minute cut is a montage of sounds
collected by John Lennon and Yoko Ono. It includes discordant
music, radio broadcasts, sirens, applause, gunfights, sports
cheers, the crackling of a fire, screams, a baby gurgling, a choir
singing, and much that cannot be identified. For this
investigation, "Revolution 9" was transcribed four times, twice on
each stereo channel. One copy of each of the tracks was reversed.
The four resulting versions were compared with each other and
against the original two-channel version.
     "Revolution 9" contains a lot of talking. Played in stereo,
forward, the longest stretch of understandable speech is probably
an announcer saying, "...every one of them knew that as time went
by they'd get a little bit older and a little bit slower..."
     One believable instance of reversed speech occurs: someone
saying "Let me out! Let me out!" (once held to represent McCartney
in his totaled Aston-Martin). Two iffy reversals occur on the
backward recording of the right stereo track:"She used to be
assistant" and "There were two men..." Neither is clear enough or
long enough to be convincing. Some of the music, including the
recurring theme, sounds more natural in reverse.
     "Turn me on, dead man" is a typical phonetic reversal. The
forward "number nine" (repeated throughout the cut) is clear; the
reversal is slurred -- something like "turn me on dedmun." It has
been claimed that "number nine" must be pronounced with a British
accent or with some careful inflection in order to reverse to
"Turn me on, dead man." This seems not to be so. As an experiment,
three American-accent renderings of "number nine" were reversed.
All sound about as much like "Turn me on, dead man" as the record
did. Like the other phonetic reversals, "Turn me on, dead man"
must be considered a coincidence.
     Much of "Revolution 9" is on one stereo track only. Near the
end a voice says "A fine natural imbalance...the Watusi...the
twist...Eldorado...Eldorado." "A fine natural imbalance" is on the
right track only, though the words that follow are in stereo. One
of the longer bits of speech -- "Who could tell what he was
saying? His voice was low and his [unintelligible] was high and
his eyes were low" -- is clear on the left track, a bare whisper
on the right.
     There is a stereophonically concealed "secret message" on
"Revolution 9." The words are on the right track. They begin about
four minutes, fifty-eight seconds into the cut and run for about
twenty-two seconds. They are not likely to be noticed in stereo
because of the much louder left track. The sound of applause
begins on the left track at about five minutes, one second into
the cut. Deafening noises -- the clapping, sirens, music --
continue on the left track until five minutes, forty seconds. It
may or may not have been Lennon's and Ono's intention to conceal
the spoken passage. Given the haphazard quality of "Revolution 9,"
the concealment may have been accidental. To recover the passage,
the left track must be switched off. The right track can then be
heard to contain a sound like a stopwatch ticking, behind these
words:

     So the wife called, and we better go to see a
     surgeon....[A SCREAM MUFFLES A LINE THAT SOUNDS LIKE
     Well, what with the prices, the prices have snowballed,
     no wonder it's closed.] ...So any and all, we went to
     see the dentist instead, who gave him a pair of teeth,
     which wasn't any good at all. So instead of that he
     joined the bloody navy and went to sea.
                      by William Poundstone
                              1986

     There really are backward messages on rock albums. And the
controversy over "backward masking" and "porn rock" has inspired a
whole new spate of messages. There may have been more genuine
backward messages in the past few years than ever before.
     The backward message controversy is usually traced to the
1960s and John Lennon's avant-garde sound mixing on such tracks as
"Revolution 9" on the Beatles' WHITE ALBUM. Lennon probably wasn't
trying to conceal a message so much as create an interesting
sound.
     The matter might have ended right there had it not been for
the Paul McCartney death rumor. College kids tried playing Beatles
records forward, backward, and at various speeds to find "clues"
to McCartney's fate. In the process they found snippets of speech
from Lennon's experiments. Even after McCartney was found safe and
sound in Scotland, some listeners continued to look for hidden
messages.
     Somehow, fundamentalist Christian groups became convinced
(ca. 1982) that the alleged messages were commercials for devil
worship. Not a single indisputable satanic message has turned up,
but there were scattered attempts to ban or label certain albums.
In 1986 one fundamentalist group announced that the theme song for
the old MR. ED TV show contains the word "Satan" when played
backward.)
     Ironically, the publicity accorded nonexistent messages has
inspired several artists -- among them porn rock hearing witness
Frank Zappa -- to hide real background messages in their music.
It's easy to do.
     The performer speaks or sings the message normally, then
reverses the tape, which is mixed into the soundtrack. This is all
accomplished simply enough at any recording studio.
     What's not so simple is playing it back. More home record,
cassette, and compact disk players won't play backward. You can
turn a record backward with a pencil eraser, but it's not good for
the needle or the turntable. The only way to reproduce the message
with full fidelity is to use a professional-quality reel-to-reel
tape player and splice the tape in backward.
     We used the facilities of KLOS radio in Los Angeles to
reverse some recent records containing true backward messages.


"Secret Messages"
Electric Light Orchestra, SECRET MESSAGES

ELO's ELDORADO album was among those alleged to contain satanic
backward masked messages. A patient listening to ELDORADO played
backward reveals no such messages. You hear only what you ought to
hear -- the reversed lyrics of the songs, which sound nothing like
the "messages" claimed to be there. In the wake of such
allegations, ELO did put an (innocuous) backward message on their
FACE THE MUSIC album. Perhaps they thought this would show how
silly the allegations were. Instead, the backward-masking people
seized on this as proof that the other "messages" were real. In
the latest volley, ELO has named an album after the controversy.
     In Britain (where the backward-masking issue is viewed as an
American eccentricity), the cover of SECRET MESSAGES has a mock
warning label to youth about the hidden label. Word of the albums'
impending release in the United States caused enough of a furor to
chill CBS Records into deleting the cover blurb.
     The reversed message is easy to find. It's at the beginning
of the first song, which is itself called "Secret Messages." You
can hear reversed speech when you play the record normally. A
voice intones "secret messages" -- forward -- in the middle of the
reversed speech, lest anyone dare be so unhip as to not know
what's going on.
     We transferred a new copy of SECRET MESSAGES to reel-to-reel
tapes and played it backward. The backward message goes: "WELCOME
TO THE BIG SHOW/ WELCOME TO THE BIG SHOW."
     That's it.


"Ya Hozna"
Frank Zappa, THEM OR US

"Ya Hozna," a six-minute composition on the first record of the
THEM OR US double album, is ENTIRELY backward. The albums' inner
cover, which includes lyrics for the other songs, says, "backwards
vocal -- you figure it out" of this cut. It credits Frank and Moon
Zappa, George Duke, and Napoleon Murphy Brock as vocalists.
     Played forward, "Ya Howza" sounds like a record played
backward -- reasonably so. The vocals are prominent and
unintelligible. Moon Zappa's voice is curiously recognizable, even
in reverse. It is hard to tell whether the music was recorded
forward or backward.
     When "Ya Howza" is played in reverse, you discover that the
music is virtually a palindrome -- it sounds about the same
forward and backward. The voices are all backward. In some cases
they have been modified electronically. Many of the words are
muffled. Even after repeated careful listening on both stereo
tracks, it is difficult to make out many of the lyrics. It doesn't
help that some of the words seem to be stream-of-consciousness
nonsense. Some of the unintelligible stuff sounds like opera.
     Starting at the beginning of the reversed tape -- the end of
the forward tape -- the clearer vocals go like this: "I am the
heaven, I am the water." This is in a hymnlike register. "You are
a lonely little girl./ But your mommy and your daddy hold you." A
singsong synthesizer voice.
     The most interesting part of the lyrics is an intermittently
orgasmic rap in Moon Zappa's Valley Girl voice. There are three
short monologues:

I'm like green!
I'm like squat!
I'm like soul!
Repeat, like soul!
I'm like pull, push,
Okay, like slow, slow.

You're never too old
Like slow, like slow, like slow
Okay, I like it.


All right, faster, faster,
Go, do it, do it twice,
Yeah, that feels good,
I'm looking great,
Yeah, fer shure!
Like, no way!


"No Anchovies, Please"
J. Geils Band, LOVE STINKS

"No Anchovies, Please" is a novelty song, really a narration with
sound effects, about a woman who is kidnapped after eating
anchovies. She is taken to a "foreign-speaking" country. The sound
effect of the foreign tongue seems reversed. When you do play it
in reverse, it becomes: "It doesn't take a genius to know the
difference between chicken shit and chicken salad."


"Darling Nikki"
Prince, PURPLE RAIN

"Darling Nikki," cited as porn rock before Congress, is about a
dominatrix in a hotel lobby masturbating with a magazine. In part,
the complaint was that the album cover (flowers, and Prince on a
motorcycle) wasn't explicit enough to warn kids of the suggestive
lyrics. Senator Paula Hawkins apparently was not aware of a
backward message hidden in "Darling Nikki." The last thirty-five
seconds of the song is gibberish. The music changes abruptly and
becomes a repeated glottal sound. Then a two-syllable sound is
repeated twice, something like "heaven, heaven." Unintelligible
speech follows. At the end is a sound reminiscent of rain or bacon
frying , and wind sounds.
     Played backward, the message becomes:

     Hello, how are you?
     I'm fine 'cause I know that the Lord is coming soon.
     Coming, coming soon.

     It is clearly Prince and the Revolution singing this. The
words are clear but the intonation is funny -- the linger on some
words. Perhaps this is to make the reversed message you hear
playing the record normally a little less conspicuous.
     This is a weird reversal of the supposed secret message
menace. Raunchy forward lyrics conceal a religious secret message.


"Judas Kiss"
Petra, MORE POWER TO YOU

Petra is an obscure group that sings religious songs to a rock
beat. As further proof that things have gone full circle, the
backward-masking controversy prompted Petra to include a wholesome
backward message on their MORE POWER TO YOU album. It is in the
transition between two songs, just before "Judas Kiss." Clearly
audible gibberish reverses to this (the husky voice a cross
between George Beverly Shea and Dee Snider): "What are you looking
for the Devil for, when you ought to be looking for the Lord?"

AFL JoyceM Welcome to the Apple II Music & Sound chat - our discussion will
           be on NoiseTracker - the new FTA music program for the GS.  AFA
           Gene will be our host this evening...Gene, the floor is yours :)

AFA Gene   Hi all... well first I'd like to point out, if y'all aren't aware
           yet, that a spanking new version of NoiseTracker has recently
           been released (9 days ago) and is now available in our New Files
           library. It is version 0.5. I haven't played around with it much
           yet, but it's supposed to fix a lot of the little bugs in 0.3
           (the first version we had online).  NoiseTracker also includes
           the ability to directly import "modules," a term used for a
           certain type of Amiga song file which has become popular among PC
           users using the SoundBlaster sound card.

           Now, via NT, these "MOD" files are accessible by the GS. We
           expect to see a lot of activity on this end as far as ports from
           the PC and Amiga go. Note that you should be able to go straight
           to the PC music forum and download any recently uploaded MOD
           songfiles (there was a bug in the first wide release of the PCAO
           software, however, so a bunch of files with dates between around
           March 1991 and September 1991 may not download properly. Note that
           to use these PC MOD files, you'll have to rename the downloaded
           file "MOD.xxxxxx" if you want it to show up automatically in NT's
           "open" dialog box. (On the PC, all MOD files are named
           "xxxxxxxx.MOD" instead.)   Also, if the files are packed with ZIP
           compression, you'll need a program from the Communications Forum
           called AGATE -- it's a terminal program that includes the ability
           to unpack ZIP files.

           Now, I guess the best thing to do would be to talk about our
           favorite songfiles... there have been a few complaints, in fact,
           that people were not being "descriptive" enough in their file
           descriptions for uploads in describing the songs.

AFC Eddie  ?

AFA Gene   GA ed

AFC Eddie  Once a MOD file is unpacked with Agate, is a file type change
           needed?

AFA Gene   Nope, since all that NT looks for is the "MOD." being the first
           four characters in the filename.

AFC Eddie  OK, Thanks!

Deanna7332 Question...

JonL7      Can you list some of the features of Noisetracker?

AFA Gene   (you don't even need that "MOD." if you want to type the name in
           directly.)

Deanna7332 Did any of these mod files have anything to do with FTA's "Module
           A"

AFA Gene   Sure Jon, right after we answer Deanna's question. Deanna, you
           mean "Modulae?"

Deanna7332 Yes, that's it.

AFA Gene   Modulae was a demo written by FTA last year. (i'll get to you in a
           sec Doors).  It used SoundSmith v0.95 for all it's music. There
           is no connection between MOD files and Modulae by FTA.

Deanna7332 Throughout the demo it said "Loading modules"

AFA Gene   Those "modules" are not the same as Amiga soundfile "modules" --
           you see, what Modulae really was was a "stringing together" of a
           bunch of neat little tiny demos that FTA had written. So they
           called each little demo a "module" and thus the entire demo as a
           whole, "Modulae" (fancy plural of module?)

Deanna7332 Ok I understand.  Thank you. :)

AFL JoyceM Latin, Gene :)

AFA Gene   The term "MODule" from the Amiga comes from the idea that all the
           stuff needed to play the songfile (all the instruments + the
           sequence file) are included into one file, the "module."

TheDoors1  Gene, I have tried to d/l some recent uploaded MODs in the PC
           music area and still the problem exists.

AFA Gene   As I understand it, the problem was fixed VERY recently (correct
           me on this Joyce) and files uploaded as recently as early
           November still might not work depending on the version of the
           PCAO software that the uploader used.

AFL JoyceM Actually, Gene...I was under the impression that it had been, but
           if Doors is still having a problem, then it must not be fixed.

AFA Gene   What date was the file you tried to d/l, Door?

TheDoors1  umm 11/17, around there

AFA Gene   hmmm.... well i can tell you one thing... if it didn't work, don't
           waste your time again later... the problem is in the Apple
           software's method of d/lling files, and there are no plans to
           upgrade the Apple AO software.

AFL JoyceM I will endeavor to get an answer to that PC downloading
           problem/question :)

ThomasK63  i have a quick question... what can you use to unpack amiga mod
           files? On the PC side, that is.

TheDoors1  Agate Thomas

ELECTMUSIC Doors... what happens on after downloading..

Deanna7332 If it's LZHed you can't unless you have an IBM or
           PC/Transporter.

AFA Gene   If GS-ShrinkIt doesn't have that ability, i don't think there
           exists any such utility on the GS.

TheDoors1  What do you mean Elect?

ELECTMUSIC After you download the file... where do you encounter a problem?

TheDoors1  ok, you know when you download the file and at some point in the
           download the file starts to appear on your screen.  That's when I
           cancel it.

ThomasK63  I am sure soething good can be made w/out resorting to Amiga
           files

AFC Eddie  Yes, Doors, I believe the problem is with the PC software it was
           UL'd with.

TheDoors1  yeah Eddie.

GNO Tim    Amiga MOD files are typically compressed using LHarc.  I've
           uncompressed several on my Unix machine at school.

ThomasK63  good time for someone to make a lharc unpacker...

AFC DYAJim someone might be ;)

GNO Tim    Several people are already

AFC Eddie  Can't wait, Jim!

AFA Gene   Jon, did you have a question?

JonL7      The features of Noisetracker :)

AFA Gene   Oh yes... okay, here goes, in a nutshell, from most important to
           least:


AFA Gene   *  ability to import MOD files

           *  ability to import Soundsmith files

           *  ProDOS 8 based

           *  virtually no editing abilities (not a feature but important to
           know)

AFC DYAJim :)

AFA Gene   *  forgot: and the most important feature of all, the ability to
           hold instrument files in regular system RAM instead of DOC RAM,
           allowing for instruments far beyond the regular 64K limit found
           in ALL other GS music programs.

ThomasK63  I'll buy that!

TheDoors1  I have another question...when you're ready.

AFA Gene   GA Doors

TheDoors1  ok..is it true that NoiseTracker will take in soundsmith files and
           play them more clearly

AFA Gene   Well, as far as "what you hear," yes there is a definite
           difference with some instruments. It does NOT play the sounds
           more "clearly," but it just plays them in a different way. What
           many people seem to like about this "different way" is that
           sustained instruments (i.e. instruments designed to be played
           in a loop to simulate a long held note) seem to work better (or
           perhaps simply the way they were originally intended to work).

TheDoors1  I see

Deanna7332 Which takes up more space - MOD or NT  w/soundfile ?

AFA Gene   Deanna, it depends a few things, such as how big the sequence is,
           how many instruments you have, etc. Once you have a lot of
           assorted files, it'll probably average out to be about the same
           give or take a hundred blocks on your HD. So it basically depends
           on whether you prefer to have your instruments separate or not.

Deanna7332 Does playing quality differ with either one ?

AFA Gene   Nope. It's exactly the same either way. Loading time is the same
           too.

AFC Eddie  Can NT save songs as MOD files?

AFA Gene   Nope. It has options for Open and Close module, but these are
           still inactive.

AFA Gene   If there are no more questions, I'd like to talk about which NT
           files out there are the "hottest," since this info could be
           useful to many users who are interested in downloading NT/MOD
           files.

           My personal favorite is "Lambada," which is supplied by FTA with
           the program but is available separately on America
           Online.Everything about this file is really impressive except
           perhaps the sound quality of the horn-ish melody instrument.

           What about y'all, what are your favorite NT files?

AFL JoyceM Gene, there is a classical song for NT, but can't remember the
           name, but it is good.

AFC Eddie  I like Dragnet!

ELECTMUSIC So do I Ed

TheDoors1  I like Seven something

Deanna7332 My most favorite of all mod files is Pleasure Principle

AFC Eddie  <--appreciate's Greg's taste!

AFL JoyceM :)

AFA Gene   Deanna, i assume you got that from a local board?

Deanna7332 I got it from the PC forum here.

TheDoors1  I saw it there also

Deanna7332 I think under "Pleasure"

AFA Gene   Would you be able to upload it here? If it's really that good, we
           ought to have it available directly in our oun NT lib here (BTW
           folks, we will be releasing a new NoiseTracker software library
           soon!)

AFC Eddie  What a Forum!!!

Deanna7332 That sounds great!

AFL JoyceM Gene, do you think it will be possible for synthLAB files to be
           converted to MOD files?

AFL JoyceM MOD files?

AFA Gene   I doubt it, Joyce. The formats are so diametrically opposed in
           their entire basis of their file formats that it wouldn't be
           worth the time for a programmer to develop such a convertor.

Deanna7332 Isn't it possible to move the mod file from the PC forum to our
           music library?

AFA Gene   But..... it might be worth the time for a MIDI File Format to MOD
           convertor, since these two formats are more widely accepted.

Nuzz       they have nothing better to do Gene

ELECTMUSIC Gene.. some interesting similarities with DTune and NTracker

AFA Gene   They lose the file, tho, Deanna. :)

AFL JoyceM In what way, Greg?

ELECTMUSIC Both Prodos 8

Deanna7332 Shhh they won't know a thing :)

ELECTMUSIC I also believe Bill uses a shuttling of sound data between Doc
           Ram and Ram.

AFC Eddie  Interesting, Greg.

ELECTMUSIC Thats how he gets some of the excellent instrument quality

AFC Eddie  But Diversitune has that one distinction:  MIDI input.

AFL JoyceM Deanna, we would greatly appreciate it if you would upload that
           'Pleasure' song to our library :)

ELECTMUSIC Agreed Ed.. one of the factors FTA doesn't like to incorporate
           into their programs.

Deanna7332 I'll u/l it tonight if possible.

AFL JoyceM Thanks :)

AFC Eddie  Thanks, Deanna!

AFL JoyceM I will send Bill B a copy of NoiseTracker + some MOD files...to
           see what comments we get from him (will send when I get back).

AFC DYAJim What ever happened to that diversitune upgrade that was talked
           about ?

ELECTMUSIC That would be interesting Joyce

AFC Eddie  Bill apparently still working on it, Jim.

ELECTMUSIC I am sure he would appreciate the Prodos 8

AFC DYAJim good..

AFL JoyceM Jim...RSN....he was hoping by Christmas (this year), but he is
           soooo busy with his job, who knows?

AFC DYAJim Oh yeah, I noticed the speed calcuation in NT .5 is inaccurate
           :)

AFC DYAJim I recall he has set a lot of Christmas projected dates :)

ELECTMUSIC He was one of the first "Free Tools" experts in breaking all the
           rules for economic sake.

AFC DYAJim like for the vaporware DT inst editor like 2 years ago.

Deanna7332 Are there any Christmas Mod or NT songs?

AFC Eddie  Oh yeah, Diversi-Editor!

AFL JoyceM I know, Jim - but that I know he has been working on.

AFC DYAJim he projected Christmas for it, and it never came :)

AFA Gene   Not yet in AMS, but hopefully the Holiday Contest will change all
           that. :)

AFC DYAJim I look foreward to any upgrades..

AFL JoyceM Not that I am aware of Deanna - you have some?  hint, hint

Deanna7332 Nope sorry.  I was hoping there were some that could be u/led
           here

AFC DYAJim I'll be breaking out the xmas tune book rsn.. I should be able to
           midi a few :) (which rules out nt)

AFL JoyceM Question...

AFC Eddie  It would be more appropriate to have a converter from Appleworks
           spreadsheet to MOD than from MIDI!

AFL JoyceM If I got ahold of an Amiga song (MOD) disk...how would I convert
           them for here?

AFA Gene   You mean an Amiga-formatted disk?

AFL JoyceM Yes

AFC DYAJim Ack.. methinks you need an amiga and a null modem cable or a
           modem.

AFA Gene   Methinks Jim is right

AFC DYAJim LOL!!  Design your music in the spreadsheet then import to NT :)
           IT might actually have better editing?!! :)

AFC Eddie  Right!

AFL JoyceM Me thinks he is right.  If I had them upload to me, would that
           work?

AFA Gene   Yep; should work like a charm.

AFC DYAJim Yah.. as long as they're coming from an amiga

AFL JoyceM Great....I will work on that when I get back  (making note now).

AFL JoyceM Gene, will you get some of those files (NT) sent to that area
           tonight?  If so, I will leave the needed message :)

AFA Gene   That's all I have planned for tonight's chat, Joyce. Yep, I'll
           move some files right now.

AFL JoyceM Thanks...

AFL JoyceM Then we should have our NoiseTracker Library by end of the week in
           AMS :)

ELECTMUSIC Gene... quick question:  Are you launching NTracker from a 3.5
           disk?

AFL JoyceM Okay, guys...I will see you all the week of December 11th (may the
           4th) as I am off on vacation.

AFA Gene   Yep greg

AFC JohnC  Where are you going?

ELECTMUSIC Do you encounter out of memory problems

AFL JoyceM Night all...and Gene, thanks for an excellent chat and great
           explanations of NoiseTracker.

Nuzz       Joyce, I have good news for FutureSound owners. SoundConvert will
           support it in the first release

AFC Eddie  Great, Mike!

AFA Gene   Greg, i always keep my RAMdisk at 0 when using noisetracker. Not
           only are

AFC JohnC  Mike...SoundConvert...released?

AFL JoyceM Great, Mike.  When can we get SoundConvert, Mike? and FutureSound
           :)

AFA Gene   there a couple of bugs with memory management, but if you're
           loading in a MOD file that's really big, NT will eat your RAMdisk.

AFC Eddie  Sounds good.

Nuzz       The manual is being "layout". Release date should be about 1st
           week of Dec

ELECTMUSIC Tnxs Gene

AFC JohnC  YES.......WTG Nuzz!!!!!!!!

Deanna7332 Yes, why is there on some MOD files a stop somewhere in the middle
           ?

Deanna7332 That's really frustrating!

AFL JoyceM Mike, leave me E-Mail on when and how I can send your the $$ to
           get it.

AFL JoyceM Again...night all

Nuzz       gee John, I had to do something to explain the delay :)

ELECTMUSIC Thanks Gene for a GREAT chat!

AFC Eddie  Yes, Gene!  Great!

AFA Gene   Thanks Greg, 'night!

AFA Gene   thanx, see y'all later :)

Copyright 1987 Bob Szekely.

    John Michael Osbourne, (known as "Ozzy" to his fans), has in his long 
career as vocalist for Black Sabbath had his work with the group misconstrued 
as advocating Satanism.  In a 1983 radio special featuring Ozzy, the 
interviewer expressed precisely this point; "...Ozzy has always been shrouded 
in the darkest of Satanic imagery.  Yet if you really listen to his music, 
you'll find that what he is saying differs greatly from his image...."(1)  Even 
the group's image has often been described as "occult and diabolic".(2)

    The important point to remember here is to differentiate between appearance 
and reality.  Although the name "Black Sabbath" conjures up images of witches 
and sorcerers paying homage to Satan for the powers bestowed upon them, this 
does not make it safe to assume that the group that went by this name 
necessarily drew the inspiration from the occult.(3)  The closest they ever 
came to it was a gothic horror film featuring Boris Karloff as narrator; they 
adopted their name directly from the name of this film.(4)  Black Sabbath was 
involved in the black arts as much as Karloff practiced casting spells off-
screen.  Tony Iommi, the group's guitarist, summed it up best when he described 
the group as having basically "...the same appeal as a horror movie.  It's all 
an act."(5)










    Just as their film counterpart did, Ozzy and Sabbath found the occult 
mythos to be an effective vehicle for powerful social commentary; particularly 
when put in the context of heavy-metal rock and roll.  Ozzy himself noted that 
there are "...people who pick up my [album] cover[s] and go...'This guy's got 
to be singing about Devil, doom, death and destruction.'  Which is not the 
case...."(6)

    The late Lester Bangs likened the group to Bob Dylan and William Burroughs, 
describing them all as "...moralists...trying to deal with a serious present 
situation in an honest way...."(7)  Ozzy and Black Sabbath merely bring to 
light the many evils of our world in their work, to try and make us realize 
that we are all victim to their influence.  They hope to make us recognize 
these evils so that we may take up arms against them; a point Ozzy emphatically 
stresses:  "...one thing everybody has got to understand about Black Sabbath's 
lyrics.  They're not downer lyrics, they're just telling everybody where it's 
at..."(8)  He also cites the group's most controversial tune, "Black Sabbath", 
as a response to the ignorant hippie culture still force when the tune was 
written in 1970:  "The hippies said: 'The world is beautiful man.' (sic)  You 
only had to look around you to see how crappy it was.  It was ridiculous 
listening to that stuff, let alone playing it, so we just wrote about the world 
the way it really was and how it affected us - and we felt better in ourselves 
because we were really being honest...."(9)

        38  ONE.
        39  THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN SAVE YOU KNOW FROM
        40  ALL THIS SIN AND HATE.
        41  OR WILL YOU STILL JEER AT ALL YOU HEAR?
        42  YES!-I THINK IT'S TOO LATE.

    In this piece, the group asserts a belief in an afterlife and spiritual 
redemption.  As grisly as the image of a hanged pontiff is, its shock value is 
a necessary part of the message:  They reject religious dogma, stating that a 
belief in God, in one's own heart, is the only guiding light to help one inn 
his life (lines 11/12, 39/40).  Furthermore, the reject religious hypocrisy 
(lines 5/6, 7/8) and peer pressure (verses III, IV) as excuses for not 
accepting God.  To clarify further:  following the crowd does not justify 
shrugging responsibility for one's own actions.

    After re-reading, it becomes obvious that this song is an ascerbic critique 
of atheism; (line 35/36) I refer here again to verses three and four.  In these 
two verses, the picture painted in one of Godless conformity and how it's 
viewed as being as foolish as Paganism.  These lyrics set an example for the 
listener by relating personal experience (lines 13-16).  However, for those who 
cannot accept this the group has no recourse but to condemn them, although 
rather ironically; they hope that their rhetorical loss of faith in the 
listener will open his eyes (line 42).

            WHAT IS THIS, THAT STANDS BEFORE ME?
            FIGURE IN BLACK, WHICH POINTS AT ME
            TURN ROUND QUICK AND START TO RUN
            FIND OUT I'M THE CHOSEN ONE.  OH, NO!
            
            BIG BLACK SHAPE WITH EYES OF FIRE
            TELLING PEOPLE THEIR DESIRE
            SATAN'S SITTING THERE, HE'S SMILING
            WATCHES THOSE FLAMES GET HIGHER AND HIGHER
            OH, NO, NO, -- PLEASE GOD HELP ME!
            
                IS THIS THE END MY FRIEND?
                SATAN'S COMING 'ROUND THE BEND
                PEOPLE RUNNING 'CAUSE THEY'RE SCARED
                THE PEOPLE BETTER GO AND BEWARE
                NO, NO!  PLEASE--NO!!
                
                
    The all time controversy winner!  Is this not irrefutably  THE song about 
Black Magic in rock?  It's all so obvious, suffuse with evil imagery; Satan, 
walls of flame, figure in black, and damnation at the end.  Yes, I see the 
images too; it definitely concerns Black Magic.  Then again, Shakespeare's 
Macbeth employed scenes of witches involved in conjurations; does that mean 
that Shakespeare was a warlock?  Poe used to write sardonic tragedies about 
twisted murderers and the bizarre nature of acts, did that make him an evil, 
leering, demented killer?  Did either of them advocated what they wrote about?  
One has to remember that writing about something is not necessarily the same as 
emulating it.  Tony Iommi spoke out quite strongly about this:  "People are 
bringing us down saying that we are a Black Magic group.  I think they must be










getting mixed up with Black Widow.  We don't do any sacrifices on stage, and 
we're not on a black magic kick.  We wanted to do heavy numbers and the guitar 
riffs we worked out were more suited to evil things than love.  We play songs 
about black magic, but they are more likely to be against than for it."(12)  

    By now, you're probably asking yourself who Black Widow is, right?  Then 
it's time for a little history:

        Sabbath, before they were known as Sabbath, had the same line-up but 
two earlier names.  The first one was Polka Tulk, which seemed sure to doom 
them to obscurity.(13)  The soon realized this and changed the group's name to 
Earth.  Now, Earth was a blues band at the end of the English blues boom.  As 
if that wasn't bad enough, they soon discovered that not only was there another 
group named Earth, but they had also released a single.  To avoid confusion, 
they changed their name again.(14)  But what made them decide on that name?  
Just ask Ozzy:  "I just liked the name Black Sabbath because of the succession 
of vowel sounds.(15)  If that sounds ludicrous just consider this:  Sabbath was 
"...the first of the really committed, loud and heavy bands..."(16)  They 
needed a name to match the gut-wrenching power they were developing.  Tony knew 
that he wanted Sabbath to be noticed above all the rest of the British blues 
bands:  "We wanted something of our own that we'd like and people would like.  
And we wanted something loud!"










    Tony didn't hate the blues.  He'd cut his teeth as a guitarist on the likes 
of The Shadows, Buddy Holly and Django Rheinhardt, developing his own style 
from there.  But he realized the group had no future in the blues:

        'We couldn't keep playing 12-bars forever.  We just got fed up with 
Earth music.  It was jazz, blues stuff.  It was good for practice but nothing 
else.'

    In the late 'Sixties, blues groups were a dime a dozen in Birmingham and 
interest was waning in the blues boom due to the glut of groups.  One man, by 
the name of Jim Simpson, had heard Earth around the Birmingham club circuit and 
understood what they were trying to do.  He decided to take them under his 
wing.  With the aid of his massive record collection, Jim expanded the group's 
horizons in the areas of jazz and blues.  He introduced them to artists like 
Wes Montgomery, Count Basie and Jimmy Rushing.  It was from Rushing in 
particular that they derived the repetitive riff style so readily noticeable in 
their later incarnation as Black Sabbath.

    The Count Basie influence is evidenced in the song "Wicked World" from the 
first album; Sabbath drummer Bill Ward uses a "'sighing hi-hat'...in the manner 
of Basie's drummer Jo Jones."










    The influence is subtle, almost subliminal.  Yet it is one which was not 
thought capable of hard, 'heavy' rock bands in the late 'Sixties.  Although Led 
Zeppelin and Jimi Hendrix also had their work steeped in blues and jazz 
derivations (Hendrix' "Third Stone From the Sun" and Zeppelin's version of 
Willie Dixon's "I Can't Quit You Baby" from their first album), neither was 
able to match the intense energy of Black Sabbath.  Iommi has always had a 
preference for music with an original, distinct style of its' own; as an 
example, he mentions guitarists Joe Pass and Alvin Lee as two of his strongest 
songwriting influences.

    It would also be necessary that Sabbath develop a unique, distinctive style 
and image of their own.  Though they had changed their name from Earth to Black 
Sabbath to avoid confusion with the other Earth; at the same time another group 
emerged by the name of Black Widow "...who WERE profoundly influenced by the 
occult, had a male witch as a patron, and wrote pieces like "Come to The 
Sabbat."  Unfortunately, Sabbath was constantly reaping the benefits of Widow's 
publicity.

    Sabbath was a group that never minced words.  If they saw something as 
destructive, they would be sure to rub the listener's face it it.  They did not 
want their point to be missed.

    With their straightforward, sometimes brutal way of looking at things, they 
try to shock the listener's conscience back into awareness.  The imagery of 
"Hand of Doom", from the Paranoid album, is candid and condemning; it is a 
strong statement against drug addiction and rightly so...

            PRICE OF LIFE YOU CRY
            NOW YOU'RE GONNA DIE
            
            
    Many people felt the group's overall direction was pessimistic and had a 
negative effect on its listener's due to that.  "Ozzy insisted that if people 
thought he was having a bad effect on the minds of young kids, they should go 
and watch the TV news where real murder and mayhem were a way of life, and 
shown night after night." (18)

    Sabbath was never negative in their message; they were simply truthful 
about waht they saw as wrong in the world.  If you "Strip away the horror 
stories, the imagery and the hysteria, (and) turn down the amps a notch...you 
have a well-rehearsed, solid blues and rock band, powered by a dedication to 
well defined objectives."  On the top of the list of those objectives was 
truth; Sabbath never feared facing that truth squarely, regardless of what many 
people thought of them.

Long, long, time ago,
I can still remember,
When the local calls were "free".
And I knew if I paid my bill,
And never wished them any ill,
That the phone company would let me be...

But Uncle Sam said he knew better,
Split 'em up, for all and ever!
We'll foster competition:
It's good capital-ism!

I can't remember if I cried,
When my phone bill first tripled in size.
But something touched me deep inside,
The day... Bell System... died.

And we were singing...

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
"Our local calls have us in hock!" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

Is your office Step by Step,
Or have you gotten some Crossbar yet?
Everybody used to ask...
Oh, is TSPS coming soon?
IDDD will be a boon!
And, I hope to get a Touch-Tone phone, real soon...

The color phones are really neat,
And direct dialing can't be beat!
My area code is "low":
The prestige way to go!

Oh, they just raised phone booths to a dime!
Well, I suppose it's about time.
I remember how the payphones chimed,
The day... Bell System... died.

And we were singing...

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
"Our local calls have us in hock!" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

Back then we were all at one rate,
Phone installs didn't cause debate,
About who'd put which wire where...
Installers came right out to you,
No "phone stores" with their ballyhoo,
And 411 was free, seemed very fair!

But FCC wanted it seems,
To let others skim long-distance creams,
No matter 'bout the locals,
They're mostly all just yokels!

And so one day it came to pass,
That the great Bell System did collapse,
In rubble now, we all do mass,
The day... Bell System... died.

So bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
"Our local calls have us in hock!" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

I drove on out to Murray Hill,
To see Bell Labs, some time to kill,
But the sign there said the Labs were gone.
I went back to my old CO,
Where I'd had my phone lines, years ago,
But it was empty, dark, and ever so forlorn...

No relays pulsed,
No data crooned,
No MF tones did play their tunes,
There wasn't a word spoken,
All carrier paths were broken...

And so that's how it all occurred,
Microwave horns just nests for birds,
Everything became so absurd,
The day... Bell System... died.

So bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
"Our local calls have us in hock!" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

We were singing:

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
"Our local calls have us in hock!" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?

Come on down and visit my Church          Is he sacred? Just a smidgen!
Cause it's good enough for me!            But it's good enough for me!

Brother Jerry is a cretin             Brother Oral's in his tower,
But with all the cash he's gettin'    Trusting in the Lord's power
Lotsa folks'll be forgettin           Getting richer by the hour,
It's the "Land of the Free!"          Now he's got the ransom fee!

Brother Robert's church is Crystal     Brother Earnest is a healer
But all the Bible that he's missed'll  And not QUITE a wheeler-dealer --
Make you "hotter than a pistol"        More a jumper and a squealer
But he's good enough for me!           So he's good enough for me!

Brother Jim and Sister Tammy       Then there's good ol' Brother Billy
Had a show that was a whammy       Bringing souls in willy-nilly.
But now they are in Miami          All his trips are kinda silly,
Tryin' t'get back on TV!           But he's good enough for me!

Let us read works of Confucius         We will worship Xipe-Totec   
As we walk thru Massachusetts          Tho it is a little lo-tek *   
In white robes that freeze our tushes  It is not a bit ero-tek (erotic)   
But it's good enough for me!           But it's good enough for me!
   
                                            * "low-tech(nology)

We will worship Xochipilli         And the Romans said of Jesus 
Though it might be a bit silly     "Lets kill him, he don't please us" 
Running naked makes me chilly      "But the Atheists will tease us" 
But it's good enough for me!       And thats good enough for me 

You could join Jehovah's Witness             
Running door to door for fitness
Well if you've been blessed with quickness,
Then thats good enough for me

We used to study old Confucius      And let's not forget Pelagius
As we sat there on our tushes       Though some call him outrageous
We're learning but don't push us    He is pious and courageous
And thats good enough for me        And he's good enough for me!

It's the opera written for us
We will all join in the chorus
It's the opera about Boris
Which is Godunov for me!

   We now wear daggers into Court!                        (16)

   Vissevald and his Lady Mara
   Danced "La Volta" through the night;
   He drank too deep of Imperium Compound,
   And she's now a satellite!                             (16)

   Gavin Kilkenny asked "Is there any-
   One who would dispute my rightful Throne?
   I'll take a double Imperium Compound,
   For it seems I have a clone!"                          (16)

   AElfwine the Saxon, whose family's flaxen
   Whose courtesy is all the Northland's pride;
   Mixes his mead now with Imperium Compound
   Often a bridesmaid, now a bride!                       (16)

   Siegfried, thrice King, showed us a new thing
   When fighting for the Eastern Crown:
   He took a swig of Imperium Compound
   And proved you CAN win from one-down!                  (16)

   Richard of Mont Roy-al, the Short he
   Is very fast and very hard to kill;
   As tall as Frodo, or his dog, Odo,
   But he kisses Froggies with a will!                     (5)

   Duke Sir Deaton, was never beaten
   On the field, or in the drinking hall;
   At the Catbox War with Caid,
   Left thirty bodies piled against the wall!              (5)

   Denis O'Titans was good at smitin'
   A Locksley Monster in every single way!
   Drank a little Imperium Compound
   And ATE Deaton's sword that day  // No! REALLY! //       (5)

   Wotan the Mongoloid, a little bit paranoid,
   But a nice guy none the less;
   Drank a mess of Imperium Compound
   Now he's Justin du Roc, I confess!                       (5)

   Then there's Duke Reynard, with a face like a St. Bernard
   Of the Dukes, he is the homliest
   He tends to toke up on Imperium Compound
   And go out and whomp on anybody's best!                   

   Oh, Ebenezer, thought he was Julius Caesar
   So they put him in the Funny Home.
   Then they gave him Imperium Compound,
   Now he's Emperor of Rome.
                 
   AltChorus: Oh let's drink a drink, a drink, a drink,  
              To Lily the Pink, the Pink, the Pink,
              The savior of the human ra-aa-ace.
              She invented Imperium Compound,
              Most effacatious in evr'y case.

   There was Horic, We thought he was sick,
   As a War-Puppy he was insane,
   Gave up Tranya for Imperium Compound,
   Now we have an Acid Reign!            //Oh wow, man!//   (18)

   This song'll bedevil the folks at a revel,
   And most of the time it will annoy the King,
   So take a drink of Imperium Compound
   And let's go Royalty-bedeviling!                         (5)

   Duchess Anna is quite a fan-a
   Going on a wartime shopping spree!  \\ War Point!\\

   And shopped so fast we couldn't see! \\ Z-o-o-o-om!\\    (5)

   Lyn of Whitewolfe, made of the right stuff,

   Duke Sir Brion, and Duke Sir Trelon,
   Won the Crown with regularity;

   Stephan von Geist, was most awful nice,
   And a chivalrous fighter without any doubt
   Took a swig of Imperium Compound
   And won the Crown his first time out!                    (5)

   All the Crusadenes were big, but not mean,
   And the finest fighters in the town.
   But they all drank Jerusalem Compound,
   Winning Crown after Crown after Crown!                   (5)

   Good Duke Arthur couldn't get no farth-er
   A Norman King in Aten Land

   Then King Richard, a bit of a bitch, heard
   A King's Crown could be done.
   Drank a little Imperium Compound

   There was Astra, no one ever asked her

   There's good old Igor, his prowess is meager

   Then there's Dagan, his brother's the Ka-Khan,
   Which is quite funny in a King!
   If he gets hooked on Imperium Compound
   There'll be new songs to sing!    \\ Oh, really?\\       (19)  

   Fredrick of Holland, who dwells in the Northland,
   A Master from the West, he came!
   Spends all his money for Imperium Compound
   That's why his garb's always the same!                   (20)

   Now Gyrth Oldcastle, round as a beer barrel,
   Once chose to quarrel with a certain Bard;
   The poet served him with Imperium Compound,
   And left him rendered down to lard!                      (20)

   Many tales abound of Imperium Compound
   And its' strange effects on Royalty,
   But after an hour, this song has no power,
   And by now, it's boring ME!                             (16)

   Duchess Malinda, who doesn't do windas

   And she sings and sings and sings and sings and sings!   (5)

   AltChorus: Oh it's too long, too long, too long
              To sing the whole song, the song, the song
              Longer than a Royal Court, it is!
              But sing it serial, this ditty Imperial
              And you'll be a bardic whiz!                 (5)

                                             IMPERIUM COMPOUND    
                                             (Atenveldt Verses)

   Now here's a story, a little bit gory,
   A little bit happy, a little bit sad.
   About a drink called Imperium Compound
   And how the SCA's been had!                       

   Chorus: Oh we think, we think, we think,
           The King is a fink, a fink, a fink,
           A figure of respectability
           Rules the Kingdom thru Imperium Compound
           The results are plain to see!

   Mongol Hordemen, those free-living swordsmen
   Subverting the Kingdoms from underneath!
   Have no use for Imperium Compound
   Except perhaps to brush their teeth!

   AltChorus: Oh we fink, we fink, we fink,
              The Khan and the Kink, the Kink, the Kink,
              And the Board, their Great Senilities!
              The Western Irgun, drinks Imperium Compound
              And we're BACK, with results you'll see!    

   Lady Laurel, with Authority Royal,
   Passes and rejects our heraldry
   She needs a swig of Imperium Compound
   Then perhaps she'd deign to talk to me!            

   Lady Trude thought it her duty
   To turn a social wrong into a Right
   Proved her point with Imperium Compound
   And showed that Cheshire Cats can fight!  //and scratch//

   The Board of Directors styled themselves The Electors
   And another con they tried to swing
   Now the BoD drinks Imperium Compound
   So we no longer need a King!                        

   AltChorus: Oh the Bod, the BoD, the BoD,
              It thinks it is God, is God, is God,
              The figure of Supreme Authority!
              And if we O.D.'d on Imperium Compund
              there'd be no need for Royalty!          

   Oh, MEDIEVAL Net, we thought it was all wet
   With witty remarks, and other kinds of sass
   We'll feed our computers on Imperium Compound
   And BYTE the BoD right on its' righteous ass!         

   Good old Duncan was often drunken
   Chasing all the ladies fair
   He bathed himself in Imperium Compound
   Now he has a little savoir faire!                     

                    (more)


  ATEN IMPERIUM (cont.)

   Ioseph of Locksley, never changes his socks, he
   Runs around looking like a Cavalier,
   He stocked up on Imperium Compound
   And he has enough to last for years and years!        

   AltChorus: Oh they forgot, forgot, forgot
              The Locks-e-ly Plot, the Plot, the Plot!
              And it works the best when it is underground!
              It isn't a hassle for a green-and-white tassle
              They're the ones that BREW Imperium Compound!  

   Trelon of the Wood, he was very good, he
   Was a leader that had never been beat before;
   But Caid had Imperium Compound,
   And Imperial Roman Caid won the War!  //with help!//   

   In Tyr Ysgithr, it's regularly whispered there
   That the Kingdom is ruled over by a King    // What's THAT? //
   They're "democratic" and quite erratic....
   They've forgot the purpose of the whole damn thing!     

   King Sir Mark von
, with his pretty white suit on,
   Rules the Kingdom both with Grace and Purity!
   He never touches Imperium Compound
   At least not where anyone else can see!               

   Duke Sir Deaton, was never beaten
   On the field, or in the drinking hall;
   At the Catbox War with Caid,
   Left thirty bodies piled against the wall!             

   Denis O'Titans was good at smitin'
   A Locksley Monster in every single way!
   Drank a little Imperium Compound
   And ATE Deaton's sword that day  // No! REALLY! //

   Never touches Imperium Compound

   And its' strange effects on Royalty,

   And by now, it's boring ME!

                recorded: CELTIC CIRCLE DANCE
                          WTP-0002C

        Last night I had the strangest dream in this bleak century
        I dreamed that people the world around believed in Chivalry

        I dreamed I saw a Kingly Crown enshrined in laurel leaves
        with Grace and Joy and Purity attendant at his feet

        I dreamed I saw the perfect Knight receive his accolade
        and minstrels sang and children laughed in some soft forest glade

        I dreamed I saw the finest thing that ever man could make
        grow great and strong and undefiled: Pray God I never wake!

        Last night I had the strangest dream in this bleak century
        I dreamed that people the world around believed in Chivalry

               (to the tune of "Good King Wenceslaus")

                Locksley Monsters never yield
                on the field of battle
                strike the helm and bash the shield
                make their eyeteeth rattle
                Bodies on the ground will lie
                bones will burst in sunder
                search for Locksleys' enemies:
                You'll find them six feet under!

                              SONG OF IVANOF

            There is a man who we know well that does the best he can
            but he's displayed in armour made of reticulated garbage cans!

            He looks so fine and fair and strong, oh how he plays the man
            and how it's prized, those galvanized, reticulated garbage cans

            The noblest Roman of them all, a good Praetorian
            a combatant who wears no pants, judst reticulated garbage cans!

            Like old Horatius at the Bridge, like the Legions of Valerian
            (O dearie me: those LOVELY knees!)
            and those reticulated garbage cans!

                         C. McCray Bethancourt

         (sung to the tune (obviously) of the 12 Days of Christmas)


1.           The first time I sent my device, The Heralds said to me

            "It violates the Rule of Three"

2.           The next time I tried it, the Heralds said to me

            "We changed the forms, and it violates the Rule of
             Three".

3.           The third time I tried, and the Heralds said to me, 

            "We upped the fees, we changed the forms, and it
             violates the Rule of Three".

4.           Another time I tried and the Heralds said to me,
 
            "We haven't got it, we upped the fees, we changed the 
             forms, and it violates the Rule of Three".

5.           The fifth time I tried it, the Heralds said to me,  

            "In a decision rendered by the College of Arms on
             August 1st, A.S. V it was decided that this style of
             heraldic design was not appropriate to the aims and 
             intentions of the Corporate Body. Holy! Holy! Holy! "

 note: verse 5 is delivered in an extremely fast, mono-
       tone, similiar to a Gregorian Chant.

           " ....we haven't got it, we upped the fees, we changed the forms,
             and it violates the Rule of Three."

6.           I tried it a sixth time, and the Heralds said to me,

            "We changed the rules, &c"

7.           A seventh time I tried and, the Heralds said to me,

            "It's against the Rule of Tincture, we changed the
             rules, &c"

8.           I tried it once again and the heralds said to me,

            "It's not a Period design, It's against the Rule of Tincture, We
             changed the rules, &c"

                                * more *



    Heralds Said To Me (cont.)

9.           I sent it in once more, and the Heralds said to me,

            "We changed the rules again, It's not a Period design,
             it's against the Rule of Tincture, we changed the
             rules, &c"

10. (sung in cold anger)
             The LAST time I sent my device, the Heralds said to me

    (sung in a state of SMUG)
             "Someone else has got it, &c"




              (nb: every single one of these reasons has been used by the
              CoA, at one point or another, to reject perfectly good
              heraldry, along with some even MORE stupid.  If the shoe 
              fits....................!!!!!!!!)

                        BUGS ON THE BARONESS
                        Tune: Waltzing Matilda
 
           or: Who was that Vermin I saw you with last, Knight?
   or: There may be Lice on all you Knice, but there ain't no Lice on me

           Once there was a Barony howling in the wilderness
           nestled in the Valley where the River doesn't flow
           and the folks were driven buggy by the insects in the Revel Hall
           Authenticity is wonderful, but this doesn't go!

                   Bugs on the Baroness, bugs on the Baroness!
                   That was the cry that you heard all the day
                   and the scratching can be heard from Ysgithr to Ered Sul
                   why did we come here? Let's go away!

           See them all a scratching, nestled in their armour tight
           the fleas have a melee team that's challenging the field!
           call Truly Nolen! Someone's gotta help us out!
           the crabs are nesting in our helms but we'll never yield!

                   (chorus)

           Dawn comes a-breaking, the bugs have won the Coronet...
           flea-infested Conan-clones in piles upon the lawn
           where is the Barony? The bugs have eaten everyone...
           termites got the stick-jocks, and all their sticks are gone!

                  For all the Lands where I have dwelt
                  Oh Atenveldt, Oh Atenveldt
                  till rivers burn and mountains melt
                  lest I forget my Atenveldt
                  From deserts stark to snow-capped peaks
                  from silent lakes and laughing creeks
                  sing: Oh let man find his heart's ease
                  on rocky plains
                  in desert breeze

                  For oft I thought of mighty men
                  who carved a Land with sword and pen
                  and lit a candle, burning bright,
                  that pierced the darkness; stirred the night!
                  tho some are gone their deeds remain
                  this sunny Crown without a stain
                  sing: Oh, their deeds were not in vain!
                  in sunlit days
                  and falling rain.....

                  So raise your banners, blazoned bright
                  Advance the Dream and Shine the Light!
                  in battle's crash and Revel's song
                  raise high the Flag and wave it long!
                  For all the Lands wherein I've dwelt
                  I love you best, my Atenveldt!
                  Sing: Oh the Joy that I have felt!
                  My Atenveldt
                  My Atenveldt

      What the use of wearing panties
      whalebone corsets of your Auntie's
      boxer shorts and other scanties
      best of all is nude
      there's such fun in going bra-less
      now that it's no longer lawless
      'specially if your figure's flawless
      best of all is nude
      nude is what you're born in
      shirts are never torn in
      underwear and lacy flimsies, garter belts and other whimsies
      yards of itchy cloth to put your form in
      ducks all do it, maidens rue it
      even ancient Picts in Britain blue it
      going naked's how to do it
      best of all is nude!

      If your garters aren't elastic
      tie them up in knots fantastic
      (panty hose is something drastic!)
      best of all is nude!
      If you're tired of wearing clotheses
      shed your garment 'mongst the roses
      never mind the old bluenoses
      best of all is nude!
      Nude is best for ducking!
      Worst for horses bucking!
      Moonlit nights will see such sights
          that are very best for fooling round
                              .....and elbows!
      Nudity is grand to see
       a well-known antidote to virginity
      take your clothes off and you'll see:
      best of all is nude!

                   once I talked to a great Grey Man
                   spun three times and said with a sigh
                   hadn't been for the Runes had his other eye!

                   Hi said the Lady, dressed in green
                   prettiest thing I've ever seen
                   she went down underneath the hill
                   and came back out of her own free will

                   Brian Boru, on Irish ground
                   walked three times the Island round
                   Norsemen came lookin for a fight
                   just another Irish Saturday night!

                   Hi said Lugh on the banquest night
                   a poet and a player and a good wheelwright
                   a harper and a warrior and none the least:
                   a Druid and he got in to the Feast!

                   Harold Haardrada's face was red!
                   Came to Britain and he wound up dead
                   Stamford Bridge is where he's found
                   got six feet of English ground

                   the Legion with it's Eagles bright
                   marched into the Pictish night
                   met them there upon the sand
                   gave em up to the Wicker Man!

                   eight-legged steed and hound of Hel

                   the Circle goes where no man knows

                   Present is Past and Past is Me!

                   Rhiannon's Birds are still in flight

                   sang the Day and sang the Night
                   sang the Land and sang the Sea
                   sang the Song, and then sang Me!

                                  came the Lady to the lea

                                  spread their seeds thruout the Land

                                  saw the Lady where she stood
                                  by the fire burning bright
                                  came to know his heart's delight!

                    WEAPONS AT THE DOOR

 Being a Polemic concerning the alleged Custom of the West Kingdom concerning 
 checking your Weapons at the Door of the Revel Hall. As the Satire is the 
 Weapon of the Bard, this said Polemic is to be checked at the Door, along with 
 swords, knives, redheaded Ladies and other such Deadly Things.....

         As I roved out to Western Lands to take the Western Air
         I went into a Revel Hall and I saw a Twelfth Night there
         but I was halted at the gate by a Privy Consellor
                 (that's the man who tells the King of the West how to go to
                  the bath room!)
         who told me I would have to check my Weapons at the door

         As I, in my astonishment, stood hung on tenter-pegs
         a Knight came in whose Prouess hung down between his legs
         the Doorman grabbed a greatsword and he struck the Knight full sore
         and gave him a reciept; he left his weapon at the door!

         a Bard was next whose goodly Voice has entertained us all
         but he, too, was prevented from entering the Hall
         and told he could not carry deadly weapons on the floor
         he left his Voice and Harp among the weapons at the door

         a Master entered graciously, a man we all know well
         who holds a 3rd Dan Black Belt, tho this he'd never tell
         the Master struggled valiantly, the Master cursed and swore
         but he left his hands, and feet, as weapons at the door

         the company was jovial, altho a bit dismayed
         for lack of proper cutlery, down to the smallest blade
         for even teeth and fingernails, each can be used in War
         were cut, and pulled, and left behind, as weapons at the door!

         And has their King not loyal Knights that He must be afraid
         of brawling in his Hall and of Assassin's bloody blade?
         the Rights of Men to carry Arms at least WE'VE not foreswore
         and a POX on them that made the Rule of Weapons at the Door!

                           THE STREETS OF ANN ARBOR

               As I walked out thru the streets of Ann Arbor
               as I walked out thru Ann Arbor one day
               I spied a young Mongol all dressed in white linen
               all dressed in white linen and cold as the clay

               I then spied another, done in on the sidewalk
               along with just about six dozen more
               their wounds were all gaping, from mace and from braoadsword
               from claymore and cannon, all dripping with gore

               what caused this grave carnage, I cried to the Monglos
               oh pray what's the reason for this awful sight
               my answer came slowly from under the corpse-pile
               "It seems that our bark is much worse than our bite....."

               the answer continued from pale lips a-shaking
               we sang all our songs and believed them as true
               the Dark Horde could never be beaten in battle
               we thought this was what all good Mongols could do...

               we went down to Atenveldt all for to plunder
               "too large to defend" was our song every night
               but Atenveldt's different from East, West or Middle
               there, even the bushes have learned how to bite!

               the Clann stole our ponies, the Scraelings our foodstuffs
               we ran into axes in AtenViking hands
               our maidens ran off with one Richard of Arkham
               and we're all that's left to return to our lands

               MacChluarains and Monsters, Lockehaven and Foxmoor
               that Kingdom is BIG and its' fighters are MEAN!
               we fought and we lost, and fled back to Ann Arbor
               we all came back home with results that you've seen

               keep away from that Land with its' cactus and marshes
               it's no place for Mongols who are bent on War
               they count their blows well, but they strick them yet better
               he crawled into his Yurt, and fell, dead, on the floor.....

       tune: the song of the Cowardly Lion, Tin Woodsman and Scarecrow
             in the movie version of the Wizard of Oz

        (Enter the Scarecrow, who singeth:)

        My wife is always nagging; my Prowess it is lagging
        I can't do anything
        she has got a reason, but revenge is out of season
        Oh I wish I could be King!

        If I just had the Crown on, I'd always have a frown on
        and the Barons on a string
        Heads they would be rolling, the Board would be cajoling
        Oh if only I was King!

        I am very fed up with the way this group is set up
        Oh I'd change everything!
        they are so high and mighty with the way that they do fight-ey
        Oh, someday I'll be King!

        Tho my wife is melancholic, and very...vitriolic
        she's a wasp without a sting!
        I'd have to supervise her with a pack of tranquilizers
        If I only was a King......

        (the Tin Woodsman joineth him, and singeth:)

        I grew up kind of cocky, and rather big, and stocky
        and straight as any rod
        on the field I'm a battallion, with the Ladies I'm a stallion
        ...Oh they'd better make me God!

        The other boys are jealous they say I'm over-zealous
        they'd do better to applaud
        the things that I am giving to this Dream that we are living
        oh I wish they'd make me God!

        They say that I'm conceited, but I'm just badly treated
        by people and by BoD
        just think of what they're missing by My Majesty dismissing
        Oh they'd better make me God!

        (the Cowardly Lion creepeth forth, and singeth:)

        Oh I could be a fighter, a great and mighty smiter
        and be the perfect knight
        it's a great and nasty shame, and everyone's to blame
        oh I wish that I could fight!

        Song of the Three (cont.)

        I could be a Cavalier drinking wine and ale and beer
        and be a gorgeous sight
        but it would cost me too much money so it isn't very funny
        oh I wish that I could fight!                               

        Let me at 'em on the field, I would surely make them yield
        to my Power and my Might
        with rattan, shinai and rapier they would nevermore escape here
        If they'd only let me fight

                She was worried that "something might show.."
                She was afraid to come out to the Tourney

                One day in the Kingdom of the Middle
                It happened at a Tourney one day:
                The Mongols invaded the Middle
                But the Middle did not want to play...

                  (eins - zwei - drei, but the Dark Horde wouldn't die!)

          It's rude and rusty, grim and bad, and squeaky like a door-hinge,
          But I'm a better Bard than you: I found a rhyme for "orange!"

                      by William Poundstone
                              1983

     Two mentalities are at work here: 1960s rock fans and 1980s
fundamentalist Christians. The idea of phonographically concealed
messages dates from the Paul McCartney death scare of 1969. For
hard-core types, the secret-message rumors never really died. Avid
rock fans have auditioned ever album release since the late 1960s
for hidden nuances. Backward messages, barely audible messages,
and messages on one stereo track only have been alleged. At the
other end of the sociosensual spectrum, fundamentalist Christians
have gotten into the act. TV programs such as PRAISE THE LORD and
THE 700 CLUB have propagated rumors of a satanic plot in the
recording industry, no less, in which various albums conceal
"backward-masked" demonic murmurings. If THAT sounds too spacey to
be taken seriously, consider that it was the fundamentalist groups
who were behind House Resolution 6363, a bill introduced in the
U.S. House of Representatives by Robert K. Dornan (R., Calif.) in
1982 to label all suspect records: "WARNING: THIS RECORD CONTAINS
BACKWARD MASKING THAT MAKES A VERBAL STATEMENT WHICH IS AUDIBLE
WHEN THIS RECORD IS PLAYED BACKWARD AND WHICH MAY BE PERCEPTIBLE
AT A SUBLIMINAL LEVEL WHEN THIS RECORD IS PLAYED FORWARD." In
February 1983, the Arkansas State Senate passed a similar record-
labeling bill by a vote of 86 to 0.
     Contributing to the quasi-occult status of these rumors is
the difficulty of checking them out on home audio equipment. You
pretty much have to take someone else's word for it, or dismiss
the rumors out of hand.
     From a technical standpoint, there are four simple ways to
conceal a verbal message on a recording. The most obvious is to
record the message at a very low volume. The message may then be
recovered by turning the volume up while playing the record or
tape. If the message is faint enough, though, noise levels of home
equipment may garble it. If the accompanying music or lyrics are
loud enough, or if the message itself is indistinct or
electronically modified, it may be hard to hear on any equipment.
     A second gimmick is to record a message on one stereo track
only. Records and tapes have two independent recordings, of
course, normally played simultaneously for stereo effect. On a
record, each stereo track occupies on one side of the V-shaped
groove for the needle. On a tape, the tracks are recorded in
parallel lanes of the magnetic material. The two tracks are called
"right" and "left" after the stereo speakers they will play on.
Otherwise, the tracks are interchangeable -- the sound mixer can
put anything he or she wants on each track. A message on one track
can be masked by simultaneous loud music or lyrics on the opposite
track. With normal stereo balance (or mono equipment) the loud
track drowns out the message track. At home, single-track messages
can be recovered by adjusting the stereo balance so that only the
desired track plays. Sometimes this trick also makes indistinct
words clearer. Even if the words are not exclusively on one track,
they may happen to be more audible on one track.
     A message could be recorded at a speed different from the
rest of the record. Then the record would have to be played faster
or slower than usual to recover the message. Unless the message
was at one of the standard speeds (say, 45 rpm on a 33 1/3 rpm
record), it could not be played normally on home equipment.
     The fourth and most commonly alleged trick is to record a
verbal message backward. Reversed speech has several unexpected
features. One is that syllables are not a constant in the reversal
process. A one-syllable word can have two or three syllables when
played backward. Thus "number nine" in the Beatles' REVOLUTION 9
reverses to "Turn me on, dead man" (or something like it), a jump
from three to five syllables.
     There is no simple way to predict what a word or phrase will
sound like reversed. Obviously, you can't just reverse the
letters.
     Reversed messages are difficult to recover at home. Record
turntables are not built to go backwards. Some have a neutral
setting, in which the pickup and amplifier remain active and you
can turn the record backward by hand. But hardly anyone has a
stead enough hand to produce satisfactory results.
     With patience, it is possible to reverse a cassette
recording. Transfer the music from the original record or tape
onto a blank tape cassette. Place the cassette flat on a table.
Draw our the part of the tape with the suspected message and snip
it off at both ends. Hold the tape segment horizontally. Rotate it
180 degrees, keep it horizontal at all times. This turns the tape
end for end. Splice the reversed tape segment back onto the two
loose ends of the cassette with strong adhesive tape. Reel the
tape back inside the cassette. The sliced segment will play
backward on an ordinary cassette player.
     I rented a recording studio to test the secret-message
rumors. New copiies of the records in question were transcribed on
a quarter-inch master tape. Where rumor alleged that a single
stereo track contained a message, right and left stereo tracks
were transcribed separately. Records with alleged inaudible
messages were treated similarly. To test claims of reversed
messages, recordings on the master tape were edited out and
spliced in backward. Twenty cuts or portions of cuts from sixteen
albums were tested.


"Another One Bites the Dust"
Queen, THE GAME

Rumor: When played backward, the lyrics say, "It's fun to smoke
marijuana."
Findings: There is something that sounds like "It's fun to smoke
marijuana" in the reversed music. It is repeated over and over. It
might be rendered no less faithfully, however, as "sfun to scout
mare wanna." This "message" is the reversal of the song title,
which is repeated as a line in the song.
     Let's make a distinction between engineered and phonetic
reversals. When an artist records a verbal statement, reverses it
by turning the tape end for end, mixes the reversed statement onto
a master tape, and has records and tapes produced from the master,
that is an engineered reversal. When the phonetic properties of
song lyrics are such that they can be reversed to sound like
something else, that is a phonetic reversal.
     "It's fun to smoke marijuna" is clearly a phonetic reversal.
The lyrics are perfectly plain played forward ("Another one bites
the dust"), no so plain played backward ("sfun to scout mare
wanna"). With an engineered reversal, the opposite should hold
true: gibberish forward, clear as a bell backward. Some are
prepared to believe that phonetic reversals are just as
intentional as engineered reversals -- that the songwriter
painstakinginly planned the phonetic double-entendre. In the
absence of confirming evidence, that just doesn't wash. It's too
easy to find coincidences. If, for example, the letters of the
alphabet are recited in conventional fashion (Ay, Bee, Cee, etc.)
and reversed, at least five sound like English language words. D
reverses to "eden," F becomes "pray," S becomes "say," V becomes
"even," and Z becomes "easy." "It's fun to smoke marijuana" is
likewise a coincidence.


"A Child is Coming"
Jefferson Starship, BLOWS AGAINST THE EMPIRE

Rumor: When played backward, "son of Satan."
Findings: Another phonetic coincidence. The repeated "It's getting
better" reverses to an iffy "son of Satan," the "of" drawn out and
the "Satan" strongly accented on the first syllable.


"Eldorado"
Electric Light Orchestra, ELDORADO

Rumor: When played backward, "He is the nasty one/ Christ, you're
infernal/ It is said we're dead men/ Everyone who has the mark
will live."
Findings: Coincidence. The supposed message lurks around the line
"On a voyage of no return to see." Reversed, this passage becomes
the expected syllable salad -- no one hearing it would describe it
as anything but reversed music. Only if you listen while reading
along with what you're supposed to hear will you get anything. The
rumored version of the message is somewhat fudged. The passage
sounds more like "He's to nasty one/ Christ you are, Christ,
you're fernal/ There wiss uh, we're dead men..." There is no "in"
in what is taken to be "infernal." The line that is supposed to be
"Everyone who has the mark will live" isn't even close, though the
syllable count is right.


"Shoo Be Doo"
The Cars, CANDY-O

Rumor: When played backward, the word "Satan" repeated
approximately eleven times.
Findings: Coincidence. The rumor refers to the reversal of the "Shoo
be doo, shoo be doo, shoo be doo..." near the end of the song. Given
the mysterious logic of reversed phonemes, these three-syllable units
can be hard as a repeated two-syllable word. The word sounds a little
like "Satan."


"Snowblind"
Styx, PARADISE THEATER

Rumor: According to a mimeographed list of suspect records distributed
by Congressman Dornan, the words "Satan move through our voices" when
played backwards.
Findings: Negative. Despite repeated listenings, it was not even
possible to identify the part of the reversed track that Dornan et al.
are talking about.


"Stairway to Heaven"
Led Zeppelin, untitled, a.k.a. STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN

Rumor: In reverse, "I live for Satan... The Lord turns me off...
There's no escaping it... Here's to my sweet Satan... There's power in
Satan... He will give you 666."
Findings: Coincidence. If you listen very carefully to the "And it
makes me wonder" lines in reverse, you'll hear something approaching
"There's no escaping it." A better description is "There's no escape
do." Knock of the last syllable, and you have "There's no escape," a
complete, intelligible sentence in reverse. It's there, all right, but
it's not an unlikely enough coincidence to -- well, make you wonder.
      The "Satan" in "I live for Satan" is good and clear. The "I live
for" part isn't. The other alleged lines are unremarkable. All are
phonetic reversals of the entirely lucid forward lyrics and obviously
just accidents.


"When Electricity Came to Arkansas"
Black Oak Arkansas, BLACK OAK ARKANSAS and RONCH AND ROLL

Rumor: In reverse, "Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan. He is God. He
is God."
Findings: The BLACK OAK ARKANSAS cut was reversed. Again, pairs of
reversed syllables are being freely interpreted as "Satan." "He is
God" was not identifiable.


"Rain"
The Beatles, HEY JUDE

Rumor: Unintelligible lyrics at the end are reversed.
Findings: A true engineered reversal and not really a secret. "Rain"
seems to have been the first popular recording to incorporate an
obviously reversed lyric. The story is that John Lennon accidentally
spliced the last part of the song in backward and liked the effect.
When reversed, the strange-sounding vocals at the end become
intelligible as a reprise starting with the drawn-out word
"sunshine."
      The reversal is less apparent to the casual listener than it
might be because the accompanying music is not reversed. The ending
fits in smoothly with the rest of the song, the vocals suggesting a
foreign language.


"Fire on High"
Electric Light Orchestra, FACE THE MUSIC

Rumor: When played backward, "The music is reversible, but time --
turn back!"
Findings: "Fire on High" is instrumental. About twenty-six seconds
into the music, scrambled speech is heard. It is mostly louder than
the accompanying music and begins with a two-syllable unit repeated
several times. The seeming speech lasts for about fourteen seconds.
      Reversing the music confirms that there is a true, engineered
message. In reverse, a voice (Jeff Lynne's?) says, "The music is
reversible, but time -- turn back! Turn back! Turn back! Turn back!"
All the words are clear and unambiguous. Anyone comparing this to the
alleged reversal on ELO's "Eldorado" will have no trouble telling
which is genuine.


"Goodbye Blue Sky"
Pink Floyd, THE WALL

Rumor: In reverse, "You have discovered the secret message."
Findings: The "secret message" is at the very end of the instrumental
passage following the "Goodbye Blue Sky" vocals. It comes just before
the words "What shall we do" at the start of the song that is
identified as "Empty Spaces" on the record label and as "What shall we
do now?" on the record sleeve. Played forward, the message is less
apparent than the FACE THE MUSIC reversal: A reasonably attentive
listener might play THE WALL through and not catch it. It suggests
speech not quite close enough to be overheard. In context this is not
unusual because the "Goodbye Blue Sky" instrumental passage includes
"airport noises" and other sound effects. A loud climax in the music
further masks the unintelligible voice.
      When played backward, the voice (Roger Waters?) plainly intones,
"Congratulations, you have just discovered the secret message. Please
send your answer to old Pink, care of the funny farm..." As the voice
fades out, there may be another word -- perhaps "Chalfonte or
"Chelsea" -- after "funny farm."


"Heavy Metal Poisoning"
Styx, KILROY WAS HERE

Rumor: A red sticker on the KILROY WAS HERE cover warns, "By order of
the Majority for Musical Morality, this album contains secret backward
messages..."
Findings: This is a case of second-generation backward-masking. Styx'
PARADISE THEATER did not contain a backward message, though a lot of
people said it did. So Styx has included a sure enough backward
message on KILROY WAS HERE. It is at the very beginning of "Heavy
Metal Poisoning." The reversed speech last about three seconds. There
is no musical background. The words reverse to "Annuit coeptis. Novus
ordo seclorum." This is the Latin motto encircling the pyramid on the
back of a dollar bill. The usual translation: "God has favored our
undertakings. A new order of the ages."
      The cover sticker's "Majority for Musical Morality" is a
fictitious Falwellesque group in the KILROY WAS HERE video. Although
the sticker suggests a plurality of "messages," only one was found.


Space between "I'm So Tired" and "Blackbird"
The Beatles, untitled, a.k.a. THE WHITE ALBUM

Rumor: A reversed message. At the time of the Paul-is-dead stories,
the segue from "I'm So Tired" to "Blackbird" was offered as evidence.
It was held to contain John Lennon's voice, reveresed, saying "Paul is
dead, miss him, miss him, miss him." That interpretation seems
unlikely now, but there is a mysterious low muttering between the
songs.
Findings: The mumbling is actually just to the "I'm So Tired" side of
the shiny "space" between cuts on the record. Each of the stereo
tracks was recorded separately, twice, and a copy of each track was
reversed. This produced four versions of the two-second passage: right
forward, left forward, right reversed, and left reversed. All were
equally unintelligible. It was not even apparent whether the voice is
forward or reversed. Nor could John Lennon be identified as the
speaker. There are nine or ten syllables. The first six (when played
forward) are a two-syllable unit repeated three times. There is little
or no difference betwen the stereo tracks. Any claimed interpretation
of the sounds seems doubtful.


"Strawberry Fields Forever"
The Beatles, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR

Rumor: It was, of course, claimed that John Lennon says "I buried
Paul" at the end. (It's forward, at the very end after the music
fades to complete silence, returns, and starts to fade out again.)
But Lennon told ROLLING STONE that the words are "cranberry
sauce."
Findings: They are "cranberry sauce." The "sauce"/"Paul" part is
indistinct, but the first syllable sounds a lot more like "cran"
than "I."


"Baby You're a Rich Man"
The Beatles, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR

Rumor: On one of the tracks the line "Baby you're a rich man too"
is sung as "Baby you're a rich fag Jew," a dig at Brian Epstein.
Or some think it's "rich fat Jew" and claim it as evidence of
Beatle anti-Semitism.
Findings: Negative. The two stereo tracks are nearly identical.
It's always possible to hear words as similar-sounding words, but
basically, the lyrics jibe with the published version.


"Revolution 9"
The Beatles, untitled, a.k.a. THE WHITE ALBUM

Rumor: Various reversed and/or one-track speech. The reversal of
"Number nine" to "Turn me on, dead man" has pretty much been
discounted as coincidence (though it appears on Congressman
Dornan's list).
Findings: Distinction between lyrics and any hidden message blurs
on "Revolution 9." The eight-minute cut is a montage of sounds
collected by John Lennon and Yoko Ono. It includes discordant
music, radio broadcasts, sirens, applause, gunfights, sports
cheers, the crackling of a fire, screams, a baby gurgling, a choir
singing, and much that cannot be identified. For this
investigation, "Revolution 9" was transcribed four times, twice on
each stereo channel. One copy of each of the tracks was reversed.
The four resulting versions were compared with each other and
against the original two-channel version.
     "Revolution 9" contains a lot of talking. Played in stereo,
forward, the longest stretch of understandable speech is probably
an announcer saying, "...every one of them knew that as time went
by they'd get a little bit older and a little bit slower..."
     One believable instance of reversed speech occurs: someone
saying "Let me out! Let me out!" (once held to represent McCartney
in his totaled Aston-Martin). Two iffy reversals occur on the
backward recording of the right stereo track:"She used to be
assistant" and "There were two men..." Neither is clear enough or
long enough to be convincing. Some of the music, including the
recurring theme, sounds more natural in reverse.
     "Turn me on, dead man" is a typical phonetic reversal. The
forward "number nine" (repeated throughout the cut) is clear; the
reversal is slurred -- something like "turn me on dedmun." It has
been claimed that "number nine" must be pronounced with a British
accent or with some careful inflection in order to reverse to
"Turn me on, dead man." This seems not to be so. As an experiment,
three American-accent renderings of "number nine" were reversed.
All sound about as much like "Turn me on, dead man" as the record
did. Like the other phonetic reversals, "Turn me on, dead man"
must be considered a coincidence.
     Much of "Revolution 9" is on one stereo track only. Near the
end a voice says "A fine natural imbalance...the Watusi...the
twist...Eldorado...Eldorado." "A fine natural imbalance" is on the
right track only, though the words that follow are in stereo. One
of the longer bits of speech -- "Who could tell what he was
saying? His voice was low and his [unintelligible] was high and
his eyes were low" -- is clear on the left track, a bare whisper
on the right.
     There is a stereophonically concealed "secret message" on
"Revolution 9." The words are on the right track. They begin about
four minutes, fifty-eight seconds into the cut and run for about
twenty-two seconds. They are not likely to be noticed in stereo
because of the much louder left track. The sound of applause
begins on the left track at about five minutes, one second into
the cut. Deafening noises -- the clapping, sirens, music --
continue on the left track until five minutes, forty seconds. It
may or may not have been Lennon's and Ono's intention to conceal
the spoken passage. Given the haphazard quality of "Revolution 9,"
the concealment may have been accidental. To recover the passage,
the left track must be switched off. The right track can then be
heard to contain a sound like a stopwatch ticking, behind these
words:

     So the wife called, and we better go to see a
     surgeon....[A SCREAM MUFFLES A LINE THAT SOUNDS LIKE
     Well, what with the prices, the prices have snowballed,
     no wonder it's closed.] ...So any and all, we went to
     see the dentist instead, who gave him a pair of teeth,
     which wasn't any good at all. So instead of that he
     joined the bloody navy and went to sea.
                      by William Poundstone
                              1986

     There really are backward messages on rock albums. And the
controversy over "backward masking" and "porn rock" has inspired a
whole new spate of messages. There may have been more genuine
backward messages in the past few years than ever before.
     The backward message controversy is usually traced to the
1960s and John Lennon's avant-garde sound mixing on such tracks as
"Revolution 9" on the Beatles' WHITE ALBUM. Lennon probably wasn't
trying to conceal a message so much as create an interesting
sound.
     The matter might have ended right there had it not been for
the Paul McCartney death rumor. College kids tried playing Beatles
records forward, backward, and at various speeds to find "clues"
to McCartney's fate. In the process they found snippets of speech
from Lennon's experiments. Even after McCartney was found safe and
sound in Scotland, some listeners continued to look for hidden
messages.
     Somehow, fundamentalist Christian groups became convinced
(ca. 1982) that the alleged messages were commercials for devil
worship. Not a single indisputable satanic message has turned up,
but there were scattered attempts to ban or label certain albums.
In 1986 one fundamentalist group announced that the theme song for
the old MR. ED TV show contains the word "Satan" when played
backward.)
     Ironically, the publicity accorded nonexistent messages has
inspired several artists -- among them porn rock hearing witness
Frank Zappa -- to hide real background messages in their music.
It's easy to do.
     The performer speaks or sings the message normally, then
reverses the tape, which is mixed into the soundtrack. This is all
accomplished simply enough at any recording studio.
     What's not so simple is playing it back. More home record,
cassette, and compact disk players won't play backward. You can
turn a record backward with a pencil eraser, but it's not good for
the needle or the turntable. The only way to reproduce the message
with full fidelity is to use a professional-quality reel-to-reel
tape player and splice the tape in backward.
     We used the facilities of KLOS radio in Los Angeles to
reverse some recent records containing true backward messages.


"Secret Messages"
Electric Light Orchestra, SECRET MESSAGES

ELO's ELDORADO album was among those alleged to contain satanic
backward masked messages. A patient listening to ELDORADO played
backward reveals no such messages. You hear only what you ought to
hear -- the reversed lyrics of the songs, which sound nothing like
the "messages" claimed to be there. In the wake of such
allegations, ELO did put an (innocuous) backward message on their
FACE THE MUSIC album. Perhaps they thought this would show how
silly the allegations were. Instead, the backward-masking people
seized on this as proof that the other "messages" were real. In
the latest volley, ELO has named an album after the controversy.
     In Britain (where the backward-masking issue is viewed as an
American eccentricity), the cover of SECRET MESSAGES has a mock
warning label to youth about the hidden label. Word of the albums'
impending release in the United States caused enough of a furor to
chill CBS Records into deleting the cover blurb.
     The reversed message is easy to find. It's at the beginning
of the first song, which is itself called "Secret Messages." You
can hear reversed speech when you play the record normally. A
voice intones "secret messages" -- forward -- in the middle of the
reversed speech, lest anyone dare be so unhip as to not know
what's going on.
     We transferred a new copy of SECRET MESSAGES to reel-to-reel
tapes and played it backward. The backward message goes: "WELCOME
TO THE BIG SHOW/ WELCOME TO THE BIG SHOW."
     That's it.


"Ya Hozna"
Frank Zappa, THEM OR US

"Ya Hozna," a six-minute composition on the first record of the
THEM OR US double album, is ENTIRELY backward. The albums' inner
cover, which includes lyrics for the other songs, says, "backwards
vocal -- you figure it out" of this cut. It credits Frank and Moon
Zappa, George Duke, and Napoleon Murphy Brock as vocalists.
     Played forward, "Ya Howza" sounds like a record played
backward -- reasonably so. The vocals are prominent and
unintelligible. Moon Zappa's voice is curiously recognizable, even
in reverse. It is hard to tell whether the music was recorded
forward or backward.
     When "Ya Howza" is played in reverse, you discover that the
music is virtually a palindrome -- it sounds about the same
forward and backward. The voices are all backward. In some cases
they have been modified electronically. Many of the words are
muffled. Even after repeated careful listening on both stereo
tracks, it is difficult to make out many of the lyrics. It doesn't
help that some of the words seem to be stream-of-consciousness
nonsense. Some of the unintelligible stuff sounds like opera.
     Starting at the beginning of the reversed tape -- the end of
the forward tape -- the clearer vocals go like this: "I am the
heaven, I am the water." This is in a hymnlike register. "You are
a lonely little girl./ But your mommy and your daddy hold you." A
singsong synthesizer voice.
     The most interesting part of the lyrics is an intermittently
orgasmic rap in Moon Zappa's Valley Girl voice. There are three
short monologues:

I'm like green!
I'm like squat!
I'm like soul!
Repeat, like soul!
I'm like pull, push,
Okay, like slow, slow.

You're never too old
Like slow, like slow, like slow
Okay, I like it.


All right, faster, faster,
Go, do it, do it twice,
Yeah, that feels good,
I'm looking great,
Yeah, fer shure!
Like, no way!


"No Anchovies, Please"
J. Geils Band, LOVE STINKS

"No Anchovies, Please" is a novelty song, really a narration with
sound effects, about a woman who is kidnapped after eating
anchovies. She is taken to a "foreign-speaking" country. The sound
effect of the foreign tongue seems reversed. When you do play it
in reverse, it becomes: "It doesn't take a genius to know the
difference between chicken shit and chicken salad."


"Darling Nikki"
Prince, PURPLE RAIN

"Darling Nikki," cited as porn rock before Congress, is about a
dominatrix in a hotel lobby masturbating with a magazine. In part,
the complaint was that the album cover (flowers, and Prince on a
motorcycle) wasn't explicit enough to warn kids of the suggestive
lyrics. Senator Paula Hawkins apparently was not aware of a
backward message hidden in "Darling Nikki." The last thirty-five
seconds of the song is gibberish. The music changes abruptly and
becomes a repeated glottal sound. Then a two-syllable sound is
repeated twice, something like "heaven, heaven." Unintelligible
speech follows. At the end is a sound reminiscent of rain or bacon
frying , and wind sounds.
     Played backward, the message becomes:

     Hello, how are you?
     I'm fine 'cause I know that the Lord is coming soon.
     Coming, coming soon.

     It is clearly Prince and the Revolution singing this. The
words are clear but the intonation is funny -- the linger on some
words. Perhaps this is to make the reversed message you hear
playing the record normally a little less conspicuous.
     This is a weird reversal of the supposed secret message
menace. Raunchy forward lyrics conceal a religious secret message.


"Judas Kiss"
Petra, MORE POWER TO YOU

Petra is an obscure group that sings religious songs to a rock
beat. As further proof that things have gone full circle, the
backward-masking controversy prompted Petra to include a wholesome
backward message on their MORE POWER TO YOU album. It is in the
transition between two songs, just before "Judas Kiss." Clearly
audible gibberish reverses to this (the husky voice a cross
between George Beverly Shea and Dee Snider): "What are you looking
for the Devil for, when you ought to be looking for the Lord?"

AFL JoyceM Welcome to the Apple II Music & Sound chat - our discussion will
           be on NoiseTracker - the new FTA music program for the GS.  AFA
           Gene will be our host this evening...Gene, the floor is yours :)

AFA Gene   Hi all... well first I'd like to point out, if y'all aren't aware
           yet, that a spanking new version of NoiseTracker has recently
           been released (9 days ago) and is now available in our New Files
           library. It is version 0.5. I haven't played around with it much
           yet, but it's supposed to fix a lot of the little bugs in 0.3
           (the first version we had online).  NoiseTracker also includes
           the ability to directly import "modules," a term used for a
           certain type of Amiga song file which has become popular among PC
           users using the SoundBlaster sound card.

           Now, via NT, these "MOD" files are accessible by the GS. We
           expect to see a lot of activity on this end as far as ports from
           the PC and Amiga go. Note that you should be able to go straight
           to the PC music forum and download any recently uploaded MOD
           songfiles (there was a bug in the first wide release of the PCAO
           software, however, so a bunch of files with dates between around
           March 1991 and September 1991 may not download properly. Note that
           to use these PC MOD files, you'll have to rename the downloaded
           file "MOD.xxxxxx" if you want it to show up automatically in NT's
           "open" dialog box. (On the PC, all MOD files are named
           "xxxxxxxx.MOD" instead.)   Also, if the files are packed with ZIP
           compression, you'll need a program from the Communications Forum
           called AGATE -- it's a terminal program that includes the ability
           to unpack ZIP files.

           Now, I guess the best thing to do would be to talk about our
           favorite songfiles... there have been a few complaints, in fact,
           that people were not being "descriptive" enough in their file
           descriptions for uploads in describing the songs.

AFC Eddie  ?

AFA Gene   GA ed

AFC Eddie  Once a MOD file is unpacked with Agate, is a file type change
           needed?

AFA Gene   Nope, since all that NT looks for is the "MOD." being the first
           four characters in the filename.

AFC Eddie  OK, Thanks!

Deanna7332 Question...

JonL7      Can you list some of the features of Noisetracker?

AFA Gene   (you don't even need that "MOD." if you want to type the name in
           directly.)

Deanna7332 Did any of these mod files have anything to do with FTA's "Module
           A"

AFA Gene   Sure Jon, right after we answer Deanna's question. Deanna, you
           mean "Modulae?"

Deanna7332 Yes, that's it.

AFA Gene   Modulae was a demo written by FTA last year. (i'll get to you in a
           sec Doors).  It used SoundSmith v0.95 for all it's music. There
           is no connection between MOD files and Modulae by FTA.

Deanna7332 Throughout the demo it said "Loading modules"

AFA Gene   Those "modules" are not the same as Amiga soundfile "modules" --
           you see, what Modulae really was was a "stringing together" of a
           bunch of neat little tiny demos that FTA had written. So they
           called each little demo a "module" and thus the entire demo as a
           whole, "Modulae" (fancy plural of module?)

Deanna7332 Ok I understand.  Thank you. :)

AFL JoyceM Latin, Gene :)

AFA Gene   The term "MODule" from the Amiga comes from the idea that all the
           stuff needed to play the songfile (all the instruments + the
           sequence file) are included into one file, the "module."

TheDoors1  Gene, I have tried to d/l some recent uploaded MODs in the PC
           music area and still the problem exists.

AFA Gene   As I understand it, the problem was fixed VERY recently (correct
           me on this Joyce) and files uploaded as recently as early
           November still might not work depending on the version of the
           PCAO software that the uploader used.

AFL JoyceM Actually, Gene...I was under the impression that it had been, but
           if Doors is still having a problem, then it must not be fixed.

AFA Gene   What date was the file you tried to d/l, Door?

TheDoors1  umm 11/17, around there

AFA Gene   hmmm.... well i can tell you one thing... if it didn't work, don't
           waste your time again later... the problem is in the Apple
           software's method of d/lling files, and there are no plans to
           upgrade the Apple AO software.

AFL JoyceM I will endeavor to get an answer to that PC downloading
           problem/question :)

ThomasK63  i have a quick question... what can you use to unpack amiga mod
           files? On the PC side, that is.

TheDoors1  Agate Thomas

ELECTMUSIC Doors... what happens on after downloading..

Deanna7332 If it's LZHed you can't unless you have an IBM or
           PC/Transporter.

AFA Gene   If GS-ShrinkIt doesn't have that ability, i don't think there
           exists any such utility on the GS.

TheDoors1  What do you mean Elect?

ELECTMUSIC After you download the file... where do you encounter a problem?

TheDoors1  ok, you know when you download the file and at some point in the
           download the file starts to appear on your screen.  That's when I
           cancel it.

ThomasK63  I am sure soething good can be made w/out resorting to Amiga
           files

AFC Eddie  Yes, Doors, I believe the problem is with the PC software it was
           UL'd with.

TheDoors1  yeah Eddie.

GNO Tim    Amiga MOD files are typically compressed using LHarc.  I've
           uncompressed several on my Unix machine at school.

ThomasK63  good time for someone to make a lharc unpacker...

AFC DYAJim someone might be ;)

GNO Tim    Several people are already

AFC Eddie  Can't wait, Jim!

AFA Gene   Jon, did you have a question?

JonL7      The features of Noisetracker :)

AFA Gene   Oh yes... okay, here goes, in a nutshell, from most important to
           least:


AFA Gene   *  ability to import MOD files

           *  ability to import Soundsmith files

           *  ProDOS 8 based

           *  virtually no editing abilities (not a feature but important to
           know)

AFC DYAJim :)

AFA Gene   *  forgot: and the most important feature of all, the ability to
           hold instrument files in regular system RAM instead of DOC RAM,
           allowing for instruments far beyond the regular 64K limit found
           in ALL other GS music programs.

ThomasK63  I'll buy that!

TheDoors1  I have another question...when you're ready.

AFA Gene   GA Doors

TheDoors1  ok..is it true that NoiseTracker will take in soundsmith files and
           play them more clearly

AFA Gene   Well, as far as "what you hear," yes there is a definite
           difference with some instruments. It does NOT play the sounds
           more "clearly," but it just plays them in a different way. What
           many people seem to like about this "different way" is that
           sustained instruments (i.e. instruments designed to be played
           in a loop to simulate a long held note) seem to work better (or
           perhaps simply the way they were originally intended to work).

TheDoors1  I see

Deanna7332 Which takes up more space - MOD or NT  w/soundfile ?

AFA Gene   Deanna, it depends a few things, such as how big the sequence is,
           how many instruments you have, etc. Once you have a lot of
           assorted files, it'll probably average out to be about the same
           give or take a hundred blocks on your HD. So it basically depends
           on whether you prefer to have your instruments separate or not.

Deanna7332 Does playing quality differ with either one ?

AFA Gene   Nope. It's exactly the same either way. Loading time is the same
           too.

AFC Eddie  Can NT save songs as MOD files?

AFA Gene   Nope. It has options for Open and Close module, but these are
           still inactive.

AFA Gene   If there are no more questions, I'd like to talk about which NT
           files out there are the "hottest," since this info could be
           useful to many users who are interested in downloading NT/MOD
           files.

           My personal favorite is "Lambada," which is supplied by FTA with
           the program but is available separately on America
           Online.Everything about this file is really impressive except
           perhaps the sound quality of the horn-ish melody instrument.

           What about y'all, what are your favorite NT files?

AFL JoyceM Gene, there is a classical song for NT, but can't remember the
           name, but it is good.

AFC Eddie  I like Dragnet!

ELECTMUSIC So do I Ed

TheDoors1  I like Seven something

Deanna7332 My most favorite of all mod files is Pleasure Principle

AFC Eddie  <--appreciate's Greg's taste!

AFL JoyceM :)

AFA Gene   Deanna, i assume you got that from a local board?

Deanna7332 I got it from the PC forum here.

TheDoors1  I saw it there also

Deanna7332 I think under "Pleasure"

AFA Gene   Would you be able to upload it here? If it's really that good, we
           ought to have it available directly in our oun NT lib here (BTW
           folks, we will be releasing a new NoiseTracker software library
           soon!)

AFC Eddie  What a Forum!!!

Deanna7332 That sounds great!

AFL JoyceM Gene, do you think it will be possible for synthLAB files to be
           converted to MOD files?

AFL JoyceM MOD files?

AFA Gene   I doubt it, Joyce. The formats are so diametrically opposed in
           their entire basis of their file formats that it wouldn't be
           worth the time for a programmer to develop such a convertor.

Deanna7332 Isn't it possible to move the mod file from the PC forum to our
           music library?

AFA Gene   But..... it might be worth the time for a MIDI File Format to MOD
           convertor, since these two formats are more widely accepted.

Nuzz       they have nothing better to do Gene

ELECTMUSIC Gene.. some interesting similarities with DTune and NTracker

AFA Gene   They lose the file, tho, Deanna. :)

AFL JoyceM In what way, Greg?

ELECTMUSIC Both Prodos 8

Deanna7332 Shhh they won't know a thing :)

ELECTMUSIC I also believe Bill uses a shuttling of sound data between Doc
           Ram and Ram.

AFC Eddie  Interesting, Greg.

ELECTMUSIC Thats how he gets some of the excellent instrument quality

AFC Eddie  But Diversitune has that one distinction:  MIDI input.

AFL JoyceM Deanna, we would greatly appreciate it if you would upload that
           'Pleasure' song to our library :)

ELECTMUSIC Agreed Ed.. one of the factors FTA doesn't like to incorporate
           into their programs.

Deanna7332 I'll u/l it tonight if possible.

AFL JoyceM Thanks :)

AFC Eddie  Thanks, Deanna!

AFL JoyceM I will send Bill B a copy of NoiseTracker + some MOD files...to
           see what comments we get from him (will send when I get back).

AFC DYAJim What ever happened to that diversitune upgrade that was talked
           about ?

ELECTMUSIC That would be interesting Joyce

AFC Eddie  Bill apparently still working on it, Jim.

ELECTMUSIC I am sure he would appreciate the Prodos 8

AFC DYAJim good..

AFL JoyceM Jim...RSN....he was hoping by Christmas (this year), but he is
           soooo busy with his job, who knows?

AFC DYAJim Oh yeah, I noticed the speed calcuation in NT .5 is inaccurate
           :)

AFC DYAJim I recall he has set a lot of Christmas projected dates :)

ELECTMUSIC He was one of the first "Free Tools" experts in breaking all the
           rules for economic sake.

AFC DYAJim like for the vaporware DT inst editor like 2 years ago.

Deanna7332 Are there any Christmas Mod or NT songs?

AFC Eddie  Oh yeah, Diversi-Editor!

AFL JoyceM I know, Jim - but that I know he has been working on.

AFC DYAJim he projected Christmas for it, and it never came :)

AFA Gene   Not yet in AMS, but hopefully the Holiday Contest will change all
           that. :)

AFC DYAJim I look foreward to any upgrades..

AFL JoyceM Not that I am aware of Deanna - you have some?  hint, hint

Deanna7332 Nope sorry.  I was hoping there were some that could be u/led
           here

AFC DYAJim I'll be breaking out the xmas tune book rsn.. I should be able to
           midi a few :) (which rules out nt)

AFL JoyceM Question...

AFC Eddie  It would be more appropriate to have a converter from Appleworks
           spreadsheet to MOD than from MIDI!

AFL JoyceM If I got ahold of an Amiga song (MOD) disk...how would I convert
           them for here?

AFA Gene   You mean an Amiga-formatted disk?

AFL JoyceM Yes

AFC DYAJim Ack.. methinks you need an amiga and a null modem cable or a
           modem.

AFA Gene   Methinks Jim is right

AFC DYAJim LOL!!  Design your music in the spreadsheet then import to NT :)
           IT might actually have better editing?!! :)

AFC Eddie  Right!

AFL JoyceM Me thinks he is right.  If I had them upload to me, would that
           work?

AFA Gene   Yep; should work like a charm.

AFC DYAJim Yah.. as long as they're coming from an amiga

AFL JoyceM Great....I will work on that when I get back  (making note now).

AFL JoyceM Gene, will you get some of those files (NT) sent to that area
           tonight?  If so, I will leave the needed message :)

AFA Gene   That's all I have planned for tonight's chat, Joyce. Yep, I'll
           move some files right now.

AFL JoyceM Thanks...

AFL JoyceM Then we should have our NoiseTracker Library by end of the week in
           AMS :)

ELECTMUSIC Gene... quick question:  Are you launching NTracker from a 3.5
           disk?

AFL JoyceM Okay, guys...I will see you all the week of December 11th (may the
           4th) as I am off on vacation.

AFA Gene   Yep greg

AFC JohnC  Where are you going?

ELECTMUSIC Do you encounter out of memory problems

AFL JoyceM Night all...and Gene, thanks for an excellent chat and great
           explanations of NoiseTracker.

Nuzz       Joyce, I have good news for FutureSound owners. SoundConvert will
           support it in the first release

AFC Eddie  Great, Mike!

AFA Gene   Greg, i always keep my RAMdisk at 0 when using noisetracker. Not
           only are

AFC JohnC  Mike...SoundConvert...released?

AFL JoyceM Great, Mike.  When can we get SoundConvert, Mike? and FutureSound
           :)

AFA Gene   there a couple of bugs with memory management, but if you're
           loading in a MOD file that's really big, NT will eat your RAMdisk.

AFC Eddie  Sounds good.

Nuzz       The manual is being "layout". Release date should be about 1st
           week of Dec

ELECTMUSIC Tnxs Gene

AFC JohnC  YES.......WTG Nuzz!!!!!!!!

Deanna7332 Yes, why is there on some MOD files a stop somewhere in the middle
           ?

Deanna7332 That's really frustrating!

AFL JoyceM Mike, leave me E-Mail on when and how I can send your the $$ to
           get it.

AFL JoyceM Again...night all

Nuzz       gee John, I had to do something to explain the delay :)

ELECTMUSIC Thanks Gene for a GREAT chat!

AFC Eddie  Yes, Gene!  Great!

AFA Gene   Thanks Greg, 'night!

    John Michael Osbourne, (known as "Ozzy" to his fans), has in his long 
career as vocalist for Black Sabbath had his work with the group misconstrued 
as advocating Satanism.  In a 1983 radio special featuring Ozzy, the 
interviewer expressed precisely this point; "...Ozzy has always been shrouded 
in the darkest of Satanic imagery.  Yet if you really listen to his music, 
you'll find that what he is saying differs greatly from his image...."(1)  Even 
the group's image has often been described as "occult and diabolic".(2)

    The important point to remember here is to differentiate between appearance 
and reality.  Although the name "Black Sabbath" conjures up images of witches 
and sorcerers paying homage to Satan for the powers bestowed upon them, this 
does not make it safe to assume that the group that went by this name 
necessarily drew the inspiration from the occult.(3)  The closest they ever 
came to it was a gothic horror film featuring Boris Karloff as narrator; they 
adopted their name directly from the name of this film.(4)  Black Sabbath was 
involved in the black arts as much as Karloff practiced casting spells off-
screen.  Tony Iommi, the group's guitarist, summed it up best when he described 
the group as having basically "...the same appeal as a horror movie.  It's all 
an act."(5)










    Just as their film counterpart did, Ozzy and Sabbath found the occult 
mythos to be an effective vehicle for powerful social commentary; particularly 
when put in the context of heavy-metal rock and roll.  Ozzy himself noted that 
there are "...people who pick up my [album] cover[s] and go...'This guy's got 
to be singing about Devil, doom, death and destruction.'  Which is not the 
case...."(6)

    The late Lester Bangs likened the group to Bob Dylan and William Burroughs, 
describing them all as "...moralists...trying to deal with a serious present 
situation in an honest way...."(7)  Ozzy and Black Sabbath merely bring to 
light the many evils of our world in their work, to try and make us realize 
that we are all victim to their influence.  They hope to make us recognize 
these evils so that we may take up arms against them; a point Ozzy emphatically 
stresses:  "...one thing everybody has got to understand about Black Sabbath's 
lyrics.  They're not downer lyrics, they're just telling everybody where it's 
at..."(8)  He also cites the group's most controversial tune, "Black Sabbath", 
as a response to the ignorant hippie culture still force when the tune was 
written in 1970:  "The hippies said: 'The world is beautiful man.' (sic)  You 
only had to look around you to see how crappy it was.  It was ridiculous 
listening to that stuff, let alone playing it, so we just wrote about the world 
the way it really was and how it affected us - and we felt better in ourselves 
because we were really being honest...."(9)

    I   1   HAVE YOU EVER THOUGH ABOUT YOUR SOUL-
        2   CAN IT BE SAVED?
        3   OR PERHAPS YOU THINK THAT WHEN YOU ARE DEAD
        4   YOU JUST STAY IN YOUR GRAVE.
        5   IS GOD JUST A THOUGHT WITHIN YOUR HEAD OR IS
        6   HE A PART OF YOU?
        7   IS CHRIST JUST A NAME THAT YOU READ IN A BOOK
        8   WHEN YOU WERE AT SCHOOL?

    II  9   WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT DEATH DO YOU LOSE
        10  YOUR BREATH OR DO YOU KEEP YOUR COOL?
        11  WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE THE POPE ON THE END
        12  OF A ROPE - DO YOU THINK HE'S A FOOL?
        13  WELL I'VE SEEN THE TRUTH - YES I'VE SEEN 
        14  THE LIGHT AND I'VE CHANGED MY WAYS.
        15  AND I'LL BE PREPARED WHEN YOU'RE LONELY 
        16  AND SCARED AT THE END OF OUR DAYS.

    III 17  COULD IT BE YOU'RE AFRAID OF WHAT YOU'R
        18  FRIENDS MIGHT SAY 
        19  IF THEY NEW YOU BELIEVED IN GOD ABOVE
        20  THEY SHOULD REALISE BEFORE THE CRITICISE
        21  THAT GOD IS THE ONLY WAY TO LOVE.

    IV  23  IS YOUR MIND SO SMALL THAT YOU HAVE TO FALL
        24 IN WITH THE PACK WHEREVER THEY RUN
        25  WILL YOU STILL SNEER WHEN DEATH IS NEAR
        26  AND SAY THEY MAY AS WELL WORSHIP THE SUN.

    V   27  I THINK IT WAS TRUE IT WAS PEOPLE LIKE YOU
        28  THAT CRUCIFIED CHRIST
        29  I THINK IT IS SAD THE OPINION YOU HADE WAS THE
        30  ONLY ONE VOICED.
        31  WILL YOU BE SO SURE WHEN YOUR DAY IS NEAR
        32  SAY YOU DON'T BELIEVE?
        33  YOU HAD THE CHANCE BUT YOU TURNED IT DOWN
        34  NOW YOU CAN'T RETRIEVE.










    VI  35  PERHAPS YOU'LL THINK BEFORE YOU SAY THAT
        36  GOD IS DEAD AND GONE
        37  OPEN YOUR EYES, JUST REALIZE THAT HE IS THE
        38  ONE.
        39  THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN SAVE YOU KNOW FROM
        40  ALL THIS SIN AND HATE.
        41  OR WILL YOU STILL JEER AT ALL YOU HEAR?
        42  YES!-I THINK IT'S TOO LATE.

    In this piece, the group asserts a belief in an afterlife and spiritual 
redemption.  As grisly as the image of a hanged pontiff is, its shock value is 
a necessary part of the message:  They reject religious dogma, stating that a 
belief in God, in one's own heart, is the only guiding light to help one inn 
his life (lines 11/12, 39/40).  Furthermore, the reject religious hypocrisy 
(lines 5/6, 7/8) and peer pressure (verses III, IV) as excuses for not 
accepting God.  To clarify further:  following the crowd does not justify 
shrugging responsibility for one's own actions.

    After re-reading, it becomes obvious that this song is an ascerbic critique 
of atheism; (line 35/36) I refer here again to verses three and four.  In these 
two verses, the picture painted in one of Godless conformity and how it's 
viewed as being as foolish as Paganism.  These lyrics set an example for the 
listener by relating personal experience (lines 13-16).  However, for those who 
cannot accept this the group has no recourse but to condemn them, although 
rather ironically; they hope that their rhetorical loss of faith in the 
listener will open his eyes (line 42).

            WHAT IS THIS, THAT STANDS BEFORE ME?
            FIGURE IN BLACK, WHICH POINTS AT ME
            TURN ROUND QUICK AND START TO RUN
            FIND OUT I'M THE CHOSEN ONE.  OH, NO!
            
            BIG BLACK SHAPE WITH EYES OF FIRE
            TELLING PEOPLE THEIR DESIRE
            SATAN'S SITTING THERE, HE'S SMILING
            WATCHES THOSE FLAMES GET HIGHER AND HIGHER
            OH, NO, NO, -- PLEASE GOD HELP ME!
            
                IS THIS THE END MY FRIEND?
                SATAN'S COMING 'ROUND THE BEND
                PEOPLE RUNNING 'CAUSE THEY'RE SCARED
                THE PEOPLE BETTER GO AND BEWARE
                NO, NO!  PLEASE--NO!!
                
                
    The all time controversy winner!  Is this not irrefutably  THE song about 
Black Magic in rock?  It's all so obvious, suffuse with evil imagery; Satan, 
walls of flame, figure in black, and damnation at the end.  Yes, I see the 
images too; it definitely concerns Black Magic.  Then again, Shakespeare's 
Macbeth employed scenes of witches involved in conjurations; does that mean 
that Shakespeare was a warlock?  Poe used to write sardonic tragedies about 
twisted murderers and the bizarre nature of acts, did that make him an evil, 
leering, demented killer?  Did either of them advocated what they wrote about?  
One has to remember that writing about something is not necessarily the same as 
emulating it.  Tony Iommi spoke out quite strongly about this:  "People are 
bringing us down saying that we are a Black Magic group.  I think they must be










getting mixed up with Black Widow.  We don't do any sacrifices on stage, and 
we're not on a black magic kick.  We wanted to do heavy numbers and the guitar 
riffs we worked out were more suited to evil things than love.  We play songs 
about black magic, but they are more likely to be against than for it."(12)  

    By now, you're probably asking yourself who Black Widow is, right?  Then 
it's time for a little history:

        Sabbath, before they were known as Sabbath, had the same line-up but 
two earlier names.  The first one was Polka Tulk, which seemed sure to doom 
them to obscurity.(13)  The soon realized this and changed the group's name to 
Earth.  Now, Earth was a blues band at the end of the English blues boom.  As 
if that wasn't bad enough, they soon discovered that not only was there another 
group named Earth, but they had also released a single.  To avoid confusion, 
they changed their name again.(14)  But what made them decide on that name?  
Just ask Ozzy:  "I just liked the name Black Sabbath because of the succession 
of vowel sounds.(15)  If that sounds ludicrous just consider this:  Sabbath was 
"...the first of the really committed, loud and heavy bands..."(16)  They 
needed a name to match the gut-wrenching power they were developing.  Tony knew 
that he wanted Sabbath to be noticed above all the rest of the British blues 
bands:  "We wanted something of our own that we'd like and people would like.  
And we wanted something loud!"










    Tony didn't hate the blues.  He'd cut his teeth as a guitarist on the likes 
of The Shadows, Buddy Holly and Django Rheinhardt, developing his own style 
from there.  But he realized the group had no future in the blues:

        'We couldn't keep playing 12-bars forever.  We just got fed up with 
Earth music.  It was jazz, blues stuff.  It was good for practice but nothing 
else.'

    In the late 'Sixties, blues groups were a dime a dozen in Birmingham and 
interest was waning in the blues boom due to the glut of groups.  One man, by 
the name of Jim Simpson, had heard Earth around the Birmingham club circuit and 
understood what they were trying to do.  He decided to take them under his 
wing.  With the aid of his massive record collection, Jim expanded the group's 
horizons in the areas of jazz and blues.  He introduced them to artists like 
Wes Montgomery, Count Basie and Jimmy Rushing.  It was from Rushing in 
particular that they derived the repetitive riff style so readily noticeable in 
their later incarnation as Black Sabbath.

    The Count Basie influence is evidenced in the song "Wicked World" from the 
first album; Sabbath drummer Bill Ward uses a "'sighing hi-hat'...in the manner 
of Basie's drummer Jo Jones."










    The influence is subtle, almost subliminal.  Yet it is one which was not 
thought capable of hard, 'heavy' rock bands in the late 'Sixties.  Although Led 
Zeppelin and Jimi Hendrix also had their work steeped in blues and jazz 
derivations (Hendrix' "Third Stone From the Sun" and Zeppelin's version of 
Willie Dixon's "I Can't Quit You Baby" from their first album), neither was 
able to match the intense energy of Black Sabbath.  Iommi has always had a 
preference for music with an original, distinct style of its' own; as an 
example, he mentions guitarists Joe Pass and Alvin Lee as two of his strongest 
songwriting influences.

    It would also be necessary that Sabbath develop a unique, distinctive style 
and image of their own.  Though they had changed their name from Earth to Black 
Sabbath to avoid confusion with the other Earth; at the same time another group 
emerged by the name of Black Widow "...who WERE profoundly influenced by the 
occult, had a male witch as a patron, and wrote pieces like "Come to The 
Sabbat."  Unfortunately, Sabbath was constantly reaping the benefits of Widow's 
publicity.

    Sabbath was a group that never minced words.  If they saw something as 
destructive, they would be sure to rub the listener's face it it.  They did not 
want their point to be missed.

    With their straightforward, sometimes brutal way of looking at things, they 
try to shock the listener's conscience back into awareness.  The imagery of 
"Hand of Doom", from the Paranoid album, is candid and condemning; it is a 
strong statement against drug addiction and rightly so...

            YOU DON'T WANNA LEARN
            PRICE OF LIFE YOU CRY
            NOW YOU'RE GONNA DIE
            
            
    Many people felt the group's overall direction was pessimistic and had a 
negative effect on its listener's due to that.  "Ozzy insisted that if people 
thought he was having a bad effect on the minds of young kids, they should go 
and watch the TV news where real murder and mayhem were a way of life, and 
shown night after night." (18)

    Sabbath was never negative in their message; they were simply truthful 
about waht they saw as wrong in the world.  If you "Strip away the horror 
stories, the imagery and the hysteria, (and) turn down the amps a notch...you 
have a well-rehearsed, solid blues and rock band, powered by a dedication to 
well defined objectives."  On the top of the list of those objectives was 
truth; Sabbath never feared facing that truth squarely, regardless of what many 
people thought of them.

Long, long, time ago,
I can still remember,
When the local calls were "free".
And I knew if I paid my bill,
And never wished them any ill,
That the phone company would let me be...

But Uncle Sam said he knew better,
Split 'em up, for all and ever!
We'll foster competition:
It's good capital-ism!

I can't remember if I cried,
When my phone bill first tripled in size.
But something touched me deep inside,
The day... Bell System... died.

And we were singing...

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
"Our local calls have us in hock!" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

Is your office Step by Step,
Or have you gotten some Crossbar yet?
Everybody used to ask...
Oh, is TSPS coming soon?
IDDD will be a boon!
And, I hope to get a Touch-Tone phone, real soon...

The color phones are really neat,
And direct dialing can't be beat!
My area code is "low":
The prestige way to go!

Oh, they just raised phone booths to a dime!
Well, I suppose it's about time.
I remember how the payphones chimed,
The day... Bell System... died.

And we were singing...

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
"Our local calls have us in hock!" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

Back then we were all at one rate,
Phone installs didn't cause debate,
About who'd put which wire where...
Installers came right out to you,
No "phone stores" with their ballyhoo,
And 411 was free, seemed very fair!

But FCC wanted it seems,
To let others skim long-distance creams,
No matter 'bout the locals,
They're mostly all just yokels!

And so one day it came to pass,
That the great Bell System did collapse,
In rubble now, we all do mass,
The day... Bell System... died.

So bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
"Our local calls have us in hock!" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

I drove on out to Murray Hill,
To see Bell Labs, some time to kill,
But the sign there said the Labs were gone.
I went back to my old CO,
Where I'd had my phone lines, years ago,
But it was empty, dark, and ever so forlorn...

No relays pulsed,
No data crooned,
No MF tones did play their tunes,
There wasn't a word spoken,
All carrier paths were broken...

And so that's how it all occurred,
Microwave horns just nests for birds,
Everything became so absurd,
The day... Bell System... died.

So bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
"Our local calls have us in hock!" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

We were singing:

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
"Our local calls have us in hock!" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
                             *                          

                   THE REAL OLD TIME RELIGION
                   tune: "Old Time Religion"

       (Chorus): Give me that real old time religion (3X)
                 It's good enough for me!

We will have a mighty orgy        We will sacrifice to Yuggoth
in the honour of Astarte          we will sacrifice to Yuggoth
it'll be a mighty party           Burn a candle for Yog-Soggoth
and it's good enough for me!      and the Goat With a Thousand Young!

We will all be saved by Mithras       If your rising sign is Aries
We will all be saved by Mithras       You'll be taken by the Fairies
slay the Bull and play the zithras    Meet the Buddah in Benares
on that Resurrection Day!             where he'll hit you with a pie!

I hear Valkyries a-comin                There are people into Voodoo
In the air their song is comin          there are people into Voodoo
They forgot the words! They're hummin!  I know I do, I hope you do!

              The savior of the human ra-aa-ace.
              She invented Imperium Compound,
              Most effacatious in evr'y case.

   There was Horic, We thought he was sick,

   This song'll bedevil the folks at a revel,

   Fredrick of Holland, who dwells in the Northland,

                                             IMPERIUM COMPOUND    
                                             (Atenveldt Verses)

   Now here's a story, a little bit gory,
   A little bit happy, a little bit sad.
   About a drink called Imperium Compound
   And how the SCA's been had!                       

   Chorus: Oh we think, we think, we think,
           The King is a fink, a fink, a fink,
           A figure of respectability
           Rules the Kingdom thru Imperium Compound
           The results are plain to see!

   Mongol Hordemen, those free-living swordsmen
   Subverting the Kingdoms from underneath!
   Have no use for Imperium Compound
   Except perhaps to brush their teeth!

   AltChorus: Oh we fink, we fink, we fink,
              The Khan and the Kink, the Kink, the Kink,
              And the Board, their Great Senilities!
              The Western Irgun, drinks Imperium Compound
              And we're BACK, with results you'll see!    

   Lady Laurel, with Authority Royal,
   Passes and rejects our heraldry
   She needs a swig of Imperium Compound
   Then perhaps she'd deign to talk to me!            

   Lady Trude thought it her duty
   To turn a social wrong into a Right
   Proved her point with Imperium Compound
   And showed that Cheshire Cats can fight!  //and scratch//

   The Board of Directors styled themselves The Electors
   And another con they tried to swing
   Now the BoD drinks Imperium Compound
   So we no longer need a King!                        

   AltChorus: Oh the Bod, the BoD, the BoD,
              It thinks it is God, is God, is God,
              The figure of Supreme Authority!
              And if we O.D.'d on Imperium Compund
              there'd be no need for Royalty!          

   Oh, MEDIEVAL Net, we thought it was all wet
   With witty remarks, and other kinds of sass
   We'll feed our computers on Imperium Compound
   And BYTE the BoD right on its' righteous ass!         

   Good old Duncan was often drunken
   Chasing all the ladies fair
   He bathed himself in Imperium Compound
   Now he has a little savoir faire!                     

                    (more)


  ATEN IMPERIUM (cont.)

   Ioseph of Locksley, never changes his socks, he
   Runs around looking like a Cavalier,
   He stocked up on Imperium Compound
   And he has enough to last for years and years!        

   AltChorus: Oh they forgot, forgot, forgot
              The Locks-e-ly Plot, the Plot, the Plot!
              And it works the best when it is underground!
              It isn't a hassle for a green-and-white tassle
              They're the ones that BREW Imperium Compound!  

   Trelon of the Wood, he was very good, he
   Was a leader that had never been beat before;
   But Caid had Imperium Compound,
   And Imperial Roman Caid won the War!  //with help!//   

   In Tyr Ysgithr, it's regularly whispered there
   That the Kingdom is ruled over by a King    // What's THAT? //
   They're "democratic" and quite erratic....
   They've forgot the purpose of the whole damn thing!     

   King Sir Mark von, with his pretty white suit on,
   Rules the Kingdom both with Grace and Purity!
   He never touches Imperium Compound
   At least not where anyone else can see!               

   Duke Sir Deaton, was never beaten
   On the field, or in the drinking hall;
   At the Catbox War with Caid,
   Left thirty bodies piled against the wall!             

   Denis O'Titans was good at smitin'
   A Locksley Monster in every single way!
   Drank a little Imperium Compound
   And ATE Deaton's sword that day  // No! REALLY! //

                          WTP-0002C

        Last night I had the strangest dream in this bleak century
        I dreamed that people the world around believed in Chivalry

        I dreamed I saw a Kingly Crown enshrined in laurel leaves
        with Grace and Joy and Purity attendant at his feet

        I dreamed I saw the perfect Knight receive his accolade
        and minstrels sang and children laughed in some soft forest glade

        I dreamed I saw the finest thing that ever man could make
        grow great and strong and undefiled: Pray God I never wake!

        Last night I had the strangest dream in this bleak century
        I dreamed that people the world around believed in Chivalry

               (to the tune of "Good King Wenceslaus")

                Locksley Monsters never yield
                on the field of battle
                strike the helm and bash the shield
                make their eyeteeth rattle
                Bodies on the ground will lie
                bones will burst in sunder
                search for Locksleys' enemies:

            There is a man who we know well that does the best he can
            but he's displayed in armour made of reticulated garbage cans!

            He looks so fine and fair and strong, oh how he plays the man
            and how it's prized, those galvanized, reticulated garbage cans

            The noblest Roman of them all, a good Praetorian
            a combatant who wears no pants, judst reticulated garbage cans!

            Like old Horatius at the Bridge, like the Legions of Valerian
            (O dearie me: those LOVELY knees!)
            and those reticulated garbage cans!

         (sung to the tune (obviously) of the 12 Days of Christmas)


1.           The first time I sent my device, The Heralds said to me

            "It violates the Rule of Three"

2.           The next time I tried it, the Heralds said to me

            "We changed the forms, and it violates the Rule of
             Three".

3.           The third time I tried, and the Heralds said to me, 

            "We upped the fees, we changed the forms, and it
             violates the Rule of Three".

4.           Another time I tried and the Heralds said to me,
 
            "We haven't got it, we upped the fees, we changed the 
             forms, and it violates the Rule of Three".

5.           The fifth time I tried it, the Heralds said to me,  

            "In a decision rendered by the College of Arms on
             August 1st, A.S. V it was decided that this style of
             heraldic design was not appropriate to the aims and 
             intentions of the Corporate Body. Holy! Holy! Holy! "

 note: verse 5 is delivered in an extremely fast, mono-
       tone, similiar to a Gregorian Chant.

           " ....we haven't got it, we upped the fees, we changed the forms,
             and it violates the Rule of Three."

6.           I tried it a sixth time, and the Heralds said to me,

            "We changed the rules, &c"

7.           A seventh time I tried and, the Heralds said to me,

            "It's against the Rule of Tincture, we changed the
             rules, &c"

8.           I tried it once again and the heralds said to me,

            "It's not a Period design, It's against the Rule of Tincture, We
             changed the rules, &c"

                                * more *



    Heralds Said To Me (cont.)

9.           I sent it in once more, and the Heralds said to me,

            "We changed the rules again, It's not a Period design,
             it's against the Rule of Tincture, we changed the
             rules, &c"

10. (sung in cold anger)
             The LAST time I sent my device, the Heralds said to me

    (sung in a state of SMUG)
             "Someone else has got it, &c"




              (nb: every single one of these reasons has been used by the
              CoA, at one point or another, to reject perfectly good
              heraldry, along with some even MORE stupid.  If the shoe 
              fits....................!!!!!!!!)

           or: Who was that Vermin I saw you with last, Knight?
   or: There may be Lice on all you Knice, but there ain't no Lice on me

           Once there was a Barony howling in the wilderness
           nestled in the Valley where the River doesn't flow
           and the folks were driven buggy by the insects in the Revel Hall
           Authenticity is wonderful, but this doesn't go!

                   Bugs on the Baroness, bugs on the Baroness!
                   That was the cry that you heard all the day
                   and the scratching can be heard from Ysgithr to Ered Sul
                   why did we come here? Let's go away!

           See them all a scratching, nestled in their armour tight
           the fleas have a melee team that's challenging the field!
           call Truly Nolen! Someone's gotta help us out!
           the crabs are nesting in our helms but we'll never yield!

                   (chorus)

           Dawn comes a-breaking, the bugs have won the Coronet...
           flea-infested Conan-clones in piles upon the lawn
           where is the Barony? The bugs have eaten everyone...
           termites got the stick-jocks, and all their sticks are gone!

                   (chorus)

                  For oft I thought of mighty men
                  who carved a Land with sword and pen
                  and lit a candle, burning bright,
                  that pierced the darkness; stirred the night!

                  So raise your banners, blazoned bright
                  Advance the Dream and Shine the Light!

      What the use of wearing panties
      whalebone corsets of your Auntie's
      boxer shorts and other scanties
      best of all is nude
      there's such fun in going bra-less
      now that it's no longer lawless
      'specially if your figure's flawless
      best of all is nude
      nude is what you're born in
      shirts are never torn in
      underwear and lacy flimsies, garter belts and other whimsies
      yards of itchy cloth to put your form in
      ducks all do it, maidens rue it
      even ancient Picts in Britain blue it
      going naked's how to do it
      best of all is nude!

      If your garters aren't elastic
      tie them up in knots fantastic
      (panty hose is something drastic!)
      best of all is nude!
      If you're tired of wearing clotheses
      shed your garment 'mongst the roses
      never mind the old bluenoses
      best of all is nude!
      Nude is best for ducking!
      Worst for horses bucking!
      Moonlit nights will see such sights
          that are very best for fooling round
                              .....and elbows!
      Nudity is grand to see
       a well-known antidote to virginity
      take your clothes off and you'll see:
      best of all is nude!

                   once I talked to a great Grey Man
                   spun three times and said with a sigh
                   hadn't been for the Runes had his other eye!

                   Hi said the Lady, dressed in green
                   prettiest thing I've ever seen
                   she went down underneath the hill
                   and came back out of her own free will

                   Brian Boru, on Irish ground
                   walked three times the Island round
                   Norsemen came lookin for a fight
                   just another Irish Saturday night!

                   Hi said Lugh on the banquest night
                   a poet and a player and a good wheelwright
                   a harper and a warrior and none the least:
                   a Druid and he got in to the Feast!

                   Harold Haardrada's face was red!
                   Came to Britain and he wound up dead

                   got six feet of English ground

                   the Legion with it's Eagles bright
                   marched into the Pictish night
                   met them there upon the sand
                   gave em up to the Wicker Man!

                   eight-legged steed and hound of Hel
                   the one-eyed Man, he loves ya well
                   fire burn and fire spark
                   are you then feared of the dark?

                   The Circle forms, the Circle flows
                   the Circle goes where no man knows
                   Hail to the Lady, one in three:
                   Present is Past and Past is Me!

                   Rhiannon's Birds are still in flight

                   sang the Day and sang the Night
                   sang the Land and sang the Sea
                   sang the Song, and then sang Me!

                                  came the Lady to the lea
                                  Sword and Roses in Her Hand
                                  spread their seeds thruout the Land

                                  saw the Lady where she stood
                                  by the fire burning bright
                                  came to know his heart's delight!

                   Present is Past and Past is WE

                   By Oak and Ash and Holy Thorn

                    WEAPONS AT THE DOOR

 Being a Polemic concerning the alleged Custom of the West Kingdom concerning 
 checking your Weapons at the Door of the Revel Hall. As the Satire is the 
 Weapon of the Bard, this said Polemic is to be checked at the Door, along with 
 swords, knives, redheaded Ladies and other such Deadly Things.....

         As I roved out to Western Lands to take the Western Air
         I went into a Revel Hall and I saw a Twelfth Night there
         but I was halted at the gate by a Privy Consellor
                 (that's the man who tells the King of the West how to go to
                  the bath room!)
         who told me I would have to check my Weapons at the door

         As I, in my astonishment, stood hung on tenter-pegs
         a Knight came in whose Prouess hung down between his legs
         the Doorman grabbed a greatsword and he struck the Knight full sore
         and gave him a reciept; he left his weapon at the door!

         a Bard was next whose goodly Voice has entertained us all
         but he, too, was prevented from entering the Hall
         and told he could not carry deadly weapons on the floor
         he left his Voice and Harp among the weapons at the door

         a Master entered graciously, a man we all know well
         who holds a 3rd Dan Black Belt, tho this he'd never tell
         the Master struggled valiantly, the Master cursed and swore
         but he left his hands, and feet, as weapons at the door

         the company was jovial, altho a bit dismayed
         for lack of proper cutlery, down to the smallest blade
         for even teeth and fingernails, each can be used in War
         were cut, and pulled, and left behind, as weapons at the door!

         And has their King not loyal Knights that He must be afraid
         of brawling in his Hall and of Assassin's bloody blade?
         the Rights of Men to carry Arms at least WE'VE not foreswore
         and a POX on them that made the Rule of Weapons at the Door!

                           THE STREETS OF ANN ARBOR

               As I walked out thru the streets of Ann Arbor
               as I walked out thru Ann Arbor one day
               I spied a young Mongol all dressed in white linen
               all dressed in white linen and cold as the clay

               I then spied another, done in on the sidewalk
               along with just about six dozen more
               their wounds were all gaping, from mace and from braoadsword
               from claymore and cannon, all dripping with gore

               what caused this grave carnage, I cried to the Monglos
               oh pray what's the reason for this awful sight
               my answer came slowly from under the corpse-pile
               "It seems that our bark is much worse than our bite....."

               the answer continued from pale lips a-shaking
               we sang all our songs and believed them as true
               the Dark Horde could never be beaten in battle
               we thought this was what all good Mongols could do...

               we went down to Atenveldt all for to plunder
               "too large to defend" was our song every night
               but Atenveldt's different from East, West or Middle
               there, even the bushes have learned how to bite!

               the Clann stole our ponies, the Scraelings our foodstuffs
               we ran into axes in AtenViking hands
               our maidens ran off with one Richard of Arkham
               and we're all that's left to return to our lands

               MacChluarains and Monsters, Lockehaven and Foxmoor
               that Kingdom is BIG and its' fighters are MEAN!
               we fought and we lost, and fled back to Ann Arbor
               we all came back home with results that you've seen

               keep away from that Land with its' cactus and marshes
               it's no place for Mongols who are bent on War
               they count their blows well, but they strick them yet better
               he crawled into his Yurt, and fell, dead, on the floor.....

                       SONG OF THE THREE
             copyright 1981 W. J. Bethancourt III
                            C. A. Bethancourt III
       tune: the song of the Cowardly Lion, Tin Woodsman and Scarecrow
             in the movie version of the Wizard of Oz

        (Enter the Scarecrow, who singeth:)

        My wife is always nagging; my Prowess it is lagging
        I can't do anything
        she has got a reason, but revenge is out of season
        Oh I wish I could be King!

        If I just had the Crown on, I'd always have a frown on
        and the Barons on a string
        Heads they would be rolling, the Board would be cajoling
        Oh if only I was King!

        I am very fed up with the way this group is set up
        Oh I'd change everything!
        they are so high and mighty with the way that they do fight-ey
        Oh, someday I'll be King!

        Tho my wife is melancholic, and very...vitriolic
        she's a wasp without a sting!
        I'd have to supervise her with a pack of tranquilizers
        If I only was a King......

        (the Tin Woodsman joineth him, and singeth:)

        I grew up kind of cocky, and rather big, and stocky
        and straight as any rod
        on the field I'm a battallion, with the Ladies I'm a stallion
        ...Oh they'd better make me God!

        The other boys are jealous they say I'm over-zealous
        they'd do better to applaud
        the things that I am giving to this Dream that we are living
        oh I wish they'd make me God!

        They say that I'm conceited, but I'm just badly treated
        by people and by BoD
        just think of what they're missing by My Majesty dismissing
        Oh they'd better make me God!

        (the Cowardly Lion creepeth forth, and singeth:)

        Oh I could be a fighter, a great and mighty smiter
        and be the perfect knight
        it's a great and nasty shame, and everyone's to blame
        oh I wish that I could fight!

        Song of the Three (cont.)

        I could be a Cavalier drinking wine and ale and beer
        and be a gorgeous sight
        but it would cost me too much money so it isn't very funny
        oh I wish that I could fight!                               

        Let me at 'em on the field, I would surely make them yield
        to my Power and my Might
        with rattan, shinai and rapier they would nevermore escape here
        If they'd only let me fight

        (all doeth the Softe Shoe off, stage left)

                She was afraid to come out to the Tourney
                She was worried that "something might show.."
                She was afraid to come out to the Tourney
                And the poor thing did NOT want to go...

                  (2 - 3 - 4, tell the people what she wore!)

                  It was an itsy bitsy teeny weenie little rabbit fur bikini

                One day in the Kingdom of the Middle
                It happened at a Tourney one day:
                The Mongols invaded the Middle
                But the Middle did not want to play...

                  (eins - zwei - drei, but the Dark Horde wouldn't die!)

                  It was an itsy bitsy tiny teenie Nauseating Mongol weenie

          Some folks call me many names, others call me crazy
          Tom O'Bedlam's son am I, for my mind is hazy!
          I'd rather sing a song than work (if it's not too phrasey!)
          Lengthy rhymes don't bother me....truth to tell: I'm lazy!

          Yang, your yurt is very nice, and your Horde is smelly,
          And I'm sure that yak-meat will nicely fill one's belly!
          But remember this one line, or you're not worth jelly:
          FIRST you plunder, THEN you burn! That's how to be rakehelly!

          My Lady Lorelei your eyes do drive me to distraction
          And the lovely Care-Cheri causes....petrifaction!
          But I, and they, quite taken are, so I can't take action...
          Therefore, Ladies, fill my cup; I'll drink to stupefaction!

          Now Atenveldt your fighters, all, are most good and gentle
          And the Ladies, bless 'em all, are most ornamental!
          But that little Nikki-Toad....has me sentimental
          Though with boffer in her hand she is argumental!

          This stupid little song, m'lords, is mostly sung in Latin
          By the Goliards, of course, from vespers clear to matins!
          But I prefer a coarser cloth over silk or satins
          English is more understood, mine enemies to flatten!

          Good People all, I've made my Song, its' music's well-recited
          But my voice could use some work; the flowers it has blighted!
          It's rude and rusty, grim and bad, and squeaky like a door-hinge,
          But I'm a better Bard than you: I found a rhyme for "orange!"

 resident in Caid. This verse was written when she was 2 years old. Ask HER!

                      by William Poundstone
                              1983

     Two mentalities are at work here: 1960s rock fans and 1980s
fundamentalist Christians. The idea of phonographically concealed
messages dates from the Paul McCartney death scare of 1969. For
hard-core types, the secret-message rumors never really died. Avid
rock fans have auditioned ever album release since the late 1960s
for hidden nuances. Backward messages, barely audible messages,
and messages on one stereo track only have been alleged. At the
other end of the sociosensual spectrum, fundamentalist Christians
have gotten into the act. TV programs such as PRAISE THE LORD and
THE 700 CLUB have propagated rumors of a satanic plot in the
recording industry, no less, in which various albums conceal
"backward-masked" demonic murmurings. If THAT sounds too spacey to
be taken seriously, consider that it was the fundamentalist groups
who were behind House Resolution 6363, a bill introduced in the
U.S. House of Representatives by Robert K. Dornan (R., Calif.) in
1982 to label all suspect records: "WARNING: THIS RECORD CONTAINS
BACKWARD MASKING THAT MAKES A VERBAL STATEMENT WHICH IS AUDIBLE
WHEN THIS RECORD IS PLAYED BACKWARD AND WHICH MAY BE PERCEPTIBLE
AT A SUBLIMINAL LEVEL WHEN THIS RECORD IS PLAYED FORWARD." In
February 1983, the Arkansas State Senate passed a similar record-
labeling bill by a vote of 86 to 0.
     Contributing to the quasi-occult status of these rumors is
the difficulty of checking them out on home audio equipment. You
pretty much have to take someone else's word for it, or dismiss
the rumors out of hand.
     From a technical standpoint, there are four simple ways to
conceal a verbal message on a recording. The most obvious is to
record the message at a very low volume. The message may then be
recovered by turning the volume up while playing the record or
tape. If the message is faint enough, though, noise levels of home
equipment may garble it. If the accompanying music or lyrics are
loud enough, or if the message itself is indistinct or
electronically modified, it may be hard to hear on any equipment.
     A second gimmick is to record a message on one stereo track
only. Records and tapes have two independent recordings, of
course, normally played simultaneously for stereo effect. On a
record, each stereo track occupies on one side of the V-shaped
groove for the needle. On a tape, the tracks are recorded in
parallel lanes of the magnetic material. The two tracks are called
"right" and "left" after the stereo speakers they will play on.
Otherwise, the tracks are interchangeable -- the sound mixer can
put anything he or she wants on each track. A message on one track
can be masked by simultaneous loud music or lyrics on the opposite
track. With normal stereo balance (or mono equipment) the loud
track drowns out the message track. At home, single-track messages
can be recovered by adjusting the stereo balance so that only the
desired track plays. Sometimes this trick also makes indistinct
words clearer. Even if the words are not exclusively on one track,
they may happen to be more audible on one track.
     A message could be recorded at a speed different from the
rest of the record. Then the record would have to be played faster
or slower than usual to recover the message. Unless the message
was at one of the standard speeds (say, 45 rpm on a 33 1/3 rpm
record), it could not be played normally on home equipment.
     The fourth and most commonly alleged trick is to record a
verbal message backward. Reversed speech has several unexpected
features. One is that syllables are not a constant in the reversal
process. A one-syllable word can have two or three syllables when
played backward. Thus "number nine" in the Beatles' REVOLUTION 9
reverses to "Turn me on, dead man" (or something like it), a jump
from three to five syllables.
     There is no simple way to predict what a word or phrase will
sound like reversed. Obviously, you can't just reverse the
letters.
     Reversed messages are difficult to recover at home. Record
turntables are not built to go backwards. Some have a neutral
setting, in which the pickup and amplifier remain active and you
can turn the record backward by hand. But hardly anyone has a
stead enough hand to produce satisfactory results.
     With patience, it is possible to reverse a cassette
recording. Transfer the music from the original record or tape
onto a blank tape cassette. Place the cassette flat on a table.
Draw our the part of the tape with the suspected message and snip
it off at both ends. Hold the tape segment horizontally. Rotate it
180 degrees, keep it horizontal at all times. This turns the tape
end for end. Splice the reversed tape segment back onto the two
loose ends of the cassette with strong adhesive tape. Reel the
tape back inside the cassette. The sliced segment will play
backward on an ordinary cassette player.
     I rented a recording studio to test the secret-message
rumors. New copiies of the records in question were transcribed on
a quarter-inch master tape. Where rumor alleged that a single
stereo track contained a message, right and left stereo tracks
were transcribed separately. Records with alleged inaudible
messages were treated similarly. To test claims of reversed
messages, recordings on the master tape were edited out and
spliced in backward. Twenty cuts or portions of cuts from sixteen
albums were tested.


"Another One Bites the Dust"
Queen, THE GAME

Rumor: When played backward, the lyrics say, "It's fun to smoke
marijuana."
Findings: There is something that sounds like "It's fun to smoke
marijuana" in the reversed music. It is repeated over and over. It
might be rendered no less faithfully, however, as "sfun to scout
mare wanna." This "message" is the reversal of the song title,
which is repeated as a line in the song.
     Let's make a distinction between engineered and phonetic
reversals. When an artist records a verbal statement, reverses it
by turning the tape end for end, mixes the reversed statement onto
a master tape, and has records and tapes produced from the master,
that is an engineered reversal. When the phonetic properties of
song lyrics are such that they can be reversed to sound like
something else, that is a phonetic reversal.
     "It's fun to smoke marijuna" is clearly a phonetic reversal.
The lyrics are perfectly plain played forward ("Another one bites
the dust"), no so plain played backward ("sfun to scout mare
wanna"). With an engineered reversal, the opposite should hold
true: gibberish forward, clear as a bell backward. Some are
prepared to believe that phonetic reversals are just as
intentional as engineered reversals -- that the songwriter
painstakinginly planned the phonetic double-entendre. In the
absence of confirming evidence, that just doesn't wash. It's too
easy to find coincidences. If, for example, the letters of the
alphabet are recited in conventional fashion (Ay, Bee, Cee, etc.)
and reversed, at least five sound like English language words. D
reverses to "eden," F becomes "pray," S becomes "say," V becomes
"even," and Z becomes "easy." "It's fun to smoke marijuana" is
likewise a coincidence.


"A Child is Coming"
Jefferson Starship, BLOWS AGAINST THE EMPIRE

Rumor: When played backward, "son of Satan."
Findings: Another phonetic coincidence. The repeated "It's getting
better" reverses to an iffy "son of Satan," the "of" drawn out and
the "Satan" strongly accented on the first syllable.


"Eldorado"
Electric Light Orchestra, ELDORADO

Rumor: When played backward, "He is the nasty one/ Christ, you're
infernal/ It is said we're dead men/ Everyone who has the mark
will live."
Findings: Coincidence. The supposed message lurks around the line
"On a voyage of no return to see." Reversed, this passage becomes
the expected syllable salad -- no one hearing it would describe it
as anything but reversed music. Only if you listen while reading
along with what you're supposed to hear will you get anything. The
rumored version of the message is somewhat fudged. The passage
sounds more like "He's to nasty one/ Christ you are, Christ,
you're fernal/ There wiss uh, we're dead men..." There is no "in"
in what is taken to be "infernal." The line that is supposed to be
"Everyone who has the mark will live" isn't even close, though the
syllable count is right.


"Shoo Be Doo"
The Cars, CANDY-O

Rumor: When played backward, the word "Satan" repeated
approximately eleven times.
Findings: Coincidence. The rumor refers to the reversal of the "Shoo
be doo, shoo be doo, shoo be doo..." near the end of the song. Given
the mysterious logic of reversed phonemes, these three-syllable units
can be hard as a repeated two-syllable word. The word sounds a little
like "Satan."


"Snowblind"
Styx, PARADISE THEATER

Rumor: According to a mimeographed list of suspect records distributed
by Congressman Dornan, the words "Satan move through our voices" when
played backwards.
Findings: Negative. Despite repeated listenings, it was not even
possible to identify the part of the reversed track that Dornan et al.
are talking about.


"Stairway to Heaven"
Led Zeppelin, untitled, a.k.a. STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN

Rumor: In reverse, "I live for Satan... The Lord turns me off...
There's no escaping it... Here's to my sweet Satan... There's power in
Satan... He will give you 666."
Findings: Coincidence. If you listen very carefully to the "And it
makes me wonder" lines in reverse, you'll hear something approaching
"There's no escaping it." A better description is "There's no escape
do." Knock of the last syllable, and you have "There's no escape," a
complete, intelligible sentence in reverse. It's there, all right, but
it's not an unlikely enough coincidence to -- well, make you wonder.
      The "Satan" in "I live for Satan" is good and clear. The "I live
for" part isn't. The other alleged lines are unremarkable. All are
phonetic reversals of the entirely lucid forward lyrics and obviously
just accidents.


"When Electricity Came to Arkansas"
Black Oak Arkansas, BLACK OAK ARKANSAS and RONCH AND ROLL

Rumor: In reverse, "Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan. He is God. He
is God."
Findings: The BLACK OAK ARKANSAS cut was reversed. Again, pairs of
reversed syllables are being freely interpreted as "Satan." "He is
God" was not identifiable.


"Rain"
The Beatles, HEY JUDE

Rumor: Unintelligible lyrics at the end are reversed.
Findings: A true engineered reversal and not really a secret. "Rain"
seems to have been the first popular recording to incorporate an
obviously reversed lyric. The story is that John Lennon accidentally
spliced the last part of the song in backward and liked the effect.
When reversed, the strange-sounding vocals at the end become
intelligible as a reprise starting with the drawn-out word
"sunshine."
      The reversal is less apparent to the casual listener than it
might be because the accompanying music is not reversed. The ending
fits in smoothly with the rest of the song, the vocals suggesting a
foreign language.


"Fire on High"
Electric Light Orchestra, FACE THE MUSIC

Rumor: When played backward, "The music is reversible, but time --
turn back!"
Findings: "Fire on High" is instrumental. About twenty-six seconds
into the music, scrambled speech is heard. It is mostly louder than
the accompanying music and begins with a two-syllable unit repeated
several times. The seeming speech lasts for about fourteen seconds.
      Reversing the music confirms that there is a true, engineered
message. In reverse, a voice (Jeff Lynne's?) says, "The music is
reversible, but time -- turn back! Turn back! Turn back! Turn back!"
All the words are clear and unambiguous. Anyone comparing this to the
alleged reversal on ELO's "Eldorado" will have no trouble telling
which is genuine.


"Goodbye Blue Sky"
Pink Floyd, THE WALL

Rumor: In reverse, "You have discovered the secret message."
Findings: The "secret message" is at the very end of the instrumental
passage following the "Goodbye Blue Sky" vocals. It comes just before
the words "What shall we do" at the start of the song that is
identified as "Empty Spaces" on the record label and as "What shall we
do now?" on the record sleeve. Played forward, the message is less
apparent than the FACE THE MUSIC reversal: A reasonably attentive
listener might play THE WALL through and not catch it. It suggests
speech not quite close enough to be overheard. In context this is not
unusual because the "Goodbye Blue Sky" instrumental passage includes
"airport noises" and other sound effects. A loud climax in the music
further masks the unintelligible voice.
      When played backward, the voice (Roger Waters?) plainly intones,
"Congratulations, you have just discovered the secret message. Please
send your answer to old Pink, care of the funny farm..." As the voice
fades out, there may be another word -- perhaps "Chalfonte or
"Chelsea" -- after "funny farm."


"Heavy Metal Poisoning"
Styx, KILROY WAS HERE

Rumor: A red sticker on the KILROY WAS HERE cover warns, "By order of
the Majority for Musical Morality, this album contains secret backward
messages..."
Findings: This is a case of second-generation backward-masking. Styx'
PARADISE THEATER did not contain a backward message, though a lot of
people said it did. So Styx has included a sure enough backward
message on KILROY WAS HERE. It is at the very beginning of "Heavy
Metal Poisoning." The reversed speech last about three seconds. There
is no musical background. The words reverse to "Annuit coeptis. Novus
ordo seclorum." This is the Latin motto encircling the pyramid on the
back of a dollar bill. The usual translation: "God has favored our
undertakings. A new order of the ages."
      The cover sticker's "Majority for Musical Morality" is a
fictitious Falwellesque group in the KILROY WAS HERE video. Although
the sticker suggests a plurality of "messages," only one was found.


Space between "I'm So Tired" and "Blackbird"
The Beatles, untitled, a.k.a. THE WHITE ALBUM

Rumor: A reversed message. At the time of the Paul-is-dead stories,
the segue from "I'm So Tired" to "Blackbird" was offered as evidence.
It was held to contain John Lennon's voice, reveresed, saying "Paul is
dead, miss him, miss him, miss him." That interpretation seems
unlikely now, but there is a mysterious low muttering between the
songs.
Findings: The mumbling is actually just to the "I'm So Tired" side of
the shiny "space" between cuts on the record. Each of the stereo
tracks was recorded separately, twice, and a copy of each track was
reversed. This produced four versions of the two-second passage: right
forward, left forward, right reversed, and left reversed. All were
equally unintelligible. It was not even apparent whether the voice is
forward or reversed. Nor could John Lennon be identified as the
speaker. There are nine or ten syllables. The first six (when played
forward) are a two-syllable unit repeated three times. There is little
or no difference betwen the stereo tracks. Any claimed interpretation
of the sounds seems doubtful.


"Strawberry Fields Forever"
The Beatles, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR

Rumor: It was, of course, claimed that John Lennon says "I buried
Paul" at the end. (It's forward, at the very end after the music
fades to complete silence, returns, and starts to fade out again.)
But Lennon told ROLLING STONE that the words are "cranberry
sauce."
Findings: They are "cranberry sauce." The "sauce"/"Paul" part is
indistinct, but the first syllable sounds a lot more like "cran"
than "I."


"Baby You're a Rich Man"
The Beatles, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR

Rumor: On one of the tracks the line "Baby you're a rich man too"
is sung as "Baby you're a rich fag Jew," a dig at Brian Epstein.
Or some think it's "rich fat Jew" and claim it as evidence of
Beatle anti-Semitism.
Findings: Negative. The two stereo tracks are nearly identical.
It's always possible to hear words as similar-sounding words, but
basically, the lyrics jibe with the published version.


"Revolution 9"
The Beatles, untitled, a.k.a. THE WHITE ALBUM

Rumor: Various reversed and/or one-track speech. The reversal of
"Number nine" to "Turn me on, dead man" has pretty much been
discounted as coincidence (though it appears on Congressman
Dornan's list).
Findings: Distinction between lyrics and any hidden message blurs
on "Revolution 9." The eight-minute cut is a montage of sounds
collected by John Lennon and Yoko Ono. It includes discordant
music, radio broadcasts, sirens, applause, gunfights, sports
cheers, the crackling of a fire, screams, a baby gurgling, a choir
singing, and much that cannot be identified. For this
investigation, "Revolution 9" was transcribed four times, twice on
each stereo channel. One copy of each of the tracks was reversed.
The four resulting versions were compared with each other and
against the original two-channel version.
     "Revolution 9" contains a lot of talking. Played in stereo,
forward, the longest stretch of understandable speech is probably
an announcer saying, "...every one of them knew that as time went
by they'd get a little bit older and a little bit slower..."
     One believable instance of reversed speech occurs: someone
saying "Let me out! Let me out!" (once held to represent McCartney
in his totaled Aston-Martin). Two iffy reversals occur on the
backward recording of the right stereo track:"She used to be
assistant" and "There were two men..." Neither is clear enough or
long enough to be convincing. Some of the music, including the
recurring theme, sounds more natural in reverse.
     "Turn me on, dead man" is a typical phonetic reversal. The
forward "number nine" (repeated throughout the cut) is clear; the
reversal is slurred -- something like "turn me on dedmun." It has
been claimed that "number nine" must be pronounced with a British
accent or with some careful inflection in order to reverse to
"Turn me on, dead man." This seems not to be so. As an experiment,
three American-accent renderings of "number nine" were reversed.
All sound about as much like "Turn me on, dead man" as the record
did. Like the other phonetic reversals, "Turn me on, dead man"
must be considered a coincidence.
     Much of "Revolution 9" is on one stereo track only. Near the
end a voice says "A fine natural imbalance...the Watusi...the
twist...Eldorado...Eldorado." "A fine natural imbalance" is on the
right track only, though the words that follow are in stereo. One
of the longer bits of speech -- "Who could tell what he was
saying? His voice was low and his [unintelligible] was high and
his eyes were low" -- is clear on the left track, a bare whisper
on the right.
     There is a stereophonically concealed "secret message" on
"Revolution 9." The words are on the right track. They begin about
four minutes, fifty-eight seconds into the cut and run for about
twenty-two seconds. They are not likely to be noticed in stereo
because of the much louder left track. The sound of applause
begins on the left track at about five minutes, one second into
the cut. Deafening noises -- the clapping, sirens, music --
continue on the left track until five minutes, forty seconds. It
may or may not have been Lennon's and Ono's intention to conceal
the spoken passage. Given the haphazard quality of "Revolution 9,"
the concealment may have been accidental. To recover the passage,
the left track must be switched off. The right track can then be
heard to contain a sound like a stopwatch ticking, behind these
words:

     So the wife called, and we better go to see a
     surgeon....[A SCREAM MUFFLES A LINE THAT SOUNDS LIKE
     Well, what with the prices, the prices have snowballed,
     no wonder it's closed.] ...So any and all, we went to
     see the dentist instead, who gave him a pair of teeth,
     which wasn't any good at all. So instead of that he
     joined the bloody navy and went to sea.
                      by William Poundstone
                              1986

     There really are backward messages on rock albums. And the
controversy over "backward masking" and "porn rock" has inspired a
whole new spate of messages. There may have been more genuine
backward messages in the past few years than ever before.
     The backward message controversy is usually traced to the
1960s and John Lennon's avant-garde sound mixing on such tracks as
"Revolution 9" on the Beatles' WHITE ALBUM. Lennon probably wasn't
trying to conceal a message so much as create an interesting
sound.
     The matter might have ended right there had it not been for
the Paul McCartney death rumor. College kids tried playing Beatles
records forward, backward, and at various speeds to find "clues"
to McCartney's fate. In the process they found snippets of speech
from Lennon's experiments. Even after McCartney was found safe and
sound in Scotland, some listeners continued to look for hidden
messages.
     Somehow, fundamentalist Christian groups became convinced
(ca. 1982) that the alleged messages were commercials for devil
worship. Not a single indisputable satanic message has turned up,
but there were scattered attempts to ban or label certain albums.
In 1986 one fundamentalist group announced that the theme song for
the old MR. ED TV show contains the word "Satan" when played
backward.)
     Ironically, the publicity accorded nonexistent messages has
inspired several artists -- among them porn rock hearing witness
Frank Zappa -- to hide real background messages in their music.
It's easy to do.
     The performer speaks or sings the message normally, then
reverses the tape, which is mixed into the soundtrack. This is all
accomplished simply enough at any recording studio.
     What's not so simple is playing it back. More home record,
cassette, and compact disk players won't play backward. You can
turn a record backward with a pencil eraser, but it's not good for
the needle or the turntable. The only way to reproduce the message
with full fidelity is to use a professional-quality reel-to-reel
tape player and splice the tape in backward.
     We used the facilities of KLOS radio in Los Angeles to
reverse some recent records containing true backward messages.


"Secret Messages"
Electric Light Orchestra, SECRET MESSAGES

ELO's ELDORADO album was among those alleged to contain satanic
backward masked messages. A patient listening to ELDORADO played
backward reveals no such messages. You hear only what you ought to
hear -- the reversed lyrics of the songs, which sound nothing like
the "messages" claimed to be there. In the wake of such
allegations, ELO did put an (innocuous) backward message on their
FACE THE MUSIC album. Perhaps they thought this would show how
silly the allegations were. Instead, the backward-masking people
seized on this as proof that the other "messages" were real. In
the latest volley, ELO has named an album after the controversy.
     In Britain (where the backward-masking issue is viewed as an
American eccentricity), the cover of SECRET MESSAGES has a mock
warning label to youth about the hidden label. Word of the albums'
impending release in the United States caused enough of a furor to
chill CBS Records into deleting the cover blurb.
     The reversed message is easy to find. It's at the beginning
of the first song, which is itself called "Secret Messages." You
can hear reversed speech when you play the record normally. A
voice intones "secret messages" -- forward -- in the middle of the
reversed speech, lest anyone dare be so unhip as to not know
what's going on.
     We transferred a new copy of SECRET MESSAGES to reel-to-reel
tapes and played it backward. The backward message goes: "WELCOME
TO THE BIG SHOW/ WELCOME TO THE BIG SHOW."
     That's it.


"Ya Hozna"
Frank Zappa, THEM OR US

"Ya Hozna," a six-minute composition on the first record of the
THEM OR US double album, is ENTIRELY backward. The albums' inner
cover, which includes lyrics for the other songs, says, "backwards
vocal -- you figure it out" of this cut. It credits Frank and Moon
Zappa, George Duke, and Napoleon Murphy Brock as vocalists.
     Played forward, "Ya Howza" sounds like a record played
backward -- reasonably so. The vocals are prominent and
unintelligible. Moon Zappa's voice is curiously recognizable, even
in reverse. It is hard to tell whether the music was recorded
forward or backward.
     When "Ya Howza" is played in reverse, you discover that the
music is virtually a palindrome -- it sounds about the same
forward and backward. The voices are all backward. In some cases
they have been modified electronically. Many of the words are
muffled. Even after repeated careful listening on both stereo
tracks, it is difficult to make out many of the lyrics. It doesn't
help that some of the words seem to be stream-of-consciousness
nonsense. Some of the unintelligible stuff sounds like opera.
     Starting at the beginning of the reversed tape -- the end of
the forward tape -- the clearer vocals go like this: "I am the
heaven, I am the water." This is in a hymnlike register. "You are
a lonely little girl./ But your mommy and your daddy hold you." A
singsong synthesizer voice.
     The most interesting part of the lyrics is an intermittently
orgasmic rap in Moon Zappa's Valley Girl voice. There are three
short monologues:

I'm like green!
I'm like squat!
I'm like soul!
Repeat, like soul!
I'm like pull, push,
Okay, like slow, slow.

You're never too old
Like slow, like slow, like slow
Okay, I like it.


All right, faster, faster,
Go, do it, do it twice,
Yeah, that feels good,
I'm looking great,
Yeah, fer shure!
Like, no way!


"No Anchovies, Please"
J. Geils Band, LOVE STINKS

"No Anchovies, Please" is a novelty song, really a narration with
sound effects, about a woman who is kidnapped after eating
anchovies. She is taken to a "foreign-speaking" country. The sound
effect of the foreign tongue seems reversed. When you do play it
in reverse, it becomes: "It doesn't take a genius to know the
difference between chicken shit and chicken salad."


"Darling Nikki"
Prince, PURPLE RAIN

"Darling Nikki," cited as porn rock before Congress, is about a
dominatrix in a hotel lobby masturbating with a magazine. In part,
the complaint was that the album cover (flowers, and Prince on a
motorcycle) wasn't explicit enough to warn kids of the suggestive
lyrics. Senator Paula Hawkins apparently was not aware of a
backward message hidden in "Darling Nikki." The last thirty-five
seconds of the song is gibberish. The music changes abruptly and
becomes a repeated glottal sound. Then a two-syllable sound is
repeated twice, something like "heaven, heaven." Unintelligible
speech follows. At the end is a sound reminiscent of rain or bacon
frying , and wind sounds.
     Played backward, the message becomes:

     Hello, how are you?
     I'm fine 'cause I know that the Lord is coming soon.
     Coming, coming soon.

     It is clearly Prince and the Revolution singing this. The
words are clear but the intonation is funny -- the linger on some
words. Perhaps this is to make the reversed message you hear
playing the record normally a little less conspicuous.
     This is a weird reversal of the supposed secret message
menace. Raunchy forward lyrics conceal a religious secret message.


"Judas Kiss"
Petra, MORE POWER TO YOU

Petra is an obscure group that sings religious songs to a rock
beat. As further proof that things have gone full circle, the
backward-masking controversy prompted Petra to include a wholesome
backward message on their MORE POWER TO YOU album. It is in the
transition between two songs, just before "Judas Kiss." Clearly
audible gibberish reverses to this (the husky voice a cross
between George Beverly Shea and Dee Snider): "What are you looking
for the Devil for, when you ought to be looking for the Lord?"

AFL JoyceM Welcome to the Apple II Music & Sound chat - our discussion will
           be on NoiseTracker - the new FTA music program for the GS.  AFA
           Gene will be our host this evening...Gene, the floor is yours :)

AFA Gene   Hi all... well first I'd like to point out, if y'all aren't aware
           yet, that a spanking new version of NoiseTracker has recently
           been released (9 days ago) and is now available in our New Files
           library. It is version 0.5. I haven't played around with it much
           yet, but it's supposed to fix a lot of the little bugs in 0.3
           (the first version we had online).  NoiseTracker also includes
           the ability to directly import "modules," a term used for a
           certain type of Amiga song file which has become popular among PC
           users using the SoundBlaster sound card.

           Now, via NT, these "MOD" files are accessible by the GS. We
           expect to see a lot of activity on this end as far as ports from
           the PC and Amiga go. Note that you should be able to go straight
           to the PC music forum and download any recently uploaded MOD
           songfiles (there was a bug in the first wide release of the PCAO
           software, however, so a bunch of files with dates between around
           March 1991 and September 1991 may not download properly. Note that
           to use these PC MOD files, you'll have to rename the downloaded
           file "MOD.xxxxxx" if you want it to show up automatically in NT's
           "open" dialog box. (On the PC, all MOD files are named
           "xxxxxxxx.MOD" instead.)   Also, if the files are packed with ZIP
           compression, you'll need a program from the Communications Forum
           called AGATE -- it's a terminal program that includes the ability
           to unpack ZIP files.

           Now, I guess the best thing to do would be to talk about our
           favorite songfiles... there have been a few complaints, in fact,
           that people were not being "descriptive" enough in their file
           descriptions for uploads in describing the songs.

AFC Eddie  ?

AFA Gene   GA ed

AFC Eddie  Once a MOD file is unpacked with Agate, is a file type change
           needed?

AFA Gene   Nope, since all that NT looks for is the "MOD." being the first
           four characters in the filename.

AFC Eddie  OK, Thanks!

Deanna7332 Question...

JonL7      Can you list some of the features of Noisetracker?

AFA Gene   (you don't even need that "MOD." if you want to type the name in
           directly.)

Deanna7332 Did any of these mod files have anything to do with FTA's "Module
           A"

AFA Gene   Sure Jon, right after we answer Deanna's question. Deanna, you
           mean "Modulae?"

Deanna7332 Yes, that's it.

AFA Gene   Modulae was a demo written by FTA last year. (i'll get to you in a
           sec Doors).  It used SoundSmith v0.95 for all it's music. There
           is no connection between MOD files and Modulae by FTA.

Deanna7332 Throughout the demo it said "Loading modules"

AFA Gene   Those "modules" are not the same as Amiga soundfile "modules" --
           you see, what Modulae really was was a "stringing together" of a
           bunch of neat little tiny demos that FTA had written. So they
           called each little demo a "module" and thus the entire demo as a
           whole, "Modulae" (fancy plural of module?)

Deanna7332 Ok I understand.  Thank you. :)

AFL JoyceM Latin, Gene :)

AFA Gene   The term "MODule" from the Amiga comes from the idea that all the
           stuff needed to play the songfile (all the instruments + the
           sequence file) are included into one file, the "module."

TheDoors1  Gene, I have tried to d/l some recent uploaded MODs in the PC
           music area and still the problem exists.

AFA Gene   As I understand it, the problem was fixed VERY recently (correct
           me on this Joyce) and files uploaded as recently as early
           November still might not work depending on the version of the
           PCAO software that the uploader used.

AFL JoyceM Actually, Gene...I was under the impression that it had been, but
           if Doors is still having a problem, then it must not be fixed.

AFA Gene   What date was the file you tried to d/l, Door?

TheDoors1  umm 11/17, around there

AFA Gene   hmmm.... well i can tell you one thing... if it didn't work, don't
           waste your time again later... the problem is in the Apple
           software's method of d/lling files, and there are no plans to
           upgrade the Apple AO software.

AFL JoyceM I will endeavor to get an answer to that PC downloading
           problem/question :)

ThomasK63  i have a quick question... what can you use to unpack amiga mod
           files? On the PC side, that is.

TheDoors1  Agate Thomas

ELECTMUSIC Doors... what happens on after downloading..

Deanna7332 If it's LZHed you can't unless you have an IBM or
           PC/Transporter.

AFA Gene   If GS-ShrinkIt doesn't have that ability, i don't think there
           exists any such utility on the GS.

TheDoors1  What do you mean Elect?

ELECTMUSIC After you download the file... where do you encounter a problem?

TheDoors1  ok, you know when you download the file and at some point in the
           download the file starts to appear on your screen.  That's when I
           cancel it.

ThomasK63  I am sure soething good can be made w/out resorting to Amiga
           files

AFC Eddie  Yes, Doors, I believe the problem is with the PC software it was
           UL'd with.

TheDoors1  yeah Eddie.

GNO Tim    Amiga MOD files are typically compressed using LHarc.  I've
           uncompressed several on my Unix machine at school.

ThomasK63  good time for someone to make a lharc unpacker...

AFC DYAJim someone might be ;)

GNO Tim    Several people are already

AFC Eddie  Can't wait, Jim!

AFA Gene   Jon, did you have a question?

JonL7      The features of Noisetracker :)

AFA Gene   Oh yes... okay, here goes, in a nutshell, from most important to
           least:


AFA Gene   *  ability to import MOD files

           *  ability to import Soundsmith files

           *  ProDOS 8 based

           *  virtually no editing abilities (not a feature but important to
           know)

AFC DYAJim :)

AFA Gene   *  forgot: and the most important feature of all, the ability to
           hold instrument files in regular system RAM instead of DOC RAM,
           allowing for instruments far beyond the regular 64K limit found
           in ALL other GS music programs.

ThomasK63  I'll buy that!

TheDoors1  I have another question...when you're ready.

AFA Gene   GA Doors

TheDoors1  ok..is it true that NoiseTracker will take in soundsmith files and
           play them more clearly

AFA Gene   Well, as far as "what you hear," yes there is a definite
           difference with some instruments. It does NOT play the sounds
           more "clearly," but it just plays them in a different way. What
           many people seem to like about this "different way" is that
           sustained instruments (i.e. instruments designed to be played
           in a loop to simulate a long held note) seem to work better (or
           perhaps simply the way they were originally intended to work).

TheDoors1  I see

Deanna7332 Which takes up more space - MOD or NT  w/soundfile ?

AFA Gene   Deanna, it depends a few things, such as how big the sequence is,
           how many instruments you have, etc. Once you have a lot of
           assorted files, it'll probably average out to be about the same
           give or take a hundred blocks on your HD. So it basically depends
           on whether you prefer to have your instruments separate or not.

Deanna7332 Does playing quality differ with either one ?

AFA Gene   Nope. It's exactly the same either way. Loading time is the same
           too.

AFC Eddie  Can NT save songs as MOD files?

AFA Gene   Nope. It has options for Open and Close module, but these are
           still inactive.

AFA Gene   If there are no more questions, I'd like to talk about which NT
           files out there are the "hottest," since this info could be
           useful to many users who are interested in downloading NT/MOD
           files.

           My personal favorite is "Lambada," which is supplied by FTA with
           the program but is available separately on America
           Online.Everything about this file is really impressive except
           perhaps the sound quality of the horn-ish melody instrument.

           What about y'all, what are your favorite NT files?

AFL JoyceM Gene, there is a classical song for NT, but can't remember the
           name, but it is good.

AFC Eddie  I like Dragnet!

ELECTMUSIC So do I Ed

TheDoors1  I like Seven something

Deanna7332 My most favorite of all mod files is Pleasure Principle

AFC Eddie  <--appreciate's Greg's taste!

AFL JoyceM :)

AFA Gene   Deanna, i assume you got that from a local board?

Deanna7332 I got it from the PC forum here.

TheDoors1  I saw it there also

Deanna7332 I think under "Pleasure"

AFA Gene   Would you be able to upload it here? If it's really that good, we
           ought to have it available directly in our oun NT lib here (BTW
           folks, we will be releasing a new NoiseTracker software library
           soon!)

AFC Eddie  What a Forum!!!

Deanna7332 That sounds great!

AFL JoyceM Gene, do you think it will be possible for synthLAB files to be
           converted to MOD files?

AFL JoyceM MOD files?

AFA Gene   I doubt it, Joyce. The formats are so diametrically opposed in
           their entire basis of their file formats that it wouldn't be
           worth the time for a programmer to develop such a convertor.

Deanna7332 Isn't it possible to move the mod file from the PC forum to our
           music library?

AFA Gene   But..... it might be worth the time for a MIDI File Format to MOD
           convertor, since these two formats are more widely accepted.

Nuzz       they have nothing better to do Gene

ELECTMUSIC Gene.. some interesting similarities with DTune and NTracker

AFA Gene   They lose the file, tho, Deanna. :)

AFL JoyceM In what way, Greg?

ELECTMUSIC Both Prodos 8

Deanna7332 Shhh they won't know a thing :)

ELECTMUSIC I also believe Bill uses a shuttling of sound data between Doc
           Ram and Ram.

AFC Eddie  Interesting, Greg.

ELECTMUSIC Thats how he gets some of the excellent instrument quality

AFC Eddie  But Diversitune has that one distinction:  MIDI input.

AFL JoyceM Deanna, we would greatly appreciate it if you would upload that
           'Pleasure' song to our library :)

ELECTMUSIC Agreed Ed.. one of the factors FTA doesn't like to incorporate
           into their programs.

Deanna7332 I'll u/l it tonight if possible.

AFL JoyceM Thanks :)

AFC Eddie  Thanks, Deanna!

AFL JoyceM I will send Bill B a copy of NoiseTracker + some MOD files...to
           see what comments we get from him (will send when I get back).

AFC DYAJim What ever happened to that diversitune upgrade that was talked
           about ?

ELECTMUSIC That would be interesting Joyce

AFC Eddie  Bill apparently still working on it, Jim.

ELECTMUSIC I am sure he would appreciate the Prodos 8

AFC DYAJim good..

AFL JoyceM Jim...RSN....he was hoping by Christmas (this year), but he is
           soooo busy with his job, who knows?

AFC DYAJim Oh yeah, I noticed the speed calcuation in NT .5 is inaccurate
           :)

AFC DYAJim I recall he has set a lot of Christmas projected dates :)

ELECTMUSIC He was one of the first "Free Tools" experts in breaking all the
           rules for economic sake.

AFC DYAJim like for the vaporware DT inst editor like 2 years ago.

Deanna7332 Are there any Christmas Mod or NT songs?

AFC Eddie  Oh yeah, Diversi-Editor!

AFL JoyceM I know, Jim - but that I know he has been working on.

AFC DYAJim he projected Christmas for it, and it never came :)

AFA Gene   Not yet in AMS, but hopefully the Holiday Contest will change all
           that. :)

AFC DYAJim I look foreward to any upgrades..

AFL JoyceM Not that I am aware of Deanna - you have some?  hint, hint

Deanna7332 Nope sorry.  I was hoping there were some that could be u/led
           here

AFC DYAJim I'll be breaking out the xmas tune book rsn.. I should be able to
           midi a few :) (which rules out nt)

AFL JoyceM Question...

AFC Eddie  It would be more appropriate to have a converter from Appleworks
           spreadsheet to MOD than from MIDI!

AFL JoyceM If I got ahold of an Amiga song (MOD) disk...how would I convert
           them for here?

AFA Gene   You mean an Amiga-formatted disk?

AFL JoyceM Yes

AFC DYAJim Ack.. methinks you need an amiga and a null modem cable or a
           modem.

AFA Gene   Methinks Jim is right

AFC DYAJim LOL!!  Design your music in the spreadsheet then import to NT :)
           IT might actually have better editing?!! :)

AFC Eddie  Right!

AFL JoyceM Me thinks he is right.  If I had them upload to me, would that
           work?

AFA Gene   Yep; should work like a charm.

AFC DYAJim Yah.. as long as they're coming from an amiga

AFL JoyceM Great....I will work on that when I get back  (making note now).

AFL JoyceM Gene, will you get some of those files (NT) sent to that area
           tonight?  If so, I will leave the needed message :)

AFA Gene   That's all I have planned for tonight's chat, Joyce. Yep, I'll
           move some files right now.

AFL JoyceM Thanks...

AFL JoyceM Then we should have our NoiseTracker Library by end of the week in
           AMS :)

ELECTMUSIC Gene... quick question:  Are you launching NTracker from a 3.5
           disk?

AFL JoyceM Okay, guys...I will see you all the week of December 11th (may the
           4th) as I am off on vacation.

AFA Gene   Yep greg

AFC JohnC  Where are you going?

ELECTMUSIC Do you encounter out of memory problems

AFL JoyceM Night all...and Gene, thanks for an excellent chat and great
           explanations of NoiseTracker.

Nuzz       Joyce, I have good news for FutureSound owners. SoundConvert will
           support it in the first release

AFC Eddie  Great, Mike!

AFA Gene   Greg, i always keep my RAMdisk at 0 when using noisetracker. Not
           only are

AFC JohnC  Mike...SoundConvert...released?

AFL JoyceM Great, Mike.  When can we get SoundConvert, Mike? and FutureSound
           :)

AFA Gene   there a couple of bugs with memory management, but if you're
           loading in a MOD file that's really big, NT will eat your RAMdisk.

AFC Eddie  Sounds good.

Nuzz       The manual is being "layout". Release date should be about 1st
           week of Dec

ELECTMUSIC Tnxs Gene

AFC JohnC  YES.......WTG Nuzz!!!!!!!!

Deanna7332 Yes, why is there on some MOD files a stop somewhere in the middle
           ?

Deanna7332 That's really frustrating!

AFL JoyceM Mike, leave me E-Mail on when and how I can send your the $$ to
           get it.

AFL JoyceM Again...night all

Nuzz       gee John, I had to do something to explain the delay :)

ELECTMUSIC Thanks Gene for a GREAT chat!

AFC Eddie  Yes, Gene!  Great!

AFA Gene   Thanks Greg, 'night!

AFA Gene   thanx, see y'all later :)

Copyright 1987 Bob Szekely.

    John Michael Osbourne, (known as "Ozzy" to his fans), has in his long 
career as vocalist for Black Sabbath had his work with the group misconstrued 
as advocating Satanism.  In a 1983 radio special featuring Ozzy, the 
interviewer expressed precisely this point; "...Ozzy has always been shrouded 
in the darkest of Satanic imagery.  Yet if you really listen to his music, 
you'll find that what he is saying differs greatly from his image...."(1)  Even 
the group's image has often been described as "occult and diabolic".(2)

    The important point to remember here is to differentiate between appearance 
and reality.  Although the name "Black Sabbath" conjures up images of witches 
and sorcerers paying homage to Satan for the powers bestowed upon them, this 
does not make it safe to assume that the group that went by this name 
necessarily drew the inspiration from the occult.(3)  The closest they ever 
came to it was a gothic horror film featuring Boris Karloff as narrator; they 
adopted their name directly from the name of this film.(4)  Black Sabbath was 
involved in the black arts as much as Karloff practiced casting spells off-
screen.  Tony Iommi, the group's guitarist, summed it up best when he described 
the group as having basically "...the same appeal as a horror movie.  It's all 
an act."(5)










    Just as their film counterpart did, Ozzy and Sabbath found the occult 
mythos to be an effective vehicle for powerful social commentary; particularly 
when put in the context of heavy-metal rock and roll.  Ozzy himself noted that 
there are "...people who pick up my [album] cover[s] and go...'This guy's got 
to be singing about Devil, doom, death and destruction.'  Which is not the 
case...."(6)

    The late Lester Bangs likened the group to Bob Dylan and William Burroughs, 
describing them all as "...moralists...trying to deal with a serious present 
situation in an honest way...."(7)  Ozzy and Black Sabbath merely bring to 
light the many evils of our world in their work, to try and make us realize 
that we are all victim to their influence.  They hope to make us recognize 
these evils so that we may take up arms against them; a point Ozzy emphatically 
stresses:  "...one thing everybody has got to understand about Black Sabbath's 
lyrics.  They're not downer lyrics, they're just telling everybody where it's 
at..."(8)  He also cites the group's most controversial tune, "Black Sabbath", 
as a response to the ignorant hippie culture still force when the tune was 
written in 1970:  "The hippies said: 'The world is beautiful man.' (sic)  You 
only had to look around you to see how crappy it was.  It was ridiculous 
listening to that stuff, let alone playing it, so we just wrote about the world 
the way it really was and how it affected us - and we felt better in ourselves 
because we were really being honest...."(9)

    I   1   HAVE YOU EVER THOUGH ABOUT YOUR SOUL-
        2   CAN IT BE SAVED?
        3   OR PERHAPS YOU THINK THAT WHEN YOU ARE DEAD
        4   YOU JUST STAY IN YOUR GRAVE.
        5   IS GOD JUST A THOUGHT WITHIN YOUR HEAD OR IS
        6   HE A PART OF YOU?
        7   IS CHRIST JUST A NAME THAT YOU READ IN A BOOK
        8   WHEN YOU WERE AT SCHOOL?

    II  9   WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT DEATH DO YOU LOSE
        10  YOUR BREATH OR DO YOU KEEP YOUR COOL?
        11  WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE THE POPE ON THE END
        12  OF A ROPE - DO YOU THINK HE'S A FOOL?
        13  WELL I'VE SEEN THE TRUTH - YES I'VE SEEN 
        14  THE LIGHT AND I'VE CHANGED MY WAYS.
        15  AND I'LL BE PREPARED WHEN YOU'RE LONELY 
        16  AND SCARED AT THE END OF OUR DAYS.

    III 17  COULD IT BE YOU'RE AFRAID OF WHAT YOU'R
        18  FRIENDS MIGHT SAY 
        19  IF THEY NEW YOU BELIEVED IN GOD ABOVE
        20  THEY SHOULD REALISE BEFORE THE CRITICISE
        21  THAT GOD IS THE ONLY WAY TO LOVE.

    IV  23  IS YOUR MIND SO SMALL THAT YOU HAVE TO FALL
        24 IN WITH THE PACK WHEREVER THEY RUN
        25  WILL YOU STILL SNEER WHEN DEATH IS NEAR
        26  AND SAY THEY MAY AS WELL WORSHIP THE SUN.

    V   27  I THINK IT WAS TRUE IT WAS PEOPLE LIKE YOU
        28  THAT CRUCIFIED CHRIST
        29  I THINK IT IS SAD THE OPINION YOU HADE WAS THE
        30  ONLY ONE VOICED.
        31  WILL YOU BE SO SURE WHEN YOUR DAY IS NEAR
        32  SAY YOU DON'T BELIEVE?
        33  YOU HAD THE CHANCE BUT YOU TURNED IT DOWN
        34  NOW YOU CAN'T RETRIEVE.










    VI  35  PERHAPS YOU'LL THINK BEFORE YOU SAY THAT
        36  GOD IS DEAD AND GONE
        37  OPEN YOUR EYES, JUST REALIZE THAT HE IS THE
        38  ONE.
        39  THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN SAVE YOU KNOW FROM
        40  ALL THIS SIN AND HATE.
        41  OR WILL YOU STILL JEER AT ALL YOU HEAR?
        42  YES!-I THINK IT'S TOO LATE.

    In this piece, the group asserts a belief in an afterlife and spiritual 
redemption.  As grisly as the image of a hanged pontiff is, its shock value is 
a necessary part of the message:  They reject religious dogma, stating that a 
belief in God, in one's own heart, is the only guiding light to help one inn 
his life (lines 11/12, 39/40).  Furthermore, the reject religious hypocrisy 
(lines 5/6, 7/8) and peer pressure (verses III, IV) as excuses for not 
accepting God.  To clarify further:  following the crowd does not justify 
shrugging responsibility for one's own actions.

    After re-reading, it becomes obvious that this song is an ascerbic critique 
of atheism; (line 35/36) I refer here again to verses three and four.  In these 
two verses, the picture painted in one of Godless conformity and how it's 
viewed as being as foolish as Paganism.  These lyrics set an example for the 
listener by relating personal experience (lines 13-16).  However, for those who 
cannot accept this the group has no recourse but to condemn them, although 
rather ironically; they hope that their rhetorical loss of faith in the 
listener will open his eyes (line 42).










                           B L A C K   S A B B A T H 



            WHAT IS THIS, THAT STANDS BEFORE ME?
            FIGURE IN BLACK, WHICH POINTS AT ME
            TURN ROUND QUICK AND START TO RUN
            FIND OUT I'M THE CHOSEN ONE.  OH, NO!
            
            BIG BLACK SHAPE WITH EYES OF FIRE
            TELLING PEOPLE THEIR DESIRE
            SATAN'S SITTING THERE, HE'S SMILING
            WATCHES THOSE FLAMES GET HIGHER AND HIGHER
            OH, NO, NO, -- PLEASE GOD HELP ME!
            
                IS THIS THE END MY FRIEND?
                SATAN'S COMING 'ROUND THE BEND
                PEOPLE RUNNING 'CAUSE THEY'RE SCARED
                THE PEOPLE BETTER GO AND BEWARE
                NO, NO!  PLEASE--NO!!
                
                
    The all time controversy winner!  Is this not irrefutably  THE song about 
Black Magic in rock?  It's all so obvious, suffuse with evil imagery; Satan, 
walls of flame, figure in black, and damnation at the end.  Yes, I see the 
images too; it definitely concerns Black Magic.  Then again, Shakespeare's 
Macbeth employed scenes of witches involved in conjurations; does that mean 
that Shakespeare was a warlock?  Poe used to write sardonic tragedies about 
twisted murderers and the bizarre nature of acts, did that make him an evil, 
leering, demented killer?  Did either of them advocated what they wrote about?  
One has to remember that writing about something is not necessarily the same as 
emulating it.  Tony Iommi spoke out quite strongly about this:  "People are 
bringing us down saying that we are a Black Magic group.  I think they must be










getting mixed up with Black Widow.  We don't do any sacrifices on stage, and 
we're not on a black magic kick.  We wanted to do heavy numbers and the guitar 
riffs we worked out were more suited to evil things than love.  We play songs 
about black magic, but they are more likely to be against than for it."(12)  

    By now, you're probably asking yourself who Black Widow is, right?  Then 
it's time for a little history:

        Sabbath, before they were known as Sabbath, had the same line-up but 
two earlier names.  The first one was Polka Tulk, which seemed sure to doom 
them to obscurity.(13)  The soon realized this and changed the group's name to 
Earth.  Now, Earth was a blues band at the end of the English blues boom.  As 
if that wasn't bad enough, they soon discovered that not only was there another 
group named Earth, but they had also released a single.  To avoid confusion, 
they changed their name again.(14)  But what made them decide on that name?  
Just ask Ozzy:  "I just liked the name Black Sabbath because of the succession 
of vowel sounds.(15)  If that sounds ludicrous just consider this:  Sabbath was 
"...the first of the really committed, loud and heavy bands..."(16)  They 
needed a name to match the gut-wrenching power they were developing.  Tony knew 
that he wanted Sabbath to be noticed above all the rest of the British blues 
bands:  "We wanted something of our own that we'd like and people would like.  
And we wanted something loud!"










    Tony didn't hate the blues.  He'd cut his teeth as a guitarist on the likes 
of The Shadows, Buddy Holly and Django Rheinhardt, developing his own style 
from there.  But he realized the group had no future in the blues:

        'We couldn't keep playing 12-bars forever.  We just got fed up with 
Earth music.  It was jazz, blues stuff.  It was good for practice but nothing 
else.'

    In the late 'Sixties, blues groups were a dime a dozen in Birmingham and 
interest was waning in the blues boom due to the glut of groups.  One man, by 
the name of Jim Simpson, had heard Earth around the Birmingham club circuit and 
understood what they were trying to do.  He decided to take them under his 
wing.  With the aid of his massive record collection, Jim expanded the group's 
horizons in the areas of jazz and blues.  He introduced them to artists like 
Wes Montgomery, Count Basie and Jimmy Rushing.  It was from Rushing in 
particular that they derived the repetitive riff style so readily noticeable in 
their later incarnation as Black Sabbath.

    The Count Basie influence is evidenced in the song "Wicked World" from the 
first album; Sabbath drummer Bill Ward uses a "'sighing hi-hat'...in the manner 
of Basie's drummer Jo Jones."










    The influence is subtle, almost subliminal.  Yet it is one which was not 
thought capable of hard, 'heavy' rock bands in the late 'Sixties.  Although Led 
Zeppelin and Jimi Hendrix also had their work steeped in blues and jazz 
derivations (Hendrix' "Third Stone From the Sun" and Zeppelin's version of 
Willie Dixon's "I Can't Quit You Baby" from their first album), neither was 
able to match the intense energy of Black Sabbath.  Iommi has always had a 
preference for music with an original, distinct style of its' own; as an 
example, he mentions guitarists Joe Pass and Alvin Lee as two of his strongest 
songwriting influences.

    It would also be necessary that Sabbath develop a unique, distinctive style 
and image of their own.  Though they had changed their name from Earth to Black 
Sabbath to avoid confusion with the other Earth; at the same time another group 
emerged by the name of Black Widow "...who WERE profoundly influenced by the 
occult, had a male witch as a patron, and wrote pieces like "Come to The 
Sabbat."  Unfortunately, Sabbath was constantly reaping the benefits of Widow's 
publicity.

    Sabbath was a group that never minced words.  If they saw something as 
destructive, they would be sure to rub the listener's face it it.  They did not 
want their point to be missed.

    With their straightforward, sometimes brutal way of looking at things, they 
try to shock the listener's conscience back into awareness.  The imagery of 
"Hand of Doom", from the Paranoid album, is candid and condemning; it is a 
strong statement against drug addiction and rightly so...

    Many people felt the group's overall direction was pessimistic and had a 
negative effect on its listener's due to that.  "Ozzy insisted that if people 
thought he was having a bad effect on the minds of young kids, they should go 
and watch the TV news where real murder and mayhem were a way of life, and 
shown night after night." (18)

    Sabbath was never negative in their message; they were simply truthful 
about waht they saw as wrong in the world.  If you "Strip away the horror 
stories, the imagery and the hysteria, (and) turn down the amps a notch...you 
have a well-rehearsed, solid blues and rock band, powered by a dedication to 
well defined objectives."  On the top of the list of those objectives was 
truth; Sabbath never feared facing that truth squarely, regardless of what many 
people thought of them.

                          "Raw Data for Raw Nerves"
X-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-X
Long, long, time ago,
I can still remember,
When the local calls were "free".
And I knew if I paid my bill,
And never wished them any ill,
That the phone company would let me be...

But Uncle Sam said he knew better,
Split 'em up, for all and ever!
We'll foster competition:
It's good capital-ism!

I can't remember if I cried,
When my phone bill first tripled in size.
But something touched me deep inside,
The day... Bell System... died.

And we were singing...

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
"Our local calls have us in hock!" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

Is your office Step by Step,
Or have you gotten some Crossbar yet?
Everybody used to ask...
Oh, is TSPS coming soon?
IDDD will be a boon!
And, I hope to get a Touch-Tone phone, real soon...

The color phones are really neat,
And direct dialing can't be beat!
My area code is "low":
The prestige way to go!

Oh, they just raised phone booths to a dime!
Well, I suppose it's about time.
I remember how the payphones chimed,
The day... Bell System... died.

And we were singing...

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
"Our local calls have us in hock!" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

Back then we were all at one rate,
Phone installs didn't cause debate,
About who'd put which wire where...
Installers came right out to you,
No "phone stores" with their ballyhoo,
And 411 was free, seemed very fair!

But FCC wanted it seems,
To let others skim long-distance creams,
No matter 'bout the locals,
They're mostly all just yokels!

And so one day it came to pass,
That the great Bell System did collapse,
In rubble now, we all do mass,
The day... Bell System... died.

So bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
"Our local calls have us in hock!" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

I drove on out to Murray Hill,
To see Bell Labs, some time to kill,
But the sign there said the Labs were gone.
I went back to my old CO,
Where I'd had my phone lines, years ago,
But it was empty, dark, and ever so forlorn...

No relays pulsed,
No data crooned,
No MF tones did play their tunes,
There wasn't a word spoken,
All carrier paths were broken...

And so that's how it all occurred,
Microwave horns just nests for birds,
Everything became so absurd,
The day... Bell System... died.

So bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
"Our local calls have us in hock!" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

We were singing:

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
"Our local calls have us in hock!" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?

I hear Valkyries a-comin                There are people into Voodoo
In the air their song is comin          there are people into Voodoo

With bold Gilgamesh the Brave!      but that's good enough for me!

We will all see Aphrodite               We will all sing Hare Krishna
Though she's pretty wild and flighty    We will all sing Hare Krishna
She will meet us in her nightie         It's not mentioned in the Mishna

It was good enough for Loki         We will all go to Nirvana

Here's to those who copy Conan    There will be a lot of lovin

They're just Followers of Onan    Quit yer pushin and yer shovin
and that's good enough for me!    So there's room enough for me!

We will have a mighty Party           It was good enough for Sappho
In the honor of Astarte               With her lady on her lap-o
Grab your chiton - don't be tardy     She put Lesbos on the map-o
'Cause she's good enough for me!      With her pagan poetry!

Shall we sing a verse for Venus,    Well the Christians all are humming
Of the Gods she is the meanest,     Cause they say their God is coming,
Cause she bit me on my...elbow      Our God came three times this evening
And it's good enough for me.        And that's good enough for me.

   Now here's a story, a little bit gory,
   A little bit happy, a little bit sad.
   About a drink called Imperium Compound
   And how the SCA's been had!                       

   Chorus: Oh we think, we think, we think,
           The King is a fink, a fink, a fink,
           A figure of respectability
           Rules the Kingdom thru Imperium Compound
           The results are plain to see!

   Mongol Hordemen, those free-living swordsmen
   Subverting the Kingdoms from underneath!
   Have no use for Imperium Compound
   Except perhaps to brush their teeth!

   AltChorus: Oh we fink, we fink, we fink,
              The Khan and the Kink, the Kink, the Kink,
              And the Board, their Great Senilities!
              The Western Irgun, drinks Imperium Compound
              And we're BACK, with results you'll see!    

   Lady Laurel, with Authority Royal,
   Passes and rejects our heraldry
   She needs a swig of Imperium Compound
   Then perhaps she'd deign to talk to me!            

   Lady Trude thought it her duty
   To turn a social wrong into a Right
   Proved her point with Imperium Compound
   And showed that Cheshire Cats can fight!  //and scratch//

   The Board of Directors styled themselves The Electors
   And another con they tried to swing
   Now the BoD drinks Imperium Compound
   So we no longer need a King!                        

   AltChorus: Oh the Bod, the BoD, the BoD,
              It thinks it is God, is God, is God,
              The figure of Supreme Authority!
              And if we O.D.'d on Imperium Compund
              there'd be no need for Royalty!          

   Oh, MEDIEVAL Net, we thought it was all wet
   With witty remarks, and other kinds of sass
   We'll feed our computers on Imperium Compound
   And BYTE the BoD right on its' righteous ass!         

   Good old Duncan was often drunken
   Chasing all the ladies fair
   He bathed himself in Imperium Compound
   Now he has a little savoir faire!

   All the Crusadenes were big, but not mean,
   And the finest fighters in the town.
   But they all drank Jerusalem Compound,
   Winning Crown after Crown after Crown!                 

   Good Duke Arthur couldn't get no farth-er
   A Norman King in Aten Land
   Drank too much of Imperium Compound
   And went off to conquer Engel-land!                    

   Then King Richard, a bit of a bitch, heard
   A King's Crown could be done.
   Drank a little Imperium Compound
   And became the Aten King, first one!                    

   Duchess Malinda, who doesn't do windas,
   But she does a lot of Duchess Things,
   But give her a LOT of Imperium Compound,
   And she sings and sings and sings and sings and sings!   

   Duke Sir Brion, with his pretty white suit on,
   Is a model of goodness and purity
   Never touches Imperium Compound
(spoken:) And I'll sell ya seashore property in Yuma, too!  

   Optional last verse:

   Many tales abound of Imperium Compound
   And its' strange effects on Royalty,
   But after an hour, this song has no power,
   And by now, it's boring ME!                            

   AltChorus: Oh it's too long, too long, too long
              To sing the whole song, the song, the song
              Longer than a Royal Court, it is!
              But sing it serial, this ditty Imperial
              And you'll be a bardic whiz!

        Last night I had the strangest dream in this bleak century
        I dreamed that people the world around believed in Chivalry

        I dreamed I saw a Kingly Crown enshrined in laurel leaves
        with Grace and Joy and Purity attendant at his feet

        I dreamed I saw the perfect Knight receive his accolade
        and minstrels sang and children laughed in some soft forest glade

        I dreamed I saw the finest thing that ever man could make
        grow great and strong and undefiled: Pray God I never wake!

        Last night I had the strangest dream in this bleak century
        I dreamed that people the world around believed in Chivalry

               (to the tune of "Good King Wenceslaus")

                Locksley Monsters never yield
                on the field of battle
                strike the helm and bash the shield
                make their eyeteeth rattle
                Bodies on the ground will lie
                bones will burst in sunder
                search for Locksleys' enemies:
                You'll find them six feet under!

                              SONG OF IVANOF

            There is a man who we know well that does the best he can
            but he's displayed in armour made of reticulated garbage cans!

            He looks so fine and fair and strong, oh how he plays the man
            and how it's prized, those galvanized, reticulated garbage cans

            The noblest Roman of them all, a good Praetorian
            a combatant who wears no pants, judst reticulated garbage cans!

            Like old Horatius at the Bridge, like the Legions of Valerian
            (O dearie me: those LOVELY knees!)
            and those reticulated garbage cans!

                         C. McCray Bethancourt

         (sung to the tune (obviously) of the 12 Days of Christmas)


1.           The first time I sent my device, The Heralds said to me

            "It violates the Rule of Three"

2.           The next time I tried it, the Heralds said to me

            "We changed the forms, and it violates the Rule of
             Three".

3.           The third time I tried, and the Heralds said to me, 

            "We upped the fees, we changed the forms, and it
             violates the Rule of Three".

4.           Another time I tried and the Heralds said to me,
 
            "We haven't got it, we upped the fees, we changed the 
             forms, and it violates the Rule of Three".

5.           The fifth time I tried it, the Heralds said to me,  

            "In a decision rendered by the College of Arms on
             August 1st, A.S. V it was decided that this style of
             heraldic design was not appropriate to the aims and 
             intentions of the Corporate Body. Holy! Holy! Holy! "

 note: verse 5 is delivered in an extremely fast, mono-
       tone, similiar to a Gregorian Chant.

           " ....we haven't got it, we upped the fees, we changed the forms,
             and it violates the Rule of Three."

6.           I tried it a sixth time, and the Heralds said to me,

            "We changed the rules, &c"

7.           A seventh time I tried and, the Heralds said to me,

            "It's against the Rule of Tincture, we changed the
             rules, &c"

8.           I tried it once again and the heralds said to me,

            "It's not a Period design, It's against the Rule of Tincture, We
             changed the rules, &c"

                                * more *



    Heralds Said To Me (cont.)

9.           I sent it in once more, and the Heralds said to me,

            "We changed the rules again, It's not a Period design,
             it's against the Rule of Tincture, we changed the
             rules, &c"

10. (sung in cold anger)
             The LAST time I sent my device, the Heralds said to me

    (sung in a state of SMUG)
             "Someone else has got it, &c"




              (nb: every single one of these reasons has been used by the
              CoA, at one point or another, to reject perfectly good
              heraldry, along with some even MORE stupid.  If the shoe 
              fits....................!!!!!!!!)

           or: Who was that Vermin I saw you with last, Knight?
   or: There may be Lice on all you Knice, but there ain't no Lice on me

           Once there was a Barony howling in the wilderness
           nestled in the Valley where the River doesn't flow
           and the folks were driven buggy by the insects in the Revel Hall
           Authenticity is wonderful, but this doesn't go!

                   Bugs on the Baroness, bugs on the Baroness!
                   That was the cry that you heard all the day
                   and the scratching can be heard from Ysgithr to Ered Sul
                   why did we come here? Let's go away!

           See them all a scratching, nestled in their armour tight
           the fleas have a melee team that's challenging the field!
           call Truly Nolen! Someone's gotta help us out!
           the crabs are nesting in our helms but we'll never yield!

                   (chorus)

           Dawn comes a-breaking, the bugs have won the Coronet...
           flea-infested Conan-clones in piles upon the lawn
           where is the Barony? The bugs have eaten everyone...
           termites got the stick-jocks, and all their sticks are gone!

                          tune: The West's Awake

                  For all the Lands where I have dwelt
                  Oh Atenveldt, Oh Atenveldt
                  till rivers burn and mountains melt
                  lest I forget my Atenveldt
                  From deserts stark to snow-capped peaks
                  from silent lakes and laughing creeks
                  sing: Oh let man find his heart's ease
                  on rocky plains
                  in desert breeze

                  For oft I thought of mighty men
                  who carved a Land with sword and pen
                  and lit a candle, burning bright,
                  that pierced the darkness; stirred the night!
                  tho some are gone their deeds remain
                  this sunny Crown without a stain
                  sing: Oh, their deeds were not in vain!
                  in sunlit days
                  and falling rain.....

                  So raise your banners, blazoned bright
                  Advance the Dream and Shine the Light!
                  in battle's crash and Revel's song
                  raise high the Flag and wave it long!
                  For all the Lands wherein I've dwelt
                  I love you best, my Atenveldt!
                  Sing: Oh the Joy that I have felt!
                  My Atenveldt
                  My Atenveldt

      What the use of wearing panties
      whalebone corsets of your Auntie's
      boxer shorts and other scanties
      best of all is nude
      there's such fun in going bra-less
      now that it's no longer lawless
      'specially if your figure's flawless
      best of all is nude
      nude is what you're born in
      shirts are never torn in
      underwear and lacy flimsies, garter belts and other whimsies
      yards of itchy cloth to put your form in
      ducks all do it, maidens rue it
      even ancient Picts in Britain blue it
      going naked's how to do it
      best of all is nude!

      If your garters aren't elastic
      tie them up in knots fantastic
      (panty hose is something drastic!)
      best of all is nude!
      If you're tired of wearing clotheses
      shed your garment 'mongst the roses
      never mind the old bluenoses
      best of all is nude!
      Nude is best for ducking!
      Worst for horses bucking!
      Moonlit nights will see such sights
          that are very best for fooling round
                              .....and elbows!
      Nudity is grand to see
       a well-known antidote to virginity
      take your clothes off and you'll see:
      best of all is nude!

                   once I talked to a great Grey Man
                   spun three times and said with a sigh
                   hadn't been for the Runes had his other eye!

                   prettiest thing I've ever seen
                   she went down underneath the hill
                   and came back out of her own free will

                   Brian Boru, on Irish ground
                   walked three times the Island round
                   Norsemen came lookin for a fight

                   got six feet of English ground

                   the Legion with it's Eagles bright
                   marched into the Pictish night
                   met them there upon the sand
                   gave em up to the Wicker Man!

                   eight-legged steed and hound of Hel

                   are you then feared of the dark?

                   The Circle forms, the Circle flows
                   the Circle goes where no man knows

                   Present is Past and Past is Me!

                   Rhiannon's Birds are still in flight

                                  by the fire burning bright

               when we shall all be....civilized....(puke)
               neat, and clean.....and WELL-ADVISED
               oh won't the Directors be....suprised?!

        Away out here they have a name for even the Ump that's Wuggly
        But the last word in Awfulness, M'Lady, you're The Ugly!

                M'Lady, M'Lady, they call the pigs M'Lady!

        Before I knew M'Lady's name and heard her constant whinin'
        I thought all girls were beautiful and the sun was always shinin'

        Then one day, M'Lady came, and stopped the clocks from tickin'
        she curdled milk, aborted cows, and stopped my stamps from stickin'!

                (chorus)

        Away out here they have a name for everything worth seein'
        but if M'Lady looks at you, then soon you will be fleein'

        M'Lady disappeared one day, and that for sure is scary
        she was the result of experiments by a deranged Vetinary!

                    WEAPONS AT THE DOOR

 Being a Polemic concerning the alleged Custom of the West Kingdom concerning 
 checking your Weapons at the Door of the Revel Hall. As the Satire is the 
 Weapon of the Bard, this said Polemic is to be checked at the Door, along with 
 swords, knives, redheaded Ladies and other such Deadly Things.....

         As I roved out to Western Lands to take the Western Air
         I went into a Revel Hall and I saw a Twelfth Night there
         but I was halted at the gate by a Privy Consellor
                 (that's the man who tells the King of the West how to go to
                  the bath room!)
         who told me I would have to check my Weapons at the door

         As I, in my astonishment, stood hung on tenter-pegs
         a Knight came in whose Prouess hung down between his legs
         the Doorman grabbed a greatsword and he struck the Knight full sore
         and gave him a reciept; he left his weapon at the door!

         a Bard was next whose goodly Voice has entertained us all
         but he, too, was prevented from entering the Hall
         and told he could not carry deadly weapons on the floor
         he left his Voice and Harp among the weapons at the door

         a Master entered graciously, a man we all know well
         who holds a 3rd Dan Black Belt, tho this he'd never tell
         the Master struggled valiantly, the Master cursed and swore
         but he left his hands, and feet, as weapons at the door

         the company was jovial, altho a bit dismayed
         for lack of proper cutlery, down to the smallest blade
         for even teeth and fingernails, each can be used in War
         were cut, and pulled, and left behind, as weapons at the door!

         And has their King not loyal Knights that He must be afraid
         of brawling in his Hall and of Assassin's bloody blade?
         the Rights of Men to carry Arms at least WE'VE not foreswore
         and a POX on them that made the Rule of Weapons at the Door!

                           THE STREETS OF ANN ARBOR

               As I walked out thru the streets of Ann Arbor
               as I walked out thru Ann Arbor one day
               I spied a young Mongol all dressed in white linen
               all dressed in white linen and cold as the clay

               I then spied another, done in on the sidewalk
               along with just about six dozen more
               their wounds were all gaping, from mace and from braoadsword
               from claymore and cannon, all dripping with gore

               what caused this grave carnage, I cried to the Monglos
               oh pray what's the reason for this awful sight
               my answer came slowly from under the corpse-pile
               "It seems that our bark is much worse than our bite....."

               the answer continued from pale lips a-shaking
               we sang all our songs and believed them as true
               the Dark Horde could never be beaten in battle
               we thought this was what all good Mongols could do...

               we went down to Atenveldt all for to plunder
               "too large to defend" was our song every night
               but Atenveldt's different from East, West or Middle
               there, even the bushes have learned how to bite!

               the Clann stole our ponies, the Scraelings our foodstuffs
               we ran into axes in AtenViking hands
               our maidens ran off with one Richard of Arkham
               and we're all that's left to return to our lands

               MacChluarains and Monsters, Lockehaven and Foxmoor
               that Kingdom is BIG and its' fighters are MEAN!
               we fought and we lost, and fled back to Ann Arbor
               we all came back home with results that you've seen

               keep away from that Land with its' cactus and marshes
               it's no place for Mongols who are bent on War
               they count their blows well, but they strick them yet better
               he crawled into his Yurt, and fell, dead, on the floor.....

       tune: the song of the Cowardly Lion, Tin Woodsman and Scarecrow
             in the movie version of the Wizard of Oz

        (Enter the Scarecrow, who singeth:)

        My wife is always nagging; my Prowess it is lagging
        I can't do anything
        she has got a reason, but revenge is out of season
        Oh I wish I could be King!

        If I just had the Crown on, I'd always have a frown on
        and the Barons on a string
        Heads they would be rolling, the Board would be cajoling
        Oh if only I was King!

        I am very fed up with the way this group is set up
        Oh I'd change everything!
        they are so high and mighty with the way that they do fight-ey
        Oh, someday I'll be King!

        Tho my wife is melancholic, and very...vitriolic
        she's a wasp without a sting!
        I'd have to supervise her with a pack of tranquilizers
        If I only was a King......

        (the Tin Woodsman joineth him, and singeth:)

        I grew up kind of cocky, and rather big, and stocky
        and straight as any rod
        on the field I'm a battallion, with the Ladies I'm a stallion
        ...Oh they'd better make me God!

        The other boys are jealous they say I'm over-zealous
        they'd do better to applaud
        the things that I am giving to this Dream that we are living
        oh I wish they'd make me God!

        They say that I'm conceited, but I'm just badly treated
        by people and by BoD
        just think of what they're missing by My Majesty dismissing
        Oh they'd better make me God!

        (the Cowardly Lion creepeth forth, and singeth:)

        Oh I could be a fighter, a great and mighty smiter
        and be the perfect knight
        it's a great and nasty shame, and everyone's to blame
        oh I wish that I could fight!

        Song of the Three (cont.)

        I could be a Cavalier drinking wine and ale and beer
        and be a gorgeous sight
        but it would cost me too much money so it isn't very funny
        oh I wish that I could fight!                               

        Let me at 'em on the field, I would surely make them yield
        to my Power and my Might
        with rattan, shinai and rapier they would nevermore escape here
        If they'd only let me fight

                She was afraid to come out to the Tourney
                She was worried that "something might show.."
                She was afraid to come out to the Tourney
                And the poor thing did NOT want to go...

                The Mongols invaded the Middle
                But the Middle did not want to play...

                  (eins - zwei - drei, but the Dark Horde wouldn't die!)

          Tom O'Bedlam's son am I, for my mind is hazy!
          I'd rather sing a song than work (if it's not too phrasey!)
          Lengthy rhymes don't bother me....truth to tell: I'm lazy!

          Yang, your yurt is very nice, and your Horde is smelly,
          And I'm sure that yak-meat will nicely fill one's belly!
          But remember this one line, or you're not worth jelly:
          FIRST you plunder, THEN you burn! That's how to be rakehelly!

          My Lady Lorelei your eyes do drive me to distraction

          Now Atenveldt your fighters, all, are most good and gentle
          And the Ladies, bless 'em all, are most ornamental!
          But that little Nikki-Toad....has me sentimental
          Though with boffer in her hand she is argumental!

          This stupid little song, m'lords, is mostly sung in Latin
          By the Goliards, of course, from vespers clear to matins!
          But I prefer a coarser cloth over silk or satins
          English is more understood, mine enemies to flatten!

          Good People all, I've made my Song, its' music's well-recited
          But my voice could use some work; the flowers it has blighted!
          It's rude and rusty, grim and bad, and squeaky like a door-hinge,
          But I'm a better Bard than you: I found a rhyme for "orange!"

                      by William Poundstone
                              1983

     Two mentalities are at work here: 1960s rock fans and 1980s
fundamentalist Christians. The idea of phonographically concealed
messages dates from the Paul McCartney death scare of 1969. For
hard-core types, the secret-message rumors never really died. Avid
rock fans have auditioned ever album release since the late 1960s
for hidden nuances. Backward messages, barely audible messages,
and messages on one stereo track only have been alleged. At the
other end of the sociosensual spectrum, fundamentalist Christians
have gotten into the act. TV programs such as PRAISE THE LORD and
THE 700 CLUB have propagated rumors of a satanic plot in the
recording industry, no less, in which various albums conceal
"backward-masked" demonic murmurings. If THAT sounds too spacey to
be taken seriously, consider that it was the fundamentalist groups
who were behind House Resolution 6363, a bill introduced in the
U.S. House of Representatives by Robert K. Dornan (R., Calif.) in
1982 to label all suspect records: "WARNING: THIS RECORD CONTAINS
BACKWARD MASKING THAT MAKES A VERBAL STATEMENT WHICH IS AUDIBLE
WHEN THIS RECORD IS PLAYED BACKWARD AND WHICH MAY BE PERCEPTIBLE
AT A SUBLIMINAL LEVEL WHEN THIS RECORD IS PLAYED FORWARD." In
February 1983, the Arkansas State Senate passed a similar record-
labeling bill by a vote of 86 to 0.
     Contributing to the quasi-occult status of these rumors is
the difficulty of checking them out on home audio equipment. You
pretty much have to take someone else's word for it, or dismiss
the rumors out of hand.
     From a technical standpoint, there are four simple ways to
conceal a verbal message on a recording. The most obvious is to
record the message at a very low volume. The message may then be
recovered by turning the volume up while playing the record or
tape. If the message is faint enough, though, noise levels of home
equipment may garble it. If the accompanying music or lyrics are
loud enough, or if the message itself is indistinct or
electronically modified, it may be hard to hear on any equipment.
     A second gimmick is to record a message on one stereo track
only. Records and tapes have two independent recordings, of
course, normally played simultaneously for stereo effect. On a
record, each stereo track occupies on one side of the V-shaped
groove for the needle. On a tape, the tracks are recorded in
parallel lanes of the magnetic material. The two tracks are called
"right" and "left" after the stereo speakers they will play on.
Otherwise, the tracks are interchangeable -- the sound mixer can
put anything he or she wants on each track. A message on one track
can be masked by simultaneous loud music or lyrics on the opposite
track. With normal stereo balance (or mono equipment) the loud
track drowns out the message track. At home, single-track messages
can be recovered by adjusting the stereo balance so that only the
desired track plays. Sometimes this trick also makes indistinct
words clearer. Even if the words are not exclusively on one track,
they may happen to be more audible on one track.
     A message could be recorded at a speed different from the
rest of the record. Then the record would have to be played faster
or slower than usual to recover the message. Unless the message
was at one of the standard speeds (say, 45 rpm on a 33 1/3 rpm
record), it could not be played normally on home equipment.
     The fourth and most commonly alleged trick is to record a
verbal message backward. Reversed speech has several unexpected
features. One is that syllables are not a constant in the reversal
process. A one-syllable word can have two or three syllables when
played backward. Thus "number nine" in the Beatles' REVOLUTION 9
reverses to "Turn me on, dead man" (or something like it), a jump
from three to five syllables.
     There is no simple way to predict what a word or phrase will
sound like reversed. Obviously, you can't just reverse the
letters.
     Reversed messages are difficult to recover at home. Record
turntables are not built to go backwards. Some have a neutral
setting, in which the pickup and amplifier remain active and you
can turn the record backward by hand. But hardly anyo
ne has a
stead enough hand to produce satisfactory results.
     With patience, it is possible to reverse a cassette
recording. Transfer the music from the original record or tape
onto a blank tape cassette. Place the cassette flat on a table.
Draw our the part of the tape with the suspected message and snip
it off at both ends. Hold the tape segment horizontally. Rotate it
180 degrees, keep it horizontal at all times. This turns the tape
end for end. Splice the reversed tape segment back onto the two
loose ends of the cassette with strong adhesive tape. Reel the
tape back inside the cassette. The sliced segment will play
backward on an ordinary cassette player.
     I rented a recording studio to test the secret-message
rumors. New copiies of the records in question were transcribed on
a quarter-inch master tape. Where rumor alleged that a single
stereo track contained a message, right and left stereo tracks
were transcribed separately. Records with alleged inaudible
messages were treated similarly. To test claims of reversed
messages, recordings on the master tape were edited out and
spliced in backward. Twenty cuts or portions of cuts from sixteen
albums were tested.


"Another One Bites the Dust"
Queen, THE GAME

Rumor: When played backward, the lyrics say, "It's fun to smoke
marijuana."
Findings: There is something that sounds like "It's fun to smoke
marijuana" in the reversed music. It is repeated over and over. It
might be rendered no less faithfully, however, as "sfun to scout
mare wanna." This "message" is the reversal of the song title,
which is repeated as a line in the song.
     Let's make a distinction between engineered and phonetic
reversals. When an artist records a verbal statement, reverses it
by turning the tape end for end, mixes the reversed statement onto
a master tape, and has records and tapes produced from the master,
that is an engineered reversal. When the phonetic properties of
song lyrics are such that they can be reversed to sound like
something else, that is a phonetic reversal.
     "It's fun to smoke marijuna" is clearly a phonetic reversal.
The lyrics are perfectly plain played forward ("Another one bites
the dust"), no so plain played backward ("sfun to scout mare
wanna"). With an engineered reversal, the opposite should hold
true: gibberish forward, clear as a bell backward. Some are
prepared to believe that phonetic reversals are just as
intentional as engineered reversals -- that the songwriter
painstakinginly planned the phonetic double-entendre. In the
absence of confirming evidence, that just doesn't wash. It's too
easy to find coincidences. If, for example, the letters of the
alphabet are recited in conventional fashion (Ay, Bee, Cee, etc.)
and reversed, at least five sound like English language words. D
reverses to "eden," F becomes "pray," S becomes "say," V becomes
"even," and Z becomes "easy." "It's fun to smoke marijuana" is
likewise a coincidence.


"A Child is Coming"
Jefferson Starship, BLOWS AGAINST THE EMPIRE

Rumor: When played backward, "son of Satan."
Findings: Another phonetic coincidence. The repeated "It's getting
better" reverses to an iffy "son of Satan," the "of" drawn out and
the "Satan" strongly accented on the first syllable.


"Eldorado"
Electric Light Orchestra, ELDORADO

Rumor: When played backward, "He is the nasty one/ Christ, you're
infernal/ It is said we're dead men/ Everyone who has the mark
will live."
Findings: Coincidence. The supposed message lurks around the line
"On a voyage of no return to see." Reversed, this passage becomes
the expected syllable salad -- no one hearing it would describe it
as anything but reversed music. Only if you listen while reading
along with what you're supposed to hear will you get anything. The
rumored version of the message is somewhat fudged. The passage
sounds more like "He's to nasty one/ Christ you are, Christ,
you're fernal/ There wiss uh, we're dead men..." There is no "in"
in what is taken to be "infernal." The line that is supposed to be
"Everyone who has the mark will live" isn't even close, though the
syllable count is right.


"Shoo Be Doo"
The Cars, CANDY-O

Rumor: When played backward, the word "Satan" repeated
approximately eleven times.
Findings: Coincidence. The rumor refers to the reversal of the "Shoo
be doo, shoo be doo, shoo be doo..." near the end of the song. Given
the mysterious logic of reversed phonemes, these three-syllable units
can be hard as a repeated two-syllable word. The word sounds a little
like "Satan."


"Snowblind"
Styx, PARADISE THEATER

Rumor: According to a mimeographed list of suspect records distributed
by Congressman Dornan, the words "Satan move through our voices" when
played backwards.
Findings: Negative. Despite repeated listenings, it was not even
possible to identify the part of the reversed track that Dornan et al.
are talking about.


"Stairway to Heaven"
Led Zeppelin, untitled, a.k.a. STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN

Rumor: In reverse, "I live for Satan... The Lord turns me off...
There's no escaping it... Here's to my sweet Satan... There's power in
Satan... He will give you 666."
Findings: Coincidence. If you listen very carefully to the "And it
makes me wonder" lines in reverse, you'll hear something approaching
"There's no escaping it." A better description is "There's no escape
do." Knock of the last syllable, and you have "There's no escape," a
complete, intelligible sentence in reverse. It's there, all right, but
it's not an unlikely enough coincidence to -- well, make you wonder.
      The "Satan" in "I live for Satan" is good and clear. The "I live
for" part isn't. The other alleged lines are unremarkable. All are
phonetic reversals of the entirely lucid forward lyrics and obviously
just accidents.


"When Electricity Came to Arkansas"
Black Oak Arkansas, BLACK OAK ARKANSAS and RONCH AND ROLL

Rumor: In reverse, "Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan. He is God. He
is God."
Findings: The BLACK OAK ARKANSAS cut was reversed. Again, pairs of
reversed syllables are being freely interpreted as "Satan." "He is
God" was not identifiable.


"Rain"
The Beatles, HEY JUDE

Rumor: Unintelligible lyrics at the end are reversed.
Findings: A true engineered reversal and not really a secret. "Rain"
seems to have been the first popular recording to incorporate an
obviously reversed lyric. The story is that John Lennon accidentally
spliced the last part of the song in backward and liked the effect.
When reversed, the strange-sounding vocals at the end become
intelligible as a reprise starting with the drawn-out word
"sunshine."
      The reversal is less apparent to the casual listener than it
might be because the accompanying music is not reversed. The ending
fits in smoothly with the rest of the song, the vocals suggesting a
foreign language.


"Fire on High"
Electric Light Orchestra, FACE THE MUSIC

Rumor: When played backward, "The music is reversible, but time --
turn back!"
Findings: "Fire on High" is instrumental. About twenty-six seconds
into the music, scrambled speech is heard. It is mostly louder than
the accompanying music and begins with a two-syllable unit repeated
several times. The seeming speech lasts for about fourteen seconds.
      Reversing the music confirms that there is a true, engineered
message. In reverse, a voice (Jeff Lynne's?) says, "The music is
reversible, but time -- turn back! Turn back! Turn back! Turn back!"
All the words are clear and unambiguous. Anyone comparing this to the
alleged reversal on ELO's "Eldorado" will have no trouble telling
which is genuine.


"Goodbye Blue Sky"
Pink Floyd, THE WALL

Rumor: In reverse, "You have discovered the secret message."
Findings: The "secret message" is at the very end of the instrumental
passage following the "Goodbye Blue Sky" vocals. It comes just before
the words "What shall we do" at the start of the song that is
identified as "Empty Spaces" on the record label and as "What shall we
do now?" on the record sleeve. Played forward, the message is less
apparent than the FACE THE MUSIC reversal: A reasonably attentive
listener might play THE WALL through and not catch it. It suggests
speech not quite close enough to be overheard. In context this is not
unusual because the "Goodbye Blue Sky" instrumental passage includes
"airport noises" and other sound effects. A loud climax in the music
further masks the unintelligible voice.
      When played backward, the voice (Roger Waters?) plainly intones,
"Congratulations, you have just discovered the secret message. Please
send your answer to old Pink, care of the funny farm..." As the voice
fades out, there may be another word -- perhaps "Chalfonte or
"Chelsea" -- after "funny farm."


"Heavy Metal Poisoning"
Styx, KILROY WAS HERE

Rumor: A red sticker on the KILROY WAS HERE cover warns, "By order of
the Majority for Musical Morality, this album contains secret backward
messages..."
Findings: This is a case of second-generation backward-masking. Styx'
PARADISE THEATER did not contain a backward message, though a lot of
people said it did. So Styx has included a sure enough backward
message on KILROY WAS HERE. It is at the very beginning of "Heavy
Metal Poisoning." The reversed speech last about three seconds. There
is no musical background. The words reverse to "Annuit coeptis. Novus
ordo seclorum." This is the Latin motto encircling the pyramid on the
back of a dollar bill. The usual translation: "God has favored our
undertakings. A new order of the ages."
      The cover sticker's "Majority for Musical Morality" is a
fictitious Falwellesque group in the KILROY WAS HERE video. Although
the sticker suggests a plurality of "messages," only one was found.


Space between "I'm So Tired" and "Blackbird"
The Beatles, untitled, a.k.a. THE WHITE ALBUM

Rumor: A reversed message. At the time of the Paul-is-dead stories,
the segue from "I'm So Tired" to "Blackbird" was offered as evidence.
It was held to contain John Lennon's voice, reveresed, saying "Paul is
dead, miss him, miss him, miss him." That interpretation seems
unlikely now, but there is a mysterious low muttering between the
songs.
Findings: The mumbling is actually just to the "I'm So Tired" side of
the shiny "space" between cuts on the record. Each of the stereo
tracks was recorded separately, twice, and a copy of each track was
reversed. This produced four versions of the two-second passage: right
forward, left forward, right reversed, and left reversed. All were
equally unintelligible. It was not even apparent whether the voice is
forward or reversed. Nor could John Lennon be identified as the
speaker. There are nine or ten syllables. The first six (when played
forward) are a two-syllable unit repeated three times. There is little
or no difference betwen the stereo tracks. Any claimed interpretation
of the sounds seems doubtful.


"Strawberry Fields Forever"
The Beatles, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR

Rumor: It was, of course, claimed that John Lennon says "I buried
Paul" at the end. (It's forward, at the very end after the music
fades to complete silence, returns, and starts to fade out again.)
But Lennon told ROLLING STONE that the words are "cranberry
sauce."
Findings: They are "cranberry sauce." The "sauce"/"Paul" part is
indistinct, but the first syllable sounds a lot more like "cran"
than "I."


"Baby You're a Rich Man"
The Beatles, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR

Rumor: On one of the tracks the line "Baby you're a rich man too"
is sung as "Baby you're a rich fag Jew," a dig at Brian Epstein.
Or some think it's "rich fat Jew" and claim it as evidence of
Beatle anti-Semitism.
Findings: Negative. The two stereo tracks are nearly identical.
It's always possible to hear words as similar-sounding words, but
basically, the lyrics jibe with the published version.


"Revolution 9"
The Beatles, untitled, a.k.a. THE WHITE ALBUM

Rumor: Various reversed and/or one-track speech. The reversal of
"Number nine" to "Turn me on, dead man" has pretty much been
discounted as coincidence (though it appears on Congressman
Dornan's list).
Findings: Distinction between lyrics and any hidden message blurs
on "Revolution 9." The eight-minute cut is a montage of sounds
collected by John Lennon and Yoko Ono. It includes discordant
music, radio broadcasts, sirens, applause, gunfights, sports
cheers, the crackling of a fire, screams, a baby gurgling, a choir
singing, and much that cannot be identified. For this
investigation, "Revolution 9" was transcribed four times, twice on
each stereo channel. One copy of each of the tracks was reversed.
The four resulting versions were compared with each other and
against the original two-channel version.
     "Revolution 9" contains a lot of talking. Played in stereo,
forward, the longest stretch of understandable speech is probably
an announcer saying, "...every one of them knew that as time went
by they'd get a little bit older and a little bit slower..."
     One believable instance of reversed speech occurs: someone
saying "Let me out! Let me out!" (once held to represent McCartney
in his totaled Aston-Martin). Two iffy reversals occur on the
backward recording of the right stereo track:"She used to be
assistant" and "There were two men..." Neither is clear enough or
long enough to be convincing. Some of the music, including the
recurring theme, sounds more natural in reverse.
     "Turn me on, dead man" is a typical phonetic reversal. The
forward "number nine" (repeated throughout the cut) is clear; the
reversal is slurred -- something like "turn me on dedmun." It has
been claimed that "number nine" must be pronounced with a British
accent or with some careful inflection in order to reverse to
"Turn me on, dead man." This seems not to be so. As an experiment,
three American-accent renderings of "number nine" were reversed.
All sound about as much like "Turn me on, dead man" as the record
did. Like the other phonetic reversals, "Turn me on, dead man"
must be considered a coincidence.
     Much of "Revolution 9" is on one stereo track only. Near the
end a voice says "A fine natural imbalance...the Watusi...the
twist...Eldorado...Eldorado." "A fine natural imbalance" is on the
right track only, though the words that follow are in stereo. One
of the longer bits of speech -- "Who could tell what he was
saying? His voice was low and his [unintelligible] was high and
his eyes were low" -- is clear on the left track, a bare whisper
on the right.
     There is a stereophonically concealed "secret message" on
"Revolution 9." The words are on the right track. They begin about
four minutes, fifty-eight seconds into the cut and run for about
twenty-two seconds. They are not likely to be noticed in stereo
because of the much louder left track. The sound of applause
begins on the left track at about five minutes, one second into
the cut. Deafening noises -- the clapping, sirens, music --
continue on the left track until five minutes, forty seconds. It
may or may not have been Lennon's and Ono's intention to conceal
the spoken passage. Given the haphazard quality of "Revolution 9,"
the concealment may have been accidental. To recover the passage,
the left track must be switched off. The right track can then be
heard to contain a sound like a stopwatch ticking, behind these
words:

     So the wife called, and we better go to see a
     surgeon....[A SCREAM MUFFLES A LINE THAT SOUNDS LIKE
     Well, what with the prices, the prices have snowballed,
     no wonder it's closed.] ...So any and all, we went to
     see the dentist instead, who gave him a pair of teeth,
     which wasn't any good at all. So instead of that he
     joined the bloody navy and went to sea.
                      by William Poundstone
                              1986

     There really are backward messages on rock albums. And the
controversy over "backward masking" and "porn rock" has inspired a
whole new spate of messages. There may have been more genuine
backward messages in the past few years than ever before.
     The backward message controversy is usually traced to the
1960s and John Lennon's avant-garde sound mixing on such tracks as
"Revolution 9" on the Beatles' WHITE ALBUM. Lennon probably wasn't
trying to conceal a message so much as create an interesting
sound.
     The matter might have ended right there had it not been for
the Paul McCartney death rumor. College kids tried playing Beatles
records forward, backward, and at various speeds to find "clues"
to McCartney's fate. In the process they found snippets of speech
from Lennon's experiments. Even after McCartney was found safe and
sound in Scotland, some listeners continued to look for hidden
messages.
     Somehow, fundamentalist Christian groups became convinced
(ca. 1982) that the alleged messages were commercials for devil
worship. Not a single indisputable satanic message has turned up,
but there were scattered attempts to ban or label certain albums.
In 1986 one fundamentalist group announced that the theme song for
the old MR. ED TV show contains the word "Satan" when played
backward.)
     Ironically, the publicity accorded nonexistent messages has
inspired several artists -- among them porn rock hearing witness
Frank Zappa -- to hide real background messages in their music.
It's easy to do.
     The performer speaks or sings the message normally, then
reverses the tape, which is mixed into the soundtrack. This is all
accomplished simply enough at any recording studio.
     What's not so simple is playing it back. More home record,
cassette, and compact disk players won't play backward. You can
turn a record backward with a pencil eraser, but it's not good for
the needle or the turntable. The only way to reproduce the message
with full fidelity is to use a professional-quality reel-to-reel
tape player and splice the tape in backward.
     We used the facilities of KLOS radio in Los Angeles to
reverse some recent records containing true backward messages.


"Secret Messages"
Electric Light Orchestra, SECRET MESSAGES

ELO's ELDORADO album was among those alleged to contain satanic
backward masked messages. A patient listening to ELDORADO played
backward reveals no such messages. You hear only what you ought to
hear -- the reversed lyrics of the songs, which sound nothing like
the "messages" claimed to be there. In the wake of such
allegations, ELO did put an (innocuous) backward message on their
FACE THE MUSIC album. Perhaps they thought this would show how
silly the allegations were. Instead, the backward-masking people
seized on this as proof that the other "messages" were real. In
the latest volley, ELO has named an album after the controversy.
     In Britain (where the backward-masking issue is viewed as an
American eccentricity), the cover of SECRET MESSAGES has a mock
warning label to youth about the hidden label. Word of the albums'
impending release in the United States caused enough of a furor to
chill CBS Records into deleting the cover blurb.
     The reversed message is easy to find. It's at the beginning
of the first song, which is itself called "Secret Messages." You
can hear reversed speech when you play the record normally. A
voice intones "secret messages" -- forward -- in the middle of the
reversed speech, lest anyone dare be so unhip as to not know
what's going on.
     We transferred a new copy of SECRET MESSAGES to reel-to-reel
tapes and played it backward. The backward message goes: "WELCOME
TO THE BIG SHOW/ WELCOME TO THE BIG SHOW."
     That's it.


"Ya Hozna"
Frank Zappa, THEM OR US

"Ya Hozna," a six-minute composition on the first record of the
THEM OR US double album, is ENTIRELY backward. The albums' inner
cover, which includes lyrics for the other songs, says, "backwards
vocal -- you figure it out" of this cut. It credits Frank and Moon
Zappa, George Duke, and Napoleon Murphy Brock as vocalists.
     Played forward, "Ya Howza" sounds like a record played
backward -- reasonably so. The vocals are prominent and
unintelligible. Moon Zappa's voice is curiously recognizable, even
in reverse. It is hard to tell whether the music was recorded
forward or backward.
     When "Ya Howza" is played in reverse, you discover that the
music is virtually a palindrome -- it sounds about the same
forward and backward. The voices are all backward. In some cases
they have been modified electronically. Many of the words are
muffled. Even after repeated careful listening on both stereo
tracks, it is difficult to make out many of the lyrics. It doesn't
help that some of the words seem to be stream-of-consciousness
nonsense. Some of the unintelligible stuff sounds like opera.
     Starting at the beginning of the reversed tape -- the end of
the forward tape -- the clearer vocals go like this: "I am the
heaven, I am the water." This is in a hymnlike register. "You are
a lonely little girl./ But your mommy and your daddy hold you." A
singsong synthesizer voice.
     The most interesting part of the lyrics is an intermittently
orgasmic rap in Moon Zappa's Valley Girl voice. There are three
short monologues:

I'm like green!
I'm like squat!
I'm like soul!
Repeat, like soul!
I'm like pull, push,
Okay, like slow, slow.

You're never too old
Like slow, like slow, like slow
Okay, I like it.


All right, faster, faster,
Go, do it, do it twice,
Yeah, that feels good,
I'm looking great,
Yeah, fer shure!
Like, no way!


"No Anchovies, Please"
J. Geils Band, LOVE STINKS

"No Anchovies, Please" is a novelty song, really a narration with
sound effects, about a woman who is kidnapped after eating
anchovies. She is taken to a "foreign-speaking" country. The sound
effect of the foreign tongue seems reversed. When you do play it
in reverse, it becomes: "It doesn't take a genius to know the
difference between chicken shit and chicken salad."


"Darling Nikki"
Prince, PURPLE RAIN

"Darling Nikki," cited as porn rock before Congress, is about a
dominatrix in a hotel lobby masturbating with a magazine. In part,
the complaint was that the album cover (flowers, and Prince on a
motorcycle) wasn't explicit enough to warn kids of the suggestive
lyrics. Senator Paula Hawkins apparently was not aware of a
backward message hidden in "Darling Nikki." The last thirty-five
seconds of the song is gibberish. The music changes abruptly and
becomes a repeated glottal sound. Then a two-syllable sound is
repeated twice, something like "heaven, heaven." Unintelligible
speech follows. At the end is a sound reminiscent of rain or bacon
frying , and wind sounds.
     Played backward, the message becomes:

     Hello, how are you?
     I'm fine 'cause I know that the Lord is coming soon.
     Coming, coming soon.

     It is clearly Prince and the Revolution singing this. The
words are clear but the intonation is funny -- the linger on some
words. Perhaps this is to make the reversed message you hear
playing the record normally a little less conspicuous.
     This is a weird reversal of the supposed secret message
menace. Raunchy forward lyrics conceal a religious secret message.


"Judas Kiss"
Petra, MORE POWER TO YOU

Petra is an obscure group that sings religious songs to a rock
beat. As further proof that things have gone full circle, the
backward-masking controversy prompted Petra to include a wholesome
backward message on their MORE POWER TO YOU album. It is in the
transition between two songs, just before "Judas Kiss." Clearly
audible gibberish reverses to this (the husky voice a cross
between George Beverly Shea and Dee Snider): "What are you looking
for the Devil for, when you ought to be looking for the Lord?"

AFL JoyceM Welcome to the Apple II Music & Sound chat - our discussion will
           be on NoiseTracker - the new FTA music program for the GS.  AFA
           Gene will be our host this evening...Gene, the floor is yours :)

AFA Gene   Hi all... well first I'd like to point out, if y'all aren't aware
           yet, that a spanking new version of NoiseTracker has recently
           been released (9 days ago) and is now available in our New Files
           library. It is version 0.5. I haven't played around with it much
           yet, but it's supposed to fix a lot of the little bugs in 0.3
           (the first version we had online).  NoiseTracker also includes
           the ability to directly import "modules," a term used for a
           certain type of Amiga song file which has become popular among PC
           users using the SoundBlaster sound card.

           Now, via NT, these "MOD" files are accessible by the GS. We
           expect to see a lot of activity on this end as far as ports from
           the PC and Amiga go. Note that you should be able to go straight
           to the PC music forum and download any recently uploaded MOD
           songfiles (there was a bug in the first wide release of the PCAO
           software, however, so a bunch of files with dates between around
           March 1991 and September 1991 may not download properly. Note that
           to use these PC MOD files, you'll have to rename the downloaded
           file "MOD.xxxxxx" if you want it to show up automatically in NT's
           "open" dialog box. (On the PC, all MOD files are named
           "xxxxxxxx.MOD" instead.)   Also, if the files are packed with ZIP
           compression, you'll need a program from the Communications Forum
           called AGATE -- it's a terminal program that includes the ability
           to unpack ZIP files.

           Now, I guess the best thing to do would be to talk about our
           favorite songfiles... there have been a few complaints, in fact,
           that people were not being "descriptive" enough in their file
           descriptions for uploads in describing the songs.

AFC Eddie  ?

AFA Gene   GA ed

AFC Eddie  Once a MOD file is unpacked with Agate, is a file type change
           needed?

AFA Gene   Nope, since all that NT looks for is the "MOD." being the first
           four characters in the filename.

AFC Eddie  OK, Thanks!

Deanna7332 Question...

JonL7      Can you list some of the features of Noisetracker?

AFA Gene   (you don't even need that "MOD." if you want to type the name in
           directly.)

Deanna7332 Did any of these mod files have anything to do with FTA's "Module
           A"

AFA Gene   Sure Jon, right after we answer Deanna's question. Deanna, you
           mean "Modulae?"

Deanna7332 Yes, that's it.

AFA Gene   Modulae was a demo written by FTA last year. (i'll get to you in a
           sec Doors).  It used SoundSmith v0.95 for all it's music. There
           is no connection between MOD files and Modulae by FTA.

Deanna7332 Throughout the demo it said "Loading modules"

AFA Gene   Those "modules" are not the same as Amiga soundfile "modules" --
           you see, what Modulae really was was a "stringing together" of a
           bunch of neat little tiny demos that FTA had written. So they
           called each little demo a "module" and thus the entire demo as a
           whole, "Modulae" (fancy plural of module?)

Deanna7332 Ok I understand.  Thank you. :)

AFL JoyceM Latin, Gene :)

AFA Gene   The term "MODule" from the Amiga comes from the idea that all the
           stuff needed to play the songfile (all the instruments + the
           sequence file) are included into one file, the "module."

TheDoors1  Gene, I have tried to d/l some recent uploaded MODs in the PC
           music area and still the problem exists.

AFA Gene   As I understand it, the problem was fixed VERY recently (correct
           me on this Joyce) and files uploaded as recently as early
           November still might not work depending on the version of the
           PCAO software that the uploader used.

AFL JoyceM Actually, Gene...I was under the impression that it had been, but
           if Doors is still having a problem, then it must not be fixed.

AFA Gene   What date was the file you tried to d/l, Door?

TheDoors1  umm 11/17, around there

AFA Gene   hmmm.... well i can tell you one thing... if it didn't work, don't
           waste your time again later... the problem is in the Apple
           software's method of d/lling files, and there are no plans to
           upgrade the Apple AO software.

AFL JoyceM I will endeavor to get an answer to that PC downloading
           problem/question :)

ThomasK63  i have a quick question... what can you use to unpack amiga mod
           files? On the PC side, that is.

TheDoors1  Agate Thomas

ELECTMUSIC Doors... what happens on after downloading..

Deanna7332 If it's LZHed you can't unless you have an IBM or
           PC/Transporter.

AFA Gene   If GS-ShrinkIt doesn't have that ability, i don't think there
           exists any such utility on the GS.

TheDoors1  What do you mean Elect?

ELECTMUSIC After you download the file... where do you encounter a problem?

TheDoors1  ok, you know when you download the file and at some point in the
           download the file starts to appear on your screen.  That's when I
           cancel it.

ThomasK63  I am sure soething good can be made w/out resorting to Amiga
           files

AFC Eddie  Yes, Doors, I believe the problem is with the PC software it was
           UL'd with.

TheDoors1  yeah Eddie.

GNO Tim    Amiga MOD files are typically compressed using LHarc.  I've
           uncompressed several on my Unix machine at school.

ThomasK63  good time for someone to make a lharc unpacker...

AFC DYAJim someone might be ;)

GNO Tim    Several people are already

AFC Eddie  Can't wait, Jim!

AFA Gene   Jon, did you have a question?

JonL7      The features of Noisetracker :)

AFA Gene   Oh yes... okay, here goes, in a nutshell, from most important to
           least:


AFA Gene   *  ability to import MOD files

           *  ability to import Soundsmith files

           *  ProDOS 8 based

           *  virtually no editing abilities (not a feature but important to
           know)

AFC DYAJim :)

AFA Gene   *  forgot: and the most important feature of all, the ability to
           hold instrument files in regular system RAM instead of DOC RAM,
           allowing for instruments far beyond the regular 64K limit found
           in ALL other GS music programs.

ThomasK63  I'll buy that!

TheDoors1  I have another question...when you're ready.

AFA Gene   GA Doors

TheDoors1  ok..is it true that NoiseTracker will take in soundsmith files and
           play them more clearly

AFA Gene   Well, as far as "what you hear," yes there is a definite
           difference with some instruments. It does NOT play the sounds
           more "clearly," but it just plays them in a different way. What
           many people seem to like about this "different way" is that
           sustained instruments (i.e. instruments designed to be played
           in a loop to simulate a long held note) seem to work better (or
           perhaps simply the way they were originally intended to work).

TheDoors1  I see

Deanna7332 Which takes up more space - MOD or NT  w/soundfile ?

AFA Gene   Deanna, it depends a few things, such as how big the sequence is,
           how many instruments you have, etc. Once you have a lot of
           assorted files, it'll probably average out to be about the same
           give or take a hundred blocks on your HD. So it basically depends
           on whether you prefer to have your instruments separate or not.

Deanna7332 Does playing quality differ with either one ?

AFA Gene   Nope. It's exactly the same either way. Loading time is the same
           too.

AFC Eddie  Can NT save songs as MOD files?

AFA Gene   Nope. It has options for Open and Close module, but these are
           still inactive.

AFA Gene   If there are no more questions, I'd like to talk about which NT
           files out there are the "hottest," since this info could be
           useful to many users who are interested in downloading NT/MOD
           files.

           My personal favorite is "Lambada," which is supplied by FTA with
           the program but is available separately on America
           Online.Everything about this file is really impressive except
           perhaps the sound quality of the horn-ish melody instrument.

           What about y'all, what are your favorite NT files?

AFL JoyceM Gene, there is a classical song for NT, but can't remember the
           name, but it is good.

AFC Eddie  I like Dragnet!

ELECTMUSIC So do I Ed

TheDoors1  I like Seven something

Deanna7332 My most favorite of all mod files is Pleasure Principle

AFC Eddie  <--appreciate's Greg's taste!

AFL JoyceM :)

AFA Gene   Deanna, i assume you got that from a local board?

Deanna7332 I got it from the PC forum here.

TheDoors1  I saw it there also

Deanna7332 I think under "Pleasure"

AFA Gene   Would you be able to upload it here? If it's really that good, we
           ought to have it available directly in our oun NT lib here (BTW
           folks, we will be releasing a new NoiseTracker software library
           soon!)

AFC Eddie  What a Forum!!!

Deanna7332 That sounds great!

AFL JoyceM Gene, do you think it will be possible for synthLAB files to be
           converted to MOD files?

AFL JoyceM MOD files?

AFA Gene   I doubt it, Joyce. The formats are so diametrically opposed in
           their entire basis of their file formats that it wouldn't be
           worth the time for a programmer to develop such a convertor.

Deanna7332 Isn't it possible to move the mod file from the PC forum to our
           music library?

AFA Gene   But..... it might be worth the time for a MIDI File Format to MOD
           convertor, since these two formats are more widely accepted.

Nuzz       they have nothing better to do Gene

ELECTMUSIC Gene.. some interesting similarities with DTune and NTracker

AFA Gene   They lose the file, tho, Deanna. :)

AFL JoyceM In what way, Greg?

ELECTMUSIC Both Prodos 8

Deanna7332 Shhh they won't know a thing :)

ELECTMUSIC I also believe Bill uses a shuttling of sound data between Doc
           Ram and Ram.

AFC Eddie  Interesting, Greg.

ELECTMUSIC Thats how he gets some of the excellent instrument quality

AFC Eddie  But Diversitune has that one distinction:  MIDI input.

AFL JoyceM Deanna, we would greatly appreciate it if you would upload that
           'Pleasure' song to our library :)

ELECTMUSIC Agreed Ed.. one of the factors FTA doesn't like to incorporate
           into their programs.

Deanna7332 I'll u/l it tonight if possible.

AFL JoyceM Thanks :)

AFC Eddie  Thanks, Deanna!

AFL JoyceM I will send Bill B a copy of NoiseTracker + some MOD files...to
           see what comments we get from him (will send when I get back).

AFC DYAJim What ever happened to that diversitune upgrade that was talked
           about ?

ELECTMUSIC That would be interesting Joyce

AFC Eddie  Bill apparently still working on it, Jim.

ELECTMUSIC I am sure he would appreciate the Prodos 8

AFC DYAJim good..

AFL JoyceM Jim...RSN....he was hoping by Christmas (this year), but he is
           soooo busy with his job, who knows?

AFC DYAJim Oh yeah, I noticed the speed calcuation in NT .5 is inaccurate
           :)

AFC DYAJim I recall he has set a lot of Christmas projected dates :)

ELECTMUSIC He was one of the first "Free Tools" experts in breaking all the
           rules for economic sake.

AFC DYAJim like for the vaporware DT inst editor like 2 years ago.

Deanna7332 Are there any Christmas Mod or NT songs?

AFC Eddie  Oh yeah, Diversi-Editor!

AFL JoyceM I know, Jim - but that I know he has been working on.

AFC DYAJim he projected Christmas for it, and it never came :)

AFA Gene   Not yet in AMS, but hopefully the Holiday Contest will change all
           that. :)

AFC DYAJim I look foreward to any upgrades..

AFL JoyceM Not that I am aware of Deanna - you have some?  hint, hint

Deanna7332 Nope sorry.  I was hoping there were some that could be u/led
           here

AFC DYAJim I'll be breaking out the xmas tune book rsn.. I should be able to
           midi a few :) (which rules out nt)

AFL JoyceM Question...

AFC Eddie  It would be more appropriate to have a converter from Appleworks
           spreadsheet to MOD than from MIDI!

AFL JoyceM If I got ahold of an Amiga song (MOD) disk...how would I convert
           them for here?

AFA Gene   You mean an Amiga-formatted disk?

AFL JoyceM Yes

AFC DYAJim Ack.. methinks you need an amiga and a null modem cable or a
           modem.

AFA Gene   Methinks Jim is right

AFC DYAJim LOL!!  Design your music in the spreadsheet then import to NT :)
           IT might actually have better editing?!! :)

AFC Eddie  Right!

AFL JoyceM Me thinks he is right.  If I had them upload to me, would that
           work?

AFA Gene   Yep; should work like a charm.

AFC DYAJim Yah.. as long as they're coming from an amiga

AFL JoyceM Great....I will work on that when I get back  (making note now).

AFL JoyceM Gene, will you get some of those files (NT) sent to that area
           tonight?  If so, I will leave the needed message :)

AFA Gene   That's all I have planned for tonight's chat, Joyce. Yep, I'll
           move some files right now.

AFL JoyceM Thanks...

AFL JoyceM Then we should have our NoiseTracker Library by end of the week in
           AMS :)

ELECTMUSIC Gene... quick question:  Are you launching NTracker from a 3.5
           disk?

AFL JoyceM Okay, guys...I will see you all the week of December 11th (may the
           4th) as I am off on vacation.

AFA Gene   Yep greg

AFC JohnC  Where are you going?

ELECTMUSIC Do you encounter out of memory problems

AFL JoyceM Night all...and Gene, thanks for an excellent chat and great
           explanations of NoiseTracker.

Nuzz       Joyce, I have good news for FutureSound owners. SoundConvert will
           support it in the first release

AFC Eddie  Great, Mike!

AFA Gene   Greg, i always keep my RAMdisk at 0 when using noisetracker. Not
           only are

AFC JohnC  Mike...SoundConvert...released?

AFL JoyceM Great, Mike.  When can we get SoundConvert, Mike? and FutureSound
           :)

AFA Gene   there a couple of bugs with memory management, but if you're
           loading in a MOD file that's really big, NT will eat your RAMdisk.

AFC Eddie  Sounds good.

Nuzz       The manual is being "layout". Release date should be about 1st
           week of Dec

ELECTMUSIC Tnxs Gene

AFC JohnC  YES.......WTG Nuzz!!!!!!!!

Deanna7332 Yes, why is there on some MOD files a stop somewhere in the middle
           ?

Deanna7332 That's really frustrating!

AFL JoyceM Mike, leave me E-Mail on when and how I can send your the $$ to
           get it.

AFL JoyceM Again...night all

Nuzz       gee John, I had to do something to explain the delay :)

ELECTMUSIC Thanks Gene for a GREAT chat!

AFC Eddie  Yes, Gene!  Great!

AFA Gene   Thanks Greg, 'night!

AFA Gene   thanx, see y'all later :)

Copyright 1987 Bob Szekely.

    John Michael Osbourne, (known as "Ozzy" to his fans), has in his long 
career as vocalist for Black Sabbath had his work with the group misconstrued 
as advocating Satanism.  In a 1983 radio special featuring Ozzy, the 
interviewer expressed precisely this point; "...Ozzy has always been shrouded 
in the darkest of Satanic imagery.  Yet if you really listen to his music, 
you'll find that what he is saying differs greatly from his image...."(1)  Even 
the group's image has often been described as "occult and diabolic".(2)

    The important point to remember here is to differentiate between appearance 
and reality.  Although the name "Black Sabbath" conjures up images of witches 
and sorcerers paying homage to Satan for the powers bestowed upon them, this 
does not make it safe to assume that the group that went by this name 
necessarily drew the inspiration from the occult.(3)  The closest they ever 
came to it was a gothic horror film featuring Boris Karloff as narrator; they 
adopted their name directly from the name of this film.(4)  Black Sabbath was 
involved in the black arts as much as Karloff practiced casting spells off-
screen.  Tony Iommi, the group's guitarist, summed it up best when he described 
the group as having basically "...the same appeal as a horror movie.  It's all 
an act."(5)










    Just as their film counterpart did, Ozzy and Sabbath found the occult 
mythos to be an effective vehicle for powerful social commentary; particularly 
when put in the context of heavy-metal rock and roll.  Ozzy himself noted that 
there are "...people who pick up my [album] cover[s] and go...'This guy's got 
to be singing about Devil, doom, death and destruction.'  Which is not the 
case...."(6)

    The late Lester Bangs likened the group to Bob Dylan and William Burroughs, 
describing them all as "...moralists...trying to deal with a serious present 
situation in an honest way...."(7)  Ozzy and Black Sabbath merely bring to 
light the many evils of our world in their work, to try and make us realize 
that we are all victim to their influence.  They hope to make us recognize 
these evils so that we may take up arms against them; a point Ozzy emphatically 
stresses:  "...one thing everybody has got to understand about Black Sabbath's 
lyrics.  They're not downer lyrics, they're just telling everybody where it's 
at..."(8)  He also cites the group's most controversial tune, "Black Sabbath", 
as a response to the ignorant hippie culture still force when the tune was 
written in 1970:  "The hippies said: 'The world is beautiful man.' (sic)  You 
only had to look around you to see how crappy it was.  It was ridiculous 
listening to that stuff, let alone playing it, so we just wrote about the world 
the way it really was and how it affected us - and we felt better in ourselves 
because we were really being honest...."(9)

    I   1   HAVE YOU EVER THOUGH ABOUT YOUR SOUL-
        2   CAN IT BE SAVED?
        3   OR PERHAPS YOU THINK THAT WHEN YOU ARE DEAD
        4   YOU JUST STAY IN YOUR GRAVE.
        5   IS GOD JUST A THOUGHT WITHIN YOUR HEAD OR IS
        6   HE A PART OF YOU?
        7   IS CHRIST JUST A NAME THAT YOU READ IN A BOOK
        8   WHEN YOU WERE AT SCHOOL?

    II  9   WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT DEATH DO YOU LOSE
        10  YOUR BREATH OR DO YOU KEEP YOUR COOL?
        11  WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE THE POPE ON THE END
        12  OF A ROPE - DO YOU THINK HE'S A FOOL?
        13  WELL I'VE SEEN THE TRUTH - YES I'VE SEEN 
        14  THE LIGHT AND I'VE CHANGED MY WAYS.
        15  AND I'LL BE PREPARED WHEN YOU'RE LONELY 
        16  AND SCARED AT THE END OF OUR DAYS.

    III 17  COULD IT BE YOU'RE AFRAID OF WHAT YOU'R
        18  FRIENDS MIGHT SAY 
        19  IF THEY NEW YOU BELIEVED IN GOD ABOVE
        20  THEY SHOULD REALISE BEFORE THE CRITICISE
        21  THAT GOD IS THE ONLY WAY TO LOVE.

    IV  23  IS YOUR MIND SO SMALL THAT YOU HAVE TO FALL
        24 IN WITH THE PACK WHEREVER THEY RUN
        25  WILL YOU STILL SNEER WHEN DEATH IS NEAR
        26  AND SAY THEY MAY AS WELL WORSHIP THE SUN.

    V   27  I THINK IT WAS TRUE IT WAS PEOPLE LIKE YOU
        28  THAT CRUCIFIED CHRIST
        29  I THINK IT IS SAD THE OPINION YOU HADE WAS THE
        30  ONLY ONE VOICED.
        31  WILL YOU BE SO SURE WHEN YOUR DAY IS NEAR
        32  SAY YOU DON'T BELIEVE?
        33  YOU HAD THE CHANCE BUT YOU TURNED IT DOWN
        34  NOW YOU CAN'T RETRIEVE.










    VI  35  PERHAPS YOU'LL THINK BEFORE YOU SAY THAT
        36  GOD IS DEAD AND GONE
        37  OPEN YOUR EYES, JUST REALIZE THAT HE IS THE
        38  ONE.
        39  THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN SAVE YOU KNOW FROM
        40  ALL THIS SIN AND HATE.
        41  OR WILL YOU STILL JEER AT ALL YOU HEAR?
        42  YES!-I THINK IT'S TOO LATE.

    In this piece, the group asserts a belief in an afterlife and spiritual 
redemption.  As grisly as the image of a hanged pontiff is, its shock value is 
a necessary part of the message:  They reject religious dogma, stating that a 
belief in God, in one's own heart, is the only guiding light to help one inn 
his life (lines 11/12, 39/40).  Furthermore, the reject religious hypocrisy 
(lines 5/6, 7/8) and peer pressure (verses III, IV) as excuses for not 
accepting God.  To clarify further:  following the crowd does not justify 
shrugging responsibility for one's own actions.

    After re-reading, it becomes obvious that this song is an ascerbic critique 
of atheism; (line 35/36) I refer here again to verses three and four.  In these 
two verses, the picture painted in one of Godless conformity and how it's 
viewed as being as foolish as Paganism.  These lyrics set an example for the 
listener by relating personal experience (lines 13-16).  However, for those who 
cannot accept this the group has no recourse but to condemn them, although 
rather ironically; they hope that their rhetorical loss of faith in the 
listener will open his eyes (line 42).










                           B L A C K   S A B B A T H 



            WHAT IS THIS, THAT STANDS BEFORE ME?
            FIGURE IN BLACK, WHICH POINTS AT ME
            TURN ROUND QUICK AND START TO RUN
            FIND OUT I'M THE CHOSEN ONE.  OH, NO!
            
            BIG BLACK SHAPE WITH EYES OF FIRE
            TELLING PEOPLE THEIR DESIRE
            SATAN'S SITTING THERE, HE'S SMILING
            WATCHES THOSE FLAMES GET HIGHER AND HIGHER
            OH, NO, NO, -- PLEASE GOD HELP ME!
            
                IS THIS THE END MY FRIEND?
                SATAN'S COMING 'ROUND THE BEND
                PEOPLE RUNNING 'CAUSE THEY'RE SCARED
                THE PEOPLE BETTER GO AND BEWARE
                NO, NO!  PLEASE--NO!!
                
                
    The all time controversy winner!  Is this not irrefutably  THE song about 
Black Magic in rock?  It's all so obvious, suffuse with evil imagery; Satan, 
walls of flame, figure in black, and damnation at the end.  Yes, I see the 
images too; it definitely concerns Black Magic.  Then again, Shakespeare's 
Macbeth employed scenes of witches involved in conjurations; does that mean 
that Shakespeare was a warlock?  Poe used to write sardonic tragedies about 
twisted murderers and the bizarre nature of acts, did that make him an evil, 
leering, demented killer?  Did either of them advocated what they wrote about?  
One has to remember that writing about something is not necessarily the same as 
emulating it.  Tony Iommi spoke out quite strongly about this:  "People are 
bringing us down saying that we are a Black Magic group.  I think they must be










getting mixed up with Black Widow.  We don't do any sacrifices on stage, and 
we're not on a black magic kick.  We wanted to do heavy numbers and the guitar 
riffs we worked out were more suited to evil things than love.  We play songs 
about black magic, but they are more likely to be against than for it."(12)  

    By now, you're probably asking yourself who Black Widow is, right?  Then 
it's time for a little history:

        Sabbath, before they were known as Sabbath, had the same line-up but 
two earlier names.  The first one was Polka Tulk, which seemed sure to doom 
them to obscurity.(13)  The soon realized this and changed the group's name to 
Earth.  Now, Earth was a blues band at the end of the English blues boom.  As 
if that wasn't bad enough, they soon discovered that not only was there another 
group named Earth, but they had also released a single.  To avoid confusion, 
they changed their name again.(14)  But what made them decide on that name?  
Just ask Ozzy:  "I just liked the name Black Sabbath because of the succession 
of vowel sounds.(15)  If that sounds ludicrous just consider this:  Sabbath was 
"...the first of the really committed, loud and heavy bands..."(16)  They 
needed a name to match the gut-wrenching power they were developing.  Tony knew 
that he wanted Sabbath to be noticed above all the rest of the British blues 
bands:  "We wanted something of our own that we'd like and people would like.  
And we wanted something loud!"










    Tony didn't hate the blues.  He'd cut his teeth as a guitarist on the likes 
of The Shadows, Buddy Holly and Django Rheinhardt, developing his own style 
from there.  But he realized the group had no future in the blues:

        'We couldn't keep playing 12-bars forever.  We just got fed up with 
Earth music.  It was jazz, blues stuff.  It was good for practice but nothing 
else.'

    In the late 'Sixties, blues groups were a dime a dozen in Birmingham and 
interest was waning in the blues boom due to the glut of groups.  One man, by 
the name of Jim Simpson, had heard Earth around the Birmingham club circuit and 
understood what they were trying to do.  He decided to take them under his 
wing.  With the aid of his massive record collection, Jim expanded the group's 
horizons in the areas of jazz and blues.  He introduced them to artists like 
Wes Montgomery, Count Basie and Jimmy Rushing.  It was from Rushing in 
particular that they derived the repetitive riff style so readily noticeable in 
their later incarnation as Black Sabbath.

    The Count Basie influence is evidenced in the song "Wicked World" from the 
first album; Sabbath drummer Bill Ward uses a "'sighing hi-hat'...in the manner 
of Basie's drummer Jo Jones."










    The influence is subtle, almost subliminal.  Yet it is one which was not 
thought capable of hard, 'heavy' rock bands in the late 'Sixties.  Although Led 
Zeppelin and Jimi Hendrix also had their work steeped in blues and jazz 
derivations (Hendrix' "Third Stone From the Sun" and Zeppelin's version of 
Willie Dixon's "I Can't Quit You Baby" from their first album), neither was 
able to match the intense energy of Black Sabbath.  Iommi has always had a 
preference for music with an original, distinct style of its' own; as an 
example, he mentions guitarists Joe Pass and Alvin Lee as two of his strongest 
songwriting influences.

    It would also be necessary that Sabbath develop a unique, distinctive style 
and image of their own.  Though they had changed their name from Earth to Black 
Sabbath to avoid confusion with the other Earth; at the same time another group 
emerged by the name of Black Widow "...who WERE profoundly influenced by the 
occult, had a male witch as a patron, and wrote pieces like "Come to The 
Sabbat."  Unfortunately, Sabbath was constantly reaping the benefits of Widow's 
publicity.

    Sabbath was a group that never minced words.  If they saw something as 
destructive, they would be sure to rub the listener's face it it.  They did not 
want their point to be missed.

    With their straightforward, sometimes brutal way of looking at things, they 
try to shock the listener's conscience back into awareness.  The imagery of 
"Hand of Doom", from the Paranoid album, is candid and condemning; it is a 
strong statement against drug addiction and rightly so...

            PUSH THE NEEDLE IN,
            FACE DEATH'S SICKLY GRIN
            HOLES ARE IN YOUR SKIN
            CAUSED BY DEADLY PIN
            
            HEAD STARTS SPINNING 'ROUND
            FALL DOWN TO THE GROUND
            FEEL YOUR BODY HEAVE
            DEATH'S HANDS START TO WEAVE
            
            IT'S TO LATE TOO TURN
            YOU DON'T WANNA LEARN
            PRICE OF LIFE YOU CRY
            NOW YOU'RE GONNA DIE
            
            
    Many people felt the group's overall direction was pessimistic and had a 
negative effect on its listener's due to that.  "Ozzy insisted that if people 
thought he was having a bad effect on the minds of young kids, they should go 
and watch the TV news where real murder and mayhem were a way of life, and 
shown night after night." (18)

    Sabbath was never negative in their message; they were simply truthful 
about waht they saw as wrong in the world.  If you "Strip away the horror 
stories, the imagery and the hysteria, (and) turn down the amps a notch...you 
have a well-rehearsed, solid blues and rock band, powered by a dedication to 
well defined objectives."  On the top of the list of those objectives was 
truth; Sabbath never feared facing that truth squarely, regardless of what many 
people thought of them.

Long, long, time ago,
I can still remember,
When the local calls were "free".
And I knew if I paid my bill,
And never wished them any ill,
That the phone company would let me be...

But Uncle Sam said he knew better,
Split 'em up, for all and ever!
We'll foster competition:
It's good capital-ism!

I can't remember if I cried,
When my phone bill first tripled in size.
But something touched me deep inside,
The day... Bell System... died.

And we were singing...

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
"Our local calls have us in hock!" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

Is your office Step by Step,
Or have you gotten some Crossbar yet?
Everybody used to ask...
Oh, is TSPS coming soon?
IDDD will be a boon!
And, I hope to get a Touch-Tone phone, real soon...

The color phones are really neat,
And direct dialing can't be beat!
My area code is "low":
The prestige way to go!

Oh, they just raised phone booths to a dime!
Well, I suppose it's about time.
I remember how the payphones chimed,
The day... Bell System... died.

And we were singing...

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
"Our local calls have us in hock!" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

Back then we were all at one rate,
Phone installs didn't cause debate,
About who'd put which wire where...
Installers came right out to you,
No "phone stores" with their ballyhoo,
And 411 was free, seemed very fair!

But FCC wanted it seems,
To let others skim long-distance creams,
No matter 'bout the locals,
They're mostly all just yokels!

And so one day it came to pass,
That the great Bell System did collapse,
In rubble now, we all do mass,
The day... Bell System... died.

So bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
"Our local calls have us in hock!" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

I drove on out to Murray Hill,
To see Bell Labs, some time to kill,
But the sign there said the Labs were gone.
I went back to my old CO,
Where I'd had my phone lines, years ago,
But it was empty, dark, and ever so forlorn...

No relays pulsed,
No data crooned,
No MF tones did play their tunes,
There wasn't a word spoken,
All carrier paths were broken...

And so that's how it all occurred,
Microwave horns just nests for birds,
Everything became so absurd,
The day... Bell System... died.

So bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
"Our local calls have us in hock!" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

We were singing:

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
"Our local calls have us in hock!" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?

I hear Valkyries a-comin                There are people into Voodoo
In the air their song is comin          there are people into Voodoo

Here's to those who copy Conan    There will be a lot of lovin
Here's to those who copy Conan    when we're meetin in our Coven
They're just Followers of Onan    Quit yer pushin and yer shovin
and that's good enough for me!    So there's room enough for me!

We will have a mighty Party           It was good enough for Sappho
In the honor of Astarte               With her lady on her lap-o
Grab your chiton - don't be tardy     She put Lesbos on the map-o
'Cause she's good enough for me!      With her pagan poetry!

Shall we sing a verse for Venus,    Well the Christians all are humming
Of the Gods she is the meanest,     Cause they say their God is coming,
Cause she bit me on my...elbow      Our God came three times this evening
And it's good enough for me.        And that's good enough for me.

We will worship like the Druids,      Some guys have a circumcision
Drinking strange fermented fluids,    On account of their religion,
Running naked through the woo-ids,    An embarrassing incision
Coz that's good enough for me.        Cut just ENOUGH from me!   

We will sing a verse for Loki       It was good for old Jehovah
He's the old Norse god of Chaos     He had a son who was a nova!
Which is why this verse don't       Hey there, Mithras! Move on ova'!
       rhyme or scan or nothin'     Another resurrection Day!
But it's good enough for me...

It was good for Thor and Odin       It could be that you're a Parsi

There are those who, when they've got e-
Normous problems that are knotty
They just take them to Hecate         Thanks to great Quetzacoatl
And that's good enough for me!        And his sacred axolotl
                                      And his gift of chocolatl
Was a time, so I've heard tell, a     And please pass some down to me!

And that's good enough for me!        But that's good enough for me!

Let us sing the praise of Horus    We went off to worship Venus
As our fathers did before us       By the Gods! You should have seen us!

And we sing in harmony!            But that's good enough for me!

Montezuma liked to start out             There's that lusty old Priapus 
Rites by carrying a part out             He's just itching to unwrap us.

We will all bow down to Allah     Where's the gong gone? I can't find it

But that's good enough for me        which is good enough for me.....!

One-eyed Odin we will follow      We will pray to Zarathustra
And in fighting we will wallow    And we'll pray just like we usta

Hare Krishna gets a laugh on         I'll arise at early mornin'

We will sing a verse for Eris           Of Great Murphy much is spoken

We will sing for great Diana         If your god of choice is Squat

I'll sing some songs to Lilith,      Now Danae was sweet as flowers,

but She's good enough for me!        And that's good enough for me!       
 
And what about this Bacchus,         Diana is a little spikey
Who lives just to raise a ruckus?    And she is a little dyke-ey

Well, that's good enough for me!     To know that's right for me!

Lilith wears a lacy nightie        That Bob Larson shrieks and hollers
And She is a little flighty        Fighting demons in his callers

She's wet-dream enough for me!     And that's good enough for me.

And that's good enough for me.       So he's good enough for me.

We will sing of Iluvatur,             We will sing of Foul the Render,
Who sent the Valar 'cross the water   Who's got Drool Rockworm on a bender
To lead Morgoth to the slaughter      In his cave in Kiril Threndor--
And that's just fine with me.         They're both too much for me.

   A little bit happy, a little bit sad.
   About a drink called Imperium Compound

           Rules the Kingdom thru Imperium Compound
           The results are plain to see!

   Subverting the Kingdoms from underneath!

              The Khan and the Kink, the Kink, the Kink,
              And the Board, their Great Senilities!
              The Western Irgun, drinks Imperium Compound
              And we're BACK, with results you'll see!    

   Lady Laurel, with Authority Royal,
   Passes and rejects our heraldry
   She needs a swig of Imperium Compound
   Then perhaps she'd deign to talk to me!            

   Lady Trude thought it her duty
   To turn a social wrong into a Right
   Proved her point with Imperium Compound
   And showed that Cheshire Cats can fight!  //and scratch//

   The Board of Directors styled themselves The Electors
   And another con they tried to swing
   Now the BoD drinks Imperium Compound
   So we no longer need a King!                        

   AltChorus: Oh the Bod, the BoD, the BoD,
              It thinks it is God, is God, is God,
              The figure of Supreme Authority!
              And if we O.D.'d on Imperium Compund
              there'd be no need for Royalty!          

   Oh, MEDIEVAL Net, we thought it was all wet
   With witty remarks, and other kinds of sass
   We'll feed our computers on Imperium Compound
   And BYTE the BoD right on its' righteous ass!         

   Good old Duncan was often drunken
   Chasing all the ladies fair
   He bathed himself in Imperium Compound
   Now he has a little savoir faire!

  ATEN IMPERIUM (cont.)

   Ioseph of Locksley, never changes his socks, he
   Runs around looking like a Cavalier,
   He stocked up on Imperium Compound
   And he has enough to last for years and years!        

   AltChorus: Oh they forgot, forgot, forgot
              The Locks-e-ly Plot, the Plot, the Plot!
              And it works the best when it is underground!
              It isn't a hassle for a green-and-white tassle
              They're the ones that BREW Imperium Compound!  

   Trelon of the Wood, he was very good, he
   Was a leader that had never been beat before;
   But Caid had Imperium Compound,
   And Imperial Roman Caid won the War!  //with help!//   

   In Tyr Ysgithr, it's regularly whispered there
   That the Kingdom is ruled over by a King    // What's THAT? //
   They're "democratic" and quite erratic....
   They've forgot the purpose of the whole damn thing!     

   King Sir Mark von, with his pretty white suit on,
   Rules the Kingdom both with Grace and Purity!
   He never touches Imperium Compound
   At least not where anyone else can see!               

   Duke Sir Deaton, was never beaten
   On the field, or in the drinking hall;
   At the Catbox War with Caid,
   Left thirty bodies piled against the wall!             

   Denis O'Titans was good at smitin'
   A Locksley Monster in every single way!
   Drank a little Imperium Compound
   And ATE Deaton's sword that day  // No! REALLY! //       

   Wotan the Mongoloid, a little bit paranoid,
   But a nice guy none the less;
   Drank a mess of Imperium Compound
   Now he's Justin du Roc, I confess!                       

   Then there's Duke Reynard, with a face like a St. Bernard
   Of the Dukes, he is the homliest
   He tends to toke up on Imperium Compound
   And go out and whomp on anybody's best!                   

   This song'll bedevil the folks at a revel,
   And most of the time it will annoy the King,
   So take a drink of Imperium Compound
   And let's go Royalty-bedeviling!                        

   Duchess Anna is quite a fan-a
   Going on a wartime shopping spree!  \\ War Point!\\
   Took a drink of Imperium Compound
   And shopped so fast we couldn't see! \\ Z-o-o-o-om!\\    (5)

  ATEN IMPERIUM (Cont.)

   Lyn of Whitewolfe, made of the right stuff,
   Twice the Queen of Atenveldt;
   Took a drink of Imperium Compound
   And the Kingdom of Caid before her knelt!              

   Duke Sir Brion, and Duke Sir Trelon,
   Won the Crown with regularity;
   Drank a lot of Imperium Compound,
   And founded a dynasty!                                 

   Stephan von Geist, was most awful nice,
   And a chivalrous fighter without any doubt
   Took a swig of Imperium Compound
   And won the Crown his first time out!                    

   All the Crusadenes were big, but not mean,
   And the finest fighters in the town.
   But they all drank Jerusalem Compound,
   Winning Crown after Crown after Crown!                 

   Good Duke Arthur couldn't get no farth-er
   A Norman King in Aten Land
   Drank too much of Imperium Compound
   And went off to conquer Engel-land!                    

   Then King Richard, a bit of a bitch, heard
   A King's Crown could be done.
   Drank a little Imperium Compound
   And became the Aten King, first one!                    

   Duchess Malinda, who doesn't do windas,
   But she does a lot of Duchess Things,
   But give her a LOT of Imperium Compound,
   And she sings and sings and sings and sings and sings!   

   Duke Sir Brion, with his pretty white suit on,
   Is a model of goodness and purity
   Never touches Imperium Compound
(spoken:) And I'll sell ya seashore property in Yuma, too!  

   Optional last verse:

   Many tales abound of Imperium Compound
   And its' strange effects on Royalty,
   But after an hour, this song has no power,
   And by now, it's boring ME!                            

   AltChorus: Oh it's too long, too long, too long
              To sing the whole song, the song, the song
              Longer than a Royal Court, it is!
              But sing it serial, this ditty Imperial
              And you'll be a bardic whiz!

        Last night I had the strangest dream in this bleak century
        I dreamed that people the world around believed in Chivalry

        I dreamed I saw a Kingly Crown enshrined in laurel leaves
        with Grace and Joy and Purity attendant at his feet

        I dreamed I saw the perfect Knight receive his accolade
        and minstrels sang and children laughed in some soft forest glade

        I dreamed I saw the finest thing that ever man could make
        grow great and strong and undefiled: Pray God I never wake!

        Last night I had the strangest dream in this bleak century
        I dreamed that people the world around believed in Chivalry

               (to the tune of "Good King Wenceslaus")

                Locksley Monsters never yield
                on the field of battle
                strike the helm and bash the shield
                make their eyeteeth rattle
                Bodies on the ground will lie
                bones will burst in sunder
                search for Locksleys' enemies:
                You'll find them six feet under!

                              SONG OF IVANOF

            There is a man who we know well that does the best he can
            but he's displayed in armour made of reticulated garbage cans!

            He looks so fine and fair and strong, oh how he plays the man
            and how it's prized, those galvanized, reticulated garbage cans

            The noblest Roman of them all, a good Praetorian
            a combatant who wears no pants, judst reticulated garbage cans!

            Like old Horatius at the Bridge, like the Legions of Valerian
            (O dearie me: those LOVELY knees!)
            and those reticulated garbage cans!

                         C. McCray Bethancourt

         (sung to the tune (obviously) of the 12 Days of Christmas)


1.           The first time I sent my device, The Heralds said to me

            "It violates the Rule of Three"

2.           The next time I tried it, the Heralds said to me

            "We changed the forms, and it violates the Rule of
             Three".

3.           The third time I tried, and the Heralds said to me, 

            "We upped the fees, we changed the forms, and it
             violates the Rule of Three".

4.           Another time I tried and the Heralds said to me,
 
            "We haven't got it, we upped the fees, we changed the 
             forms, and it violates the Rule of Three".

5.           The fifth time I tried it, the Heralds said to me,  

            "In a decision rendered by the College of Arms on
             August 1st, A.S. V it was decided that this style of
             heraldic design was not appropriate to the aims and 
             intentions of the Corporate Body. Holy! Holy! Holy! "

 note: verse 5 is delivered in an extremely fast, mono-
       tone, similiar to a Gregorian Chant.

           " ....we haven't got it, we upped the fees, we changed the forms,
             and it violates the Rule of Three."

6.           I tried it a sixth time, and the Heralds said to me,

            "We changed the rules, &c"

7.           A seventh time I tried and, the Heralds said to me,

            "It's against the Rule of Tincture, we changed the
             rules, &c"

8.           I tried it once again and the heralds said to me,

            "It's not a Period design, It's against the Rule of Tincture, We
             changed the rules, &c"

                                * more *



    Heralds Said To Me (cont.)

9.           I sent it in once more, and the Heralds said to me,

            "We changed the rules again, It's not a Period design,
             it's against the Rule of Tincture, we changed the
             rules, &c"

10. (sung in cold anger)
             The LAST time I sent my device, the Heralds said to me

    (sung in a state of SMUG)
             "Someone else has got it, &c"




              (nb: every single one of these reasons has been used by the
              CoA, at one point or another, to reject perfectly good
              heraldry, along with some even MORE stupid.  If the shoe 
              fits....................!!!!!!!!)

           or: Who was that Vermin I saw you with last, Knight?
   or: There may be Lice on all you Knice, but there ain't no Lice on me

           Once there was a Barony howling in the wilderness
           nestled in the Valley where the River doesn't flow
           and the folks were driven buggy by the insects in the Revel Hall
           Authenticity is wonderful, but this doesn't go!

                   Bugs on the Baroness, bugs on the Baroness!
                   That was the cry that you heard all the day
                   and the scratching can be heard from Ysgithr to Ered Sul
                   why did we come here? Let's go away!

           See them all a scratching, nestled in their armour tight
           the fleas have a melee team that's challenging the field!
           call Truly Nolen! Someone's gotta help us out!
           the crabs are nesting in our helms but we'll never yield!

                   (chorus)

           Dawn comes a-breaking, the bugs have won the Coronet...
           flea-infested Conan-clones in piles upon the lawn
           where is the Barony? The bugs have eaten everyone...
           termites got the stick-jocks, and all their sticks are gone!

                  For all the Lands where I have dwelt
                  Oh Atenveldt, Oh Atenveldt
                  till rivers burn and mountains melt
                  lest I forget my Atenveldt
                  From deserts stark to snow-capped peaks
                  from silent lakes and laughing creeks
                  sing: Oh let man find his heart's ease
                  on rocky plains
                  in desert breeze

                  For oft I thought of mighty men
                  who carved a Land with sword and pen
                  and lit a candle, burning bright,
                  that pierced the darkness; stirred the night!
                  tho some are gone their deeds remain
                  this sunny Crown without a stain
                  sing: Oh, their deeds were not in vain!
                  in sunlit days
                  and falling rain.....

                  So raise your banners, blazoned bright
                  Advance the Dream and Shine the Light!
                  in battle's crash and Revel's song
                  raise high the Flag and wave it long!
                  For all the Lands wherein I've dwelt
                  I love you best, my Atenveldt!
                  Sing: Oh the Joy that I have felt!

      What the use of wearing panties
      whalebone corsets of your Auntie's
      boxer shorts and other scanties
      best of all is nude
      there's such fun in going bra-less
      now that it's no longer lawless
      'specially if your figure's flawless
      best of all is nude
      nude is what you're born in
      shirts are never torn in
      underwear and lacy flimsies, garter belts and other whimsies
      yards of itchy cloth to put your form in
      ducks all do it, maidens rue it
      even ancient Picts in Britain blue it
      going naked's how to do it
      best of all is nude!

      If your garters aren't elastic
      tie them up in knots fantastic
      (panty hose is something drastic!)
      best of all is nude!
      If you're tired of wearing clotheses
      shed your garment 'mongst the roses
      never mind the old bluenoses
      best of all is nude!
      Nude is best for ducking!
      Worst for horses bucking!
      Moonlit nights will see such sights
          that are very best for fooling round
                              .....and elbows!
      Nudity is grand to see
       a well-known antidote to virginity
      take your clothes off and you'll see:
      best of all is nude!

                                  From the misty crystal sea
                                  came the Lady to the lea
                                  Sword and Roses in Her Hand
                                  spread their seeds thruout the Land

                                  Came the Stag from oaken wood
                                  saw the Lady where she stood
                                  by the fire burning bright
                                  came to know his heart's delight!

                   (end of extra verses)

                   By Sword and Harp, and Irish Hound
                   Blessed Be: the Day I've found
                   Hail to the Lady, one in Three
                   Present is Past and Past is WE

                   By Oak and Ash and Holy Thorn
                   bledded be the Day you're born!
                   Fire burn and fire bright

               they gently raised us from the slime
               and kept our hands from Hellishe Crime
               and made us a Kingdom in their own good time

               Now, Atenveldt forgets the Past
               and thinks on a Day that's coming fast
               when we shall all be....civilized....(puke)

                    WEAPONS AT THE DOOR

 Being a Polemic concerning the alleged Custom of the West Kingdom concerning 
 checking your Weapons at the Door of the Revel Hall. As the Satire is the 
 Weapon of the Bard, this said Polemic is to be checked at the Door, along with 
 swords, knives, redheaded Ladies and other such Deadly Things.....

         As I roved out to Western Lands to take the Western Air
         I went into a Revel Hall and I saw a Twelfth Night there
         but I was halted at the gate by a Privy Consellor
                 (that's the man who tells the King of the West how to go to
                  the bath room!)
         who told me I would have to check my Weapons at the door

         As I, in my astonishment, stood hung on tenter-pegs
         a Knight came in whose Prouess hung down between his legs
         the Doorman grabbed a greatsword and he struck the Knight full sore
         and gave him a reciept; he left his weapon at the door!

         a Bard was next whose goodly Voice has entertained us all
         but he, too, was prevented from entering the Hall
         and told he could not carry deadly weapons on the floor
         he left his Voice and Harp among the weapons at the door

         a Master entered graciously, a man we all know well
         who holds a 3rd Dan Black Belt, tho this he'd never tell
         the Master struggled valiantly, the Master cursed and swore
         but he left his hands, and feet, as weapons at the door

         the company was jovial, altho a bit dismayed
         for lack of proper cutlery, down to the smallest blade
         for even teeth and fingernails, each can be used in War
         were cut, and pulled, and left behind, as weapons at the door!

         And has their King not loyal Knights that He must be afraid
         of brawling in his Hall and of Assassin's bloody blade?
         the Rights of Men to carry Arms at least WE'VE not foreswore
         and a POX on them that made the Rule of Weapons at the Door!

                           THE STREETS OF ANN ARBOR

               As I walked out thru the streets of Ann Arbor
               as I walked out thru Ann Arbor one day
               I spied a young Mongol all dressed in white linen
               all dressed in white linen and cold as the clay

               I then spied another, done in on the sidewalk
               along with just about six dozen more
               their wounds were all gaping, from mace and from braoadsword
               from claymore and cannon, all dripping with gore

               what caused this grave carnage, I cried to the Monglos
               oh pray what's the reason for this awful sight
               my answer came slowly from under the corpse-pile
               "It seems that our bark is much worse than our bite....."

               the answer continued from pale lips a-shaking
               we sang all our songs and believed them as true
               the Dark Horde could never be beaten in battle
               we thought this was what all good Mongols could do...

               we went down to Atenveldt all for to plunder
               "too large to defend" was our song every night
               but Atenveldt's different from East, West or Middle
               there, even the bushes have learned how to bite!

               the Clann stole our ponies, the Scraelings our foodstuffs
               we ran into axes in AtenViking hands
               our maidens ran off with one Richard of Arkham
               and we're all that's left to return to our lands

               MacChluarains and Monsters, Lockehaven and Foxmoor
               that Kingdom is BIG and its' fighters are MEAN!
               we fought and we lost, and fled back to Ann Arbor
               we all came back home with results that you've seen

               keep away from that Land with its' cactus and marshes
               it's no place for Mongols who are bent on War
               they count their blows well, but they strick them yet better
               he crawled into his Yurt, and fell, dead, on the floor.....

       tune: the song of the Cowardly Lion, Tin Woodsman and Scarecrow
             in the movie version of the Wizard of Oz

        (Enter the Scarecrow, who singeth:)

        My wife is always nagging; my Prowess it is lagging
        I can't do anything
        she has got a reason, but revenge is out of season
        Oh I wish I could be King!

        If I just had the Crown on, I'd always have a frown on
        and the Barons on a string
        Heads they would be rolling, the Board would be cajoling
        Oh if only I was King!

        I am very fed up with the way this group is set up
        Oh I'd change everything!
        they are so high and mighty with the way that they do fight-ey
        Oh, someday I'll be King!

        Tho my wife is melancholic, and very...vitriolic
        she's a wasp without a sting!
        I'd have to supervise her with a pack of tranquilizers
        If I only was a King......

        (the Tin Woodsman joineth him, and singeth:)

        I grew up kind of cocky, and rather big, and stocky
        and straight as any rod
        on the field I'm a battallion, with the Ladies I'm a stallion
        ...Oh they'd better make me God!

        The other boys are jealous they say I'm over-zealous
        they'd do better to applaud
        the things that I am giving to this Dream that we are living
        oh I wish they'd make me God!

        They say that I'm conceited, but I'm just badly treated
        by people and by BoD
        just think of what they're missing by My Majesty dismissing
        Oh they'd better make me God!

        (the Cowardly Lion creepeth forth, and singeth:)

        Oh I could be a fighter, a great and mighty smiter
        and be the perfect knight
        it's a great and nasty shame, and everyone's to blame
        oh I wish that I could fight!

        Song of the Three (cont.)

        I could be a Cavalier drinking wine and ale and beer
        and be a gorgeous sight
        but it would cost me too much money so it isn't very funny
        oh I wish that I could fight!                               

        Let me at 'em on the field, I would surely make them yield
        to my Power and my Might
        with rattan, shinai and rapier they would nevermore escape here
        If they'd only let me fight

                She was afraid to come out to the Tourney
                She was worried that "something might show.."
                She was afraid to come out to the Tourney
                And the poor thing did NOT want to go...

                  (2 - 3 - 4, tell the people what she wore!)

                  It was an itsy bitsy teeny weenie little rabbit fur bikini
                  That she wore, for the first time, that day.
                  An itsy bitsy teenie weenie little rabbit fur bikini
                  And in her apartment she wanted to stay!

                One day in the Kingdom of the Middle
                It happened at a Tourney one day:
                The Mongols invaded the Middle
                But the Middle did not want to play...

                  (eins - zwei - drei, but the Dark Horde wouldn't die!)

                  It was an itsy bitsy tiny teenie Nauseating Mongol weenie
                  That they saw, for the first time, that day.
                  An itsy bitsy tiny teenie Nauseating Mongol weenie
                  And the Mongols did NOT go away!

                Now the Heralds made up a new Rulebook
                And to read it is some kind of gas!
                It's a bureaucrat's dream, this new Rulebook
                Now NOBODY'S blazon can pass!

                  (Win - Place - Show, tell the Heralds where to go!)

                                 (insert Bronx cheer!)

                  I want an itsy bitsy teenie weenie little rabbit fur bikini
                  On my shield, as my blazon, today!
                  An itsy bitsy teenie weenie little rabbit fur bikini
                  But "that's offensive" the Heralds all say!

                I sat down at the Revel last evening
                To a feast of green meat, and Rat Pie...
                It was cold, and disgusting, and greasy
                And I just want to upchuck and die!

                  (6 - 7 - 8, tell them what was on your plate!)

                  It was an itsy bitsy teenie weenie little rabbit fur bikini
                  With a side dish of cold cabbage pie!
                  An itsy bitsy teenie weenie little rabbit fur bikini

          Some folks call me many names, others call me crazy
          Tom O'Bedlam's son am I, for my mind is hazy!
          I'd rather sing a song than work (if it's not too phrasey!)
          Lengthy rhymes don't bother me....truth to tell: I'm lazy!

          Yang, your yurt is very nice, and your Horde is smelly,
          And I'm sure that yak-meat will nicely fill one's belly!
          But remember this one line, or you're not worth jelly:
          FIRST you plunder, THEN you burn! That's how to be rakehelly!

          My Lady Lorelei your eyes do drive me to distraction
          And the lovely Care-Cheri causes....petrifaction!
          But I, and they, quite taken are, so I can't take action...
          Therefore, Ladies, fill my cup; I'll drink to stupefaction!

          Now Atenveldt your fighters, all, are most good and gentle
          And the Ladies, bless 'em all, are most ornamental!
          But that little Nikki-Toad....has me sentimental
          Though with boffer in her hand she is argumental!

          This stupid little song, m'lords, is mostly sung in Latin
          By the Goliards, of course, from vespers clear to matins!
          But I prefer a coarser cloth over silk or satins
          English is more understood, mine enemies to flatten!

          Good People all, I've made my Song, its' music's well-recited
          But my voice could use some work; the flowers it has blighted!
          It's rude and rusty, grim and bad, and squeaky like a door-hinge,
          But I'm a better Bard than you: I found a rhyme for "orange!"

 (note to verse 4: Nichelle of Whitewolfe is now a very beautiful young Lady
 resident in Caid. This verse was written when she was 2 years old. Ask HER!

                      by William Poundstone
                              1983

     Two mentalities are at work here: 1960s rock fans and 1980s
fundamentalist Christians. The idea of phonographically concealed
messages dates from the Paul McCartney death scare of 1969. For
hard-core types, the secret-message rumors never really died. Avid
rock fans have auditioned ever album release since the late 1960s
for hidden nuances. Backward messages, barely audible messages,
and messages on one stereo track only have been alleged. At the
other end of the sociosensual spectrum, fundamentalist Christians
have gotten into the act. TV programs such as PRAISE THE LORD and
THE 700 CLUB have propagated rumors of a satanic plot in the
recording industry, no less, in which various albums conceal
"backward-masked" demonic murmurings. If THAT sounds too spacey to
be taken seriously, consider that it was the fundamentalist groups
who were behind House Resolution 6363, a bill introduced in the
U.S. House of Representatives by Robert K. Dornan (R., Calif.) in
1982 to label all suspect records: "WARNING: THIS RECORD CONTAINS
BACKWARD MASKING THAT MAKES A VERBAL STATEMENT WHICH IS AUDIBLE
WHEN THIS RECORD IS PLAYED BACKWARD AND WHICH MAY BE PERCEPTIBLE
AT A SUBLIMINAL LEVEL WHEN THIS RECORD IS PLAYED FORWARD." In
February 1983, the Arkansas State Senate passed a similar record-
labeling bill by a vote of 86 to 0.
     Contributing to the quasi-occult status of these rumors is
the difficulty of checking them out on home audio equipment. You
pretty much have to take someone else's word for it, or dismiss
the rumors out of hand.
     From a technical standpoint, there are four simple ways to
conceal a verbal message on a recording. The most obvious is to
record the message at a very low volume. The message may then be
recovered by turning the volume up while playing the record or
tape. If the message is faint enough, though, noise levels of home
equipment may garble it. If the accompanying music or lyrics are
loud enough, or if the message itself is indistinct or
electronically modified, it may be hard to hear on any equipment.
     A second gimmick is to record a message on one stereo track
only. Records and tapes have two independent recordings, of
course, normally played simultaneously for stereo effect. On a
record, each stereo track occupies on one side of the V-shaped
groove for the needle. On a tape, the tracks are recorded in
parallel lanes of the magnetic material. The two tracks are called
"right" and "left" after the stereo speakers they will play on.
Otherwise, the tracks are interchangeable -- the sound mixer can
put anything he or she wants on each track. A message on one track
can be masked by simultaneous loud music or lyrics on the opposite
track. With normal stereo balance (or mono equipment) the loud
track drowns out the message track. At home, single-track messages
can be recovered by adjusting the stereo balance so that only the
desired track plays. Sometimes this trick also makes indistinct
words clearer. Even if the words are not exclusively on one track,
they may happen to be more audible on one track.
     A message could be recorded at a speed different from the
rest of the record. Then the record would have to be played faster
or slower than usual to recover the message. Unless the message
was at one of the standard speeds (say, 45 rpm on a 33 1/3 rpm
record), it could not be played normally on home equipment.
     The fourth and most commonly alleged trick is to record a
verbal message backward. Reversed speech has several unexpected
features. One is that syllables are not a constant in the reversal
process. A one-syllable word can have two or three syllables when
played backward. Thus "number nine" in the Beatles' REVOLUTION 9
reverses to "Turn me on, dead man" (or something like it), a jump
from three to five syllables.
     There is no simple way to predict what a word or phrase will
sound like reversed. Obviously, you can't just reverse the
letters.
     Reversed messages are difficult to recover at home. Record
turntables are not built to go backwards. Some have a neutral
setting, in which the pickup and amplifier remain active and you
can turn the record backward by hand. But hardly anyone has a
stead enough hand to produce satisfactory results.
     With patience, it is possible to reverse a cassette
recording. Transfer the music from the original record or tape
onto a blank tape cassette. Place the cassette flat on a table.
Draw our the part of the tape with the suspected message and snip
it off at both ends. Hold the tape segment horizontally. Rotate it
180 degrees, keep it horizontal at all times. This turns the tape
end for end. Splice the reversed tape segment back onto the two
loose ends of the cassette with strong adhesive tape. Reel the
tape back inside the cassette. The sliced segment will play
backward on an ordinary cassette player.
     I rented a recording studio to test the secret-message
rumors. New copiies of the records in question were transcribed on
a quarter-inch master tape. Where rumor alleged that a single
stereo track contained a message, right and left stereo tracks
were transcribed separately. Records with alleged inaudible
messages were treated similarly. To test claims of reversed
messages, recordings on the master tape were edited out and
spliced in backward. Twenty cuts or portions of cuts from sixteen
albums were tested.


"Another One Bites the Dust"
Queen, THE GAME

Rumor: When played backward, the lyrics say, "It's fun to smoke
marijuana."
Findings: There is something that sounds like "It's fun to smoke
marijuana" in the reversed music. It is repeated over and over. It
might be rendered no less faithfully, however, as "sfun to scout
mare wanna." This "message" is the reversal of the song title,
which is repeated as a line in the song.
     Let's make a distinction between engineered and phonetic
reversals. When an artist records a verbal statement, reverses it
by turning the tape end for end, mixes the reversed statement onto
a master tape, and has records and tapes produced from the master,
that is an engineered reversal. When the phonetic properties of
song lyrics are such that they can be reversed to sound like
something else, that is a phonetic reversal.
     "It's fun to smoke marijuna" is clearly a phonetic reversal.
The lyrics are perfectly plain played forward ("Another one bites
the dust"), no so plain played backward ("sfun to scout mare
wanna"). With an engineered reversal, the opposite should hold
true: gibberish forward, clear as a bell backward. Some are
prepared to believe that phonetic reversals are just as
intentional as engineered reversals -- that the songwriter
painstakinginly planned the phonetic double-entendre. In the
absence of confirming evidence, that just doesn't wash. It's too
easy to find coincidences. If, for example, the letters of the
alphabet are recited in conventional fashion (Ay, Bee, Cee, etc.)
and reversed, at least five sound like English language words. D
reverses to "eden," F becomes "pray," S becomes "say," V becomes
"even," and Z becomes "easy." "It's fun to smoke marijuana" is
likewise a coincidence.


"A Child is Coming"
Jefferson Starship, BLOWS AGAINST THE EMPIRE

Rumor: When played backward, "son of Satan."
Findings: Another phonetic coincidence. The repeated "It's getting
better" reverses to an iffy "son of Satan," the "of" drawn out and
the "Satan" strongly accented on the first syllable.


"Eldorado"
Electric Light Orchestra, ELDORADO

Rumor: When played backward, "He is the nasty one/ Christ, you're
infernal/ It is said we're dead men/ Everyone who has the mark
will live."
Findings: Coincidence. The supposed message lurks around the line
"On a voyage of no return to see." Reversed, this passage becomes
the expected syllable salad -- no one hearing it would describe it
as anything but reversed music. Only if you listen while reading
along with what you're supposed to hear will you get anything. The
rumored version of the message is somewhat fudged. The passage
sounds more like "He's to nasty one/ Christ you are, Christ,
you're fernal/ There wiss uh, we're dead men..." There is no "in"
in what is taken to be "infernal." The line that is supposed to be
"Everyone who has the mark will live" isn't even close, though the
syllable count is right.


"Shoo Be Doo"
The Cars, CANDY-O

Rumor: When played backward, the word "Satan" repeated
approximately eleven times.
Findings: Coincidence. The rumor refers to the reversal of the "Shoo
be doo, shoo be doo, shoo be doo..." near the end of the song. Given
the mysterious logic of reversed phonemes, these three-syllable units
can be hard as a repeated two-syllable word. The word sounds a little
like "Satan."


"Snowblind"
Styx, PARADISE THEATER

Rumor: According to a mimeographed list of suspect records distributed
by Congressman Dornan, the words "Satan move through our voices" when
played backwards.
Findings: Negative. Despite repeated listenings, it was not even
possible to identify the part of the reversed track that Dornan et al.
are talking about.


"Stairway to Heaven"
Led Zeppelin, untitled, a.k.a. STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN

Rumor: In reverse, "I live for Satan... The Lord turns me off...
There's no escaping it... Here's to my sweet Satan... There's power in
Satan... He will give you 666."
Findings: Coincidence. If you listen very carefully to the "And it
makes me wonder" lines in reverse, you'll hear something approaching
"There's no escaping it." A better description is "There's no escape
do." Knock of the last syllable, and you have "There's no escape," a
complete, intelligible sentence in reverse. It's there, all right, but
it's not an unlikely enough coincidence to -- well, make you wonder.
      The "Satan" in "I live for Satan" is good and clear. The "I live
for" part isn't. The other alleged lines are unremarkable. All are
phonetic reversals of the entirely lucid forward lyrics and obviously
just accidents.


"When Electricity Came to Arkansas"
Black Oak Arkansas, BLACK OAK ARKANSAS and RONCH AND ROLL

Rumor: In reverse, "Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan. He is God. He
is God."
Findings: The BLACK OAK ARKANSAS cut was reversed. Again, pairs of
reversed syllables are being freely interpreted as "Satan." "He is
God" was not identifiable.


"Rain"
The Beatles, HEY JUDE

Rumor: Unintelligible lyrics at the end are reversed.
Findings: A true engineered reversal and not really a secret. "Rain"
seems to have been the first popular recording to incorporate an
obviously reversed lyric. The story is that John Lennon accidentally
spliced the last part of the song in backward and liked the effect.
When reversed, the strange-sounding vocals at the end become
intelligible as a reprise starting with the drawn-out word
"sunshine."
      The reversal is less apparent to the casual listener than it
might be because the accompanying music is not reversed. The ending
fits in smoothly with the rest of the song, the vocals suggesting a
foreign language.


"Fire on High"
Electric Light Orchestra, FACE THE MUSIC

Rumor: When played backward, "The music is reversible, but time --
turn back!"
Findings: "Fire on High" is instrumental. About twenty-six seconds
into the music, scrambled speech is heard. It is mostly louder than
the accompanying music and begins with a two-syllable unit repeated
several times. The seeming speech lasts for about fourteen seconds.
      Reversing the music confirms that there is a true, engineered
message. In reverse, a voice (Jeff Lynne's?) says, "The music is
reversible, but time -- turn back! Turn back! Turn back! Turn back!"
All the words are clear and unambiguous. Anyone comparing this to the
alleged reversal on ELO's "Eldorado" will have no trouble telling
which is genuine.


"Goodbye Blue Sky"
Pink Floyd, THE WALL

Rumor: In reverse, "You have discovered the secret message."
Findings: The "secret message" is at the very end of the instrumental
passage following the "Goodbye Blue Sky" vocals. It comes just before
the words "What shall we do" at the start of the song that is
identified as "Empty Spaces" on the record label and as "What shall we
do now?" on the record sleeve. Played forward, the message is less
apparent than the FACE THE MUSIC reversal: A reasonably attentive
listener might play THE WALL through and not catch it. It suggests
speech not quite close enough to be overheard. In context this is not
unusual because the "Goodbye Blue Sky" instrumental passage includes
"airport noises" and other sound effects. A loud climax in the music
further masks the unintelligible voice.
      When played backward, the voice (Roger Waters?) plainly intones,
"Congratulations, you have just discovered the secret message. Please
send your answer to old Pink, care of the funny farm..." As the voice
fades out, there may be another word -- perhaps "Chalfonte or
"Chelsea" -- after "funny farm."


"Heavy Metal Poisoning"
Styx, KILROY WAS HERE

Rumor: A red sticker on the KILROY WAS HERE cover warns, "By order of
the Majority for Musical Morality, this album contains secret backward
messages..."
Findings: This is a case of second-generation backward-masking. Styx'
PARADISE THEATER did not contain a backward message, though a lot of
people said it did. So Styx has included a sure enough backward
message on KILROY WAS HERE. It is at the very beginning of "Heavy
Metal Poisoning." The reversed speech last about three seconds. There
is no musical background. The words reverse to "Annuit coeptis. Novus
ordo seclorum." This is the Latin motto encircling the pyramid on the
back of a dollar bill. The usual translation: "God has favored our
undertakings. A new order of the ages."
      The cover sticker's "Majority for Musical Morality" is a
fictitious Falwellesque group in the KILROY WAS HERE video. Although
the sticker suggests a plurality of "messages," only one was found.


Space between "I'm So Tired" and "Blackbird"
The Beatles, untitled, a.k.a. THE WHITE ALBUM

Rumor: A reversed message. At the time of the Paul-is-dead stories,
the segue from "I'm So Tired" to "Blackbird" was offered as evidence.
It was held to contain John Lennon's voice, reveresed, saying "Paul is
dead, miss him, miss him, miss him." That interpretation seems
unlikely now, but there is a mysterious low muttering between the
songs.
Findings: The mumbling is actually just to the "I'm So Tired" side of
the shiny "space" between cuts on the record. Each of the stereo
tracks was recorded separately, twice, and a copy of each track was
reversed. This produced four versions of the two-second passage: right
forward, left forward, right reversed, and left reversed. All were
equally unintelligible. It was not even apparent whether the voice is
forward or reversed. Nor could John Lennon be identified as the
speaker. There are nine or ten syllables. The first six (when played
forward) are a two-syllable unit repeated three times. There is little
or no difference betwen the stereo tracks. Any claimed interpretation
of the sounds seems doubtful.


"Strawberry Fields Forever"
The Beatles, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR

Rumor: It was, of course, claimed that John Lennon says "I buried
Paul" at the end. (It's forward, at the very end after the music
fades to complete silence, returns, and starts to fade out again.)
But Lennon told ROLLING STONE that the words are "cranberry
sauce."
Findings: They are "cranberry sauce." The "sauce"/"Paul" part is
indistinct, but the first syllable sounds a lot more like "cran"
than "I."


"Baby You're a Rich Man"
The Beatles, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR

Rumor: On one of the tracks the line "Baby you're a rich man too"
is sung as "Baby you're a rich fag Jew," a dig at Brian Epstein.
Or some think it's "rich fat Jew" and claim it as evidence of
Beatle anti-Semitism.
Findings: Negative. The two stereo tracks are nearly identical.
It's always possible to hear words as similar-sounding words, but
basically, the lyrics jibe with the published version.


"Revolution 9"
The Beatles, untitled, a.k.a. THE WHITE ALBUM

Rumor: Various reversed and/or one-track speech. The reversal of
"Number nine" to "Turn me on, dead man" has pretty much been
discounted as coincidence (though it appears on Congressman
Dornan's list).
Findings: Distinction between lyrics and any hidden message blurs
on "Revolution 9." The eight-minute cut is a montage of sounds
collected by John Lennon and Yoko Ono. It includes discordant
music, radio broadcasts, sirens, applause, gunfights, sports
cheers, the crackling of a fire, screams, a baby gurgling, a choir
singing, and much that cannot be identified. For this
investigation, "Revolution 9" was transcribed four times, twice on
each stereo channel. One copy of each of the tracks was reversed.
The four resulting versions were compared with each other and
against the original two-channel version.
     "Revolution 9" contains a lot of talking. Played in stereo,
forward, the longest stretch of understandable speech is probably
an announcer saying, "...every one of them knew that as time went
by they'd get a little bit older and a little bit slower..."
     One believable instance of reversed speech occurs: someone
saying "Let me out! Let me out!" (once held to represent McCartney
in his totaled Aston-Martin). Two iffy reversals occur on the
backward recording of the right stereo track:"She used to be
assistant" and "There were two men..." Neither is clear enough or
long enough to be convincing. Some of the music, including the
recurring theme, sounds more natural in reverse.
     "Turn me on, dead man" is a typical phonetic reversal. The
forward "number nine" (repeated throughout the cut) is clear; the
reversal is slurred -- something like "turn me on dedmun." It has
been claimed that "number nine" must be pronounced with a British
accent or with some careful inflection in order to reverse to
"Turn me on, dead man." This seems not to be so. As an experiment,
three American-accent renderings of "number nine" were reversed.
All sound about as much like "Turn me on, dead man" as the record
did. Like the other phonetic reversals, "Turn me on, dead man"
must be considered a coincidence.
     Much of "Revolution 9" is on one stereo track only. Near the
end a voice says "A fine natural imbalance...the Watusi...the
twist...Eldorado...Eldorado." "A fine natural imbalance" is on the
right track only, though the words that follow are in stereo. One
of the longer bits of speech -- "Who could tell what he was
saying? His voice was low and his [unintelligible] was high and
his eyes were low" -- is clear on the left track, a bare whisper
on the right.
     There is a stereophonically concealed "secret message" on
"Revolution 9." The words are on the right track. They begin about
four minutes, fifty-eight seconds into the cut and run for about
twenty-two seconds. They are not likely to be noticed in stereo
because of the much louder left track. The sound of applause
begins on the left track at about five minutes, one second into
the cut. Deafening noises -- the clapping, sirens, music --
continue on the left track until five minutes, forty seconds. It
may or may not have been Lennon's and Ono's intention to conceal
the spoken passage. Given the haphazard quality of "Revolution 9,"
the concealment may have been accidental. To recover the passage,
the left track must be switched off. The right track can then be
heard to contain a sound like a stopwatch ticking, behind these
words:

     So the wife called, and we better go to see a
     surgeon....[A SCREAM MUFFLES A LINE THAT SOUNDS LIKE
     Well, what with the prices, the prices have snowballed,
     no wonder it's closed.] ...So any and all, we went to
     see the dentist instead, who gave him a pair of teeth,
     which wasn't any good at all. So instead of that he
     joined the bloody navy and went to sea.
                      by William Poundstone
                              1986

     There really are backward messages on rock albums. And the
controversy over "backward masking" and "porn rock" has inspired a
whole new spate of messages. There may have been more genuine
backward messages in the past few years than ever before.
     The backward message controversy is usually traced to the
1960s and John Lennon's avant-garde sound mixing on such tracks as
"Revolution 9" on the Beatles' WHITE ALBUM. Lennon probably wasn't
trying to conceal a message so much as create an interesting
sound.
     The matter might have ended right there had it not been for
the Paul McCartney death rumor. College kids tried playing Beatles
records forward, backward, and at various speeds to find "clues"
to McCartney's fate. In the process they found snippets of speech
from Lennon's experiments. Even after McCartney was found safe and
sound in Scotland, some listeners continued to look for hidden
messages.
     Somehow, fundamentalist Christian groups became convinced
(ca. 1982) that the alleged messages were commercials for devil
worship. Not a single indisputable satanic message has turned up,
but there were scattered attempts to ban or label certain albums.
In 1986 one fundamentalist group announced that the theme song for
the old MR. ED TV show contains the word "Satan" when played
backward.)
     Ironically, the publicity accorded nonexistent messages has
inspired several artists -- among them porn rock hearing witness
Frank Zappa -- to hide real background messages in their music.
It's easy to do.
     The performer speaks or sings the message normally, then
reverses the tape, which is mixed into the soundtrack. This is all
accomplished simply enough at any recording studio.
     What's not so simple is playing it back. More home record,
cassette, and compact disk players won't play backward. You can
turn a record backward with a pencil eraser, but it's not good for
the needle or the turntable. The only way to reproduce the message
with full fidelity is to use a professional-quality reel-to-reel
tape player and splice the tape in backward.
     We used the facilities of KLOS radio in Los Angeles to
reverse some recent records containing true backward messages.


"Secret Messages"
Electric Light Orchestra, SECRET MESSAGES

ELO's ELDORADO album was among those alleged to contain satanic
backward masked messages. A patient listening to ELDORADO played
backward reveals no such messages. You hear only what you ought to
hear -- the reversed lyrics of the songs, which sound nothing like
the "messages" claimed to be there. In the wake of such
allegations, ELO did put an (innocuous) backward message on their
FACE THE MUSIC album. Perhaps they thought this would show how
silly the allegations were. Instead, the backward-masking people
seized on this as proof that the other "messages" were real. In
the latest volley, ELO has named an album after the controversy.
     In Britain (where the backward-masking issue is viewed as an
American eccentricity), the cover of SECRET MESSAGES has a mock
warning label to youth about the hidden label. Word of the albums'
impending release in the United States caused enough of a furor to
chill CBS Records into deleting the cover blurb.
     The reversed message is easy to find. It's at the beginning
of the first song, which is itself called "Secret Messages." You
can hear reversed speech when you play the record normally. A
voice intones "secret messages" -- forward -- in the middle of the
reversed speech, lest anyone dare be so unhip as to not know
what's going on.
     We transferred a new copy of SECRET MESSAGES to reel-to-reel
tapes and played it backward. The backward message goes: "WELCOME
TO THE BIG SHOW/ WELCOME TO THE BIG SHOW."
     That's it.


"Ya Hozna"
Frank Zappa, THEM OR US

"Ya Hozna," a six-minute composition on the first record of the
THEM OR US double album, is ENTIRELY backward. The albums' inner
cover, which includes lyrics for the other songs, says, "backwards
vocal -- you figure it out" of this cut. It credits Frank and Moon
Zappa, George Duke, and Napoleon Murphy Brock as vocalists.
     Played forward, "Ya Howza" sounds like a record played
backward -- reasonably so. The vocals are prominent and
unintelligible. Moon Zappa's voice is curiously recognizable, even
in reverse. It is hard to tell whether the music was recorded
forward or backward.
     When "Ya Howza" is played in reverse, you discover that the
music is virtually a palindrome -- it sounds about the same
forward and backward. The voices are all backward. In some cases
they have been modified electronically. Many of the words are
muffled. Even after repeated careful listening on both stereo
tracks, it is difficult to make out many of the lyrics. It doesn't
help that some of the words seem to be stream-of-consciousness
nonsense. Some of the unintelligible stuff sounds like opera.
     Starting at the beginning of the reversed tape -- the end of
the forward tape -- the clearer vocals go like this: "I am the
heaven, I am the water." This is in a hymnlike register. "You are
a lonely little girl./ But your mommy and your daddy hold you." A
singsong synthesizer voice.
     The most interesting part of the lyrics is an intermittently
orgasmic rap in Moon Zappa's Valley Girl voice. There are three
short monologues:

I'm like green!
I'm like squat!
I'm like soul!
Repeat, like soul!
I'm like pull, push,
Okay, like slow, slow.

You're never too old
Like slow, like slow, like slow
Okay, I like it.


All right, faster, faster,
Go, do it, do it twice,
Yeah, that feels good,
I'm looking great,
Yeah, fer shure!
Like, no way!


"No Anchovies, Please"
J. Geils Band, LOVE STINKS

"No Anchovies, Please" is a novelty song, really a narration with
sound effects, about a woman who is kidnapped after eating
anchovies. She is taken to a "foreign-speaking" country. The sound
effect of the foreign tongue seems reversed. When you do play it
in reverse, it becomes: "It doesn't take a genius to know the
difference between chicken shit and chicken salad."


"Darling Nikki"
Prince, PURPLE RAIN

"Darling Nikki," cited as porn rock before Congress, is about a
dominatrix in a hotel lobby masturbating with a magazine. In part,
the complaint was that the album cover (flowers, and Prince on a
motorcycle) wasn't explicit enough to warn kids of the suggestive
lyrics. Senator Paula Hawkins apparently was not aware of a
backward message hidden in "Darling Nikki." The last thirty-five
seconds of the song is gibberish. The music changes abruptly and
becomes a repeated glottal sound. Then a two-syllable sound is
repeated twice, something like "heaven, heaven." Unintelligible
speech follows. At the end is a sound reminiscent of rain or bacon
frying , and wind sounds.
     Played backward, the message becomes:

     Hello, how are you?
     I'm fine 'cause I know that the Lord is coming soon.
     Coming, coming soon.

     It is clearly Prince and the Revolution singing this. The
words are clear but the intonation is funny -- the linger on some
words. Perhaps this is to make the reversed message you hear
playing the record normally a little less conspicuous.
     This is a weird reversal of the supposed secret message
menace. Raunchy forward lyrics conceal a religious secret message.


"Judas Kiss"
Petra, MORE POWER TO YOU

Petra is an obscure group that sings religious songs to a rock
beat. As further proof that things have gone full circle, the
backward-masking controversy prompted Petra to include a wholesome
backward message on their MORE POWER TO YOU album. It is in the
transition between two songs, just before "Judas Kiss." Clearly
audible gibberish reverses to this (the husky voice a cross
between George Beverly Shea and Dee Snider): "What are you looking
for the Devil for, when you ought to be looking for the Lord?"

AFL JoyceM Welcome to the Apple II Music & Sound chat - our discussion will
           be on NoiseTracker - the new FTA music program for the GS.  AFA
           Gene will be our host this evening...Gene, the floor is yours :)

AFA Gene   Hi all... well first I'd like to point out, if y'all aren't aware
           yet, that a spanking new version of NoiseTracker has recently
           been released (9 days ago) and is now available in our New Files
           library. It is version 0.5. I haven't played around with it much
           yet, but it's supposed to fix a lot of the little bugs in 0.3
           (the first version we had online).  NoiseTracker also includes
           the ability to directly import "modules," a term used for a
           certain type of Amiga song file which has become popular among PC
           users using the SoundBlaster sound card.

           Now, via NT, these "MOD" files are accessible by the GS. We
           expect to see a lot of activity on this end as far as ports from
           the PC and Amiga go. Note that you should be able to go straight
           to the PC music forum and download any recently uploaded MOD
           songfiles (there was a bug in the first wide release of the PCAO
           software, however, so a bunch of files with dates between around
           March 1991 and September 1991 may not download properly. Note that
           to use these PC MOD files, you'll have to rename the downloaded
           file "MOD.xxxxxx" if you want it to show up automatically in NT's
           "open" dialog box. (On the PC, all MOD files are named
           "xxxxxxxx.MOD" instead.)   Also, if the files are packed with ZIP
           compression, you'll need a program from the Communications Forum
           called AGATE -- it's a terminal program that includes the ability
           to unpack ZIP files.

           Now, I guess the best thing to do would be to talk about our
           favorite songfiles... there have been a few complaints, in fact,
           that people were not being "descriptive" enough in their file
           descriptions for uploads in describing the songs.

AFC Eddie  ?

AFA Gene   GA ed

AFC Eddie  Once a MOD file is unpacked with Agate, is a file type change
           needed?

AFA Gene   Nope, since all that NT looks for is the "MOD." being the first
           four characters in the filename.

AFC Eddie  OK, Thanks!

Deanna7332 Question...

JonL7      Can you list some of the features of Noisetracker?

AFA Gene   (you don't even need that "MOD." if you want to type the name in
           directly.)

Deanna7332 Did any of these mod files have anything to do with FTA's "Module
           A"

AFA Gene   Sure Jon, right after we answer Deanna's question. Deanna, you
           mean "Modulae?"

Deanna7332 Yes, that's it.

AFA Gene   Modulae was a demo written by FTA last year. (i'll get to you in a
           sec Doors).  It used SoundSmith v0.95 for all it's music. There
           is no connection between MOD files and Modulae by FTA.

Deanna7332 Throughout the demo it said "Loading modules"

AFA Gene   Those "modules" are not the same as Amiga soundfile "modules" --
           you see, what Modulae really was was a "stringing together" of a
           bunch of neat little tiny demos that FTA had written. So they
           called each little demo a "module" and thus the entire demo as a
           whole, "Modulae" (fancy plural of module?)

Deanna7332 Ok I understand.  Thank you. :)

AFL JoyceM Latin, Gene :)

AFA Gene   The term "MODule" from the Amiga comes from the idea that all the
           stuff needed to play the songfile (all the instruments + the
           sequence file) are included into one file, the "module."

TheDoors1  Gene, I have tried to d/l some recent uploaded MODs in the PC
           music area and still the problem exists.

AFA Gene   As I understand it, the problem was fixed VERY recently (correct
           me on this Joyce) and files uploaded as recently as early
           November still might not work depending on the version of the
           PCAO software that the uploader used.

AFL JoyceM Actually, Gene...I was under the impression that it had been, but
           if Doors is still having a problem, then it must not be fixed.

AFA Gene   What date was the file you tried to d/l, Door?

TheDoors1  umm 11/17, around there

AFA Gene   hmmm.... well i can tell you one thing... if it didn't work, don't
           waste your time again later... the problem is in the Apple
           software's method of d/lling files, and there are no plans to
           upgrade the Apple AO software.

AFL JoyceM I will endeavor to get an answer to that PC downloading
           problem/question :)

ThomasK63  i have a quick question... what can you use to unpack amiga mod
           files? On the PC side, that is.

TheDoors1  Agate Thomas

ELECTMUSIC Doors... what happens on after downloading..

Deanna7332 If it's LZHed you can't unless you have an IBM or
           PC/Transporter.

AFA Gene   If GS-ShrinkIt doesn't have that ability, i don't think there
           exists any such utility on the GS.

TheDoors1  What do you mean Elect?

ELECTMUSIC After you download the file... where do you encounter a problem?

TheDoors1  ok, you know when you download the file and at some point in the
           download the file starts to appear on your screen.  That's when I
           cancel it.

ThomasK63  I am sure soething good can be made w/out resorting to Amiga
           files

AFC Eddie  Yes, Doors, I believe the problem is with the PC software it was
           UL'd with.

TheDoors1  yeah Eddie.

GNO Tim    Amiga MOD files are typically compressed using LHarc.  I've
           uncompressed several on my Unix machine at school.

ThomasK63  good time for someone to make a lharc unpacker...

AFC DYAJim someone might be ;)

GNO Tim    Several people are already

AFC Eddie  Can't wait, Jim!

AFA Gene   Jon, did you have a question?

JonL7      The features of Noisetracker :)

AFA Gene   Oh yes... okay, here goes, in a nutshell, from most important to
           least:


AFA Gene   *  ability to import MOD files

           *  ability to import Soundsmith files

           *  ProDOS 8 based

           *  virtually no editing abilities (not a feature but important to
           know)

AFC DYAJim :)

AFA Gene   *  forgot: and the most important feature of all, the ability to
           hold instrument files in regular system RAM instead of DOC RAM,
           allowing for instruments far beyond the regular 64K limit found
           in ALL other GS music programs.

ThomasK63  I'll buy that!

TheDoors1  I have another question...when you're ready.

AFA Gene   GA Doors

TheDoors1  ok..is it true that NoiseTracker will take in soundsmith files and
           play them more clearly

AFA Gene   Well, as far as "what you hear," yes there is a definite
           difference with some instruments. It does NOT play the sounds
           more "clearly," but it just plays them in a different way. What
           many people seem to like about this "different way" is that
           sustained instruments (i.e. instruments designed to be played
           in a loop to simulate a long held note) seem to work better (or
           perhaps simply the way they were originally intended to work).

TheDoors1  I see

Deanna7332 Which takes up more space - MOD or NT  w/soundfile ?

AFA Gene   Deanna, it depends a few things, such as how big the sequence is,
           how many instruments you have, etc. Once you have a lot of
           assorted files, it'll probably average out to be about the same
           give or take a hundred blocks on your HD. So it basically depends
           on whether you prefer to have your instruments separate or not.

Deanna7332 Does playing quality differ with either one ?

AFA Gene   Nope. It's exactly the same either way. Loading time is the same
           too.

AFC Eddie  Can NT save songs as MOD files?

AFA Gene   Nope. It has options for Open and Close module, but these are
           still inactive.

AFA Gene   If there are no more questions, I'd like to talk about which NT
           files out there are the "hottest," since this info could be
           useful to many users who are interested in downloading NT/MOD
           files.

           My personal favorite is "Lambada," which is supplied by FTA with
           the program but is available separately on America
           Online.Everything about this file is really impressive except
           perhaps the sound quality of the horn-ish melody instrument.

           What about y'all, what are your favorite NT files?

AFL JoyceM Gene, there is a classical song for NT, but can't remember the
           name, but it is good.

AFC Eddie  I like Dragnet!

ELECTMUSIC So do I Ed

TheDoors1  I like Seven something

Deanna7332 My most favorite of all mod files is Pleasure Principle

AFC Eddie  <--appreciate's Greg's taste!

AFL JoyceM :)

AFA Gene   Deanna, i assume you got that from a local board?

Deanna7332 I got it from the PC forum here.

TheDoors1  I saw it there also

Deanna7332 I think under "Pleasure"

AFA Gene   Would you be able to upload it here? If it's really that good, we
           ought to have it available directly in our oun NT lib here (BTW
           folks, we will be releasing a new NoiseTracker software library
           soon!)

AFC Eddie  What a Forum!!!

Deanna7332 That sounds great!

AFL JoyceM Gene, do you think it will be possible for synthLAB files to be
           converted to MOD files?

AFL JoyceM MOD files?

AFA Gene   I doubt it, Joyce. The formats are so diametrically opposed in
           their entire basis of their file formats that it wouldn't be
           worth the time for a programmer to develop such a convertor.

Deanna7332 Isn't it possible to move the mod file from the PC forum to our
           music library?

AFA Gene   But..... it might be worth the time for a MIDI File Format to MOD
           convertor, since these two formats are more widely accepted.

Nuzz       they have nothing better to do Gene

ELECTMUSIC Gene.. some interesting similarities with DTune and NTracker

AFA Gene   They lose the file, tho, Deanna. :)

AFL JoyceM In what way, Greg?

ELECTMUSIC Both Prodos 8

Deanna7332 Shhh they won't know a thing :)

ELECTMUSIC I also believe Bill uses a shuttling of sound data between Doc
           Ram and Ram.

AFC Eddie  Interesting, Greg.

ELECTMUSIC Thats how he gets some of the excellent instrument quality

AFC Eddie  But Diversitune has that one distinction:  MIDI input.

AFL JoyceM Deanna, we would greatly appreciate it if you would upload that
           'Pleasure' song to our library :)

ELECTMUSIC Agreed Ed.. one of the factors FTA doesn't like to incorporate
           into their programs.

Deanna7332 I'll u/l it tonight if possible.

AFL JoyceM Thanks :)

AFC Eddie  Thanks, Deanna!

AFL JoyceM I will send Bill B a copy of NoiseTracker + some MOD files...to
           see what comments we get from him (will send when I get back).

AFC DYAJim What ever happened to that diversitune upgrade that was talked
           about ?

ELECTMUSIC That would be interesting Joyce

AFC Eddie  Bill apparently still working on it, Jim.

ELECTMUSIC I am sure he would appreciate the Prodos 8

AFC DYAJim good..

AFL JoyceM Jim...RSN....he was hoping by Christmas (this year), but he is
           soooo busy with his job, who knows?

AFC DYAJim Oh yeah, I noticed the speed calcuation in NT .5 is inaccurate
           :)

AFC DYAJim I recall he has set a lot of Christmas projected dates :)

ELECTMUSIC He was one of the first "Free Tools" experts in breaking all the
           rules for economic sake.

AFC DYAJim like for the vaporware DT inst editor like 2 years ago.

Deanna7332 Are there any Christmas Mod or NT songs?

AFC Eddie  Oh yeah, Diversi-Editor!

AFL JoyceM I know, Jim - but that I know he has been working on.

AFC DYAJim he projected Christmas for it, and it never came :)

AFA Gene   Not yet in AMS, but hopefully the Holiday Contest will change all
           that. :)

AFC DYAJim I look foreward to any upgrades..

AFL JoyceM Not that I am aware of Deanna - you have some?  hint, hint

Deanna7332 Nope sorry.  I was hoping there were some that could be u/led
           here

AFC DYAJim I'll be breaking out the xmas tune book rsn.. I should be able to
           midi a few :) (which rules out nt)

AFL JoyceM Question...

AFC Eddie  It would be more appropriate to have a converter from Appleworks
           spreadsheet to MOD than from MIDI!

AFL JoyceM If I got ahold of an Amiga song (MOD) disk...how would I convert
           them for here?

AFA Gene   You mean an Amiga-formatted disk?

AFL JoyceM Yes

AFC DYAJim Ack.. methinks you need an amiga and a null modem cable or a
           modem.

AFA Gene   Methinks Jim is right

AFC DYAJim LOL!!  Design your music in the spreadsheet then import to NT :)
           IT might actually have better editing?!! :)

AFC Eddie  Right!

AFL JoyceM Me thinks he is right.  If I had them upload to me, would that
           work?

AFA Gene   Yep; should work like a charm.

AFC DYAJim Yah.. as long as they're coming from an amiga

AFL JoyceM Great....I will work on that when I get back  (making note now).

AFL JoyceM Gene, will you get some of those files (NT) sent to that area
           tonight?  If so, I will leave the needed message :)

AFA Gene   That's all I have planned for tonight's chat, Joyce. Yep, I'll
           move some files right now.

AFL JoyceM Thanks...

AFL JoyceM Then we should have our NoiseTracker Library by end of the week in
           AMS :)

ELECTMUSIC Gene... quick question:  Are you launching NTracker from a 3.5
           disk?

AFL JoyceM Okay, guys...I will see you all the week of December 11th (may the
           4th) as I am off on vacation.

AFA Gene   Yep greg

AFC JohnC  Where are you going?

ELECTMUSIC Do you encounter out of memory problems

AFL JoyceM Night all...and Gene, thanks for an excellent chat and great
           explanations of NoiseTracker.

Nuzz       Joyce, I have good news for FutureSound owners. SoundConvert will
           support it in the first release

AFC Eddie  Great, Mike!

AFA Gene   Greg, i always keep my RAMdisk at 0 when using noisetracker. Not
           only are

AFC JohnC  Mike...SoundConvert...released?

AFL JoyceM Great, Mike.  When can we get SoundConvert, Mike? and FutureSound
           :)

AFA Gene   there a couple of bugs with memory management, but if you're
           loading in a MOD file that's really big, NT will eat your RAMdisk.

AFC Eddie  Sounds good.

Nuzz       The manual is being "layout". Release date should be about 1st
           week of Dec

ELECTMUSIC Tnxs Gene

AFC JohnC  YES.......WTG Nuzz!!!!!!!!

Deanna7332 Yes, why is there on some MOD files a stop somewhere in the middle
           ?

Deanna7332 That's really frustrating!

AFL JoyceM Mike, leave me E-Mail on when and how I can send your the $$ to
           get it.

AFL JoyceM Again...night all

Nuzz       gee John, I had to do something to explain the delay :)

ELECTMUSIC Thanks Gene for a GREAT chat!

AFC Eddie  Yes, Gene!  Great!

AFA Gene   Thanks Greg, 'night!

AFA Gene   thanx, see y'all later :)

Copyright 1987 Bob Szekely.

    John Michael Osbourne, (known as "Ozzy" to his fans), has in his long 
career as vocalist for Black Sabbath had his work with the group misconstrued 
as advocating Satanism.  In a 1983 radio special featuring Ozzy, the 
interviewer expressed precisely this point; "...Ozzy has always been shrouded 
in the darkest of Satanic imagery.  Yet if you really listen to his music, 
you'll find that what he is saying differs greatly from his image...."(1)  Even 
the group's image has often been described as "occult and diabolic".(2)

    The important point to remember here is to differentiate between appearance 
and reality.  Although the name "Black Sabbath" conjures up images of witches 
and sorcerers paying homage to Satan for the powers bestowed upon them, this 
does not make it safe to assume that the group that went by this name 
necessarily drew the inspiration from the occult.(3)  The closest they ever 
came to it was a gothic horror film featuring Boris Karloff as narrator; they 
adopted their name directly from the name of this film.(4)  Black Sabbath was 
involved in the black arts as much as Karloff practiced casting spells off-
screen.  Tony Iommi, the group's guitarist, summed it up best when he described 
the group as having basically "...the same appeal as a horror movie.  It's all 
an act."(5)










    Just as their film counterpart did, Ozzy and Sabbath found the occult 
mythos to be an effective vehicle for powerful social commentary; particularly 
when put in the context of heavy-metal rock and roll.  Ozzy himself noted that 
there are "...people who pick up my [album] cover[s] and go...'This guy's got 
to be singing about Devil, doom, death and destruction.'  Which is not the 
case...."(6)

    The late Lester Bangs likened the group to Bob Dylan and William Burroughs, 
describing them all as "...moralists...trying to deal with a serious present 
situation in an honest way...."(7)  Ozzy and Black Sabbath merely bring to 
light the many evils of our world in their work, to try and make us realize 
that we are all victim to their influence.  They hope to make us recognize 
these evils so that we may take up arms against them; a point Ozzy emphatically 
stresses:  "...one thing everybody has got to understand about Black Sabbath's 
lyrics.  They're not downer lyrics, they're just telling everybody where it's 
at..."(8)  He also cites the group's most controversial tune, "Black Sabbath", 
as a response to the ignorant hippie culture still force when the tune was 
written in 1970:  "The hippies said: 'The world is beautiful man.' (sic)  You 
only had to look around you to see how crappy it was.  It was ridiculous 
listening to that stuff, let alone playing it, so we just wrote about the world 
the way it really was and how it affected us - and we felt better in ourselves 
because we were really being honest...."(9)

        2   CAN IT BE SAVED?
        3   OR PERHAPS YOU THINK THAT WHEN YOU ARE DEAD
        4   YOU JUST STAY IN YOUR GRAVE.
        5   IS GOD JUST A THOUGHT WITHIN YOUR HEAD OR IS
        6   HE A PART OF YOU?
        7   IS CHRIST JUST A NAME THAT YOU READ IN A BOOK
        8   WHEN YOU WERE AT SCHOOL?

    II  9   WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT DEATH DO YOU LOSE
        10  YOUR BREATH OR DO YOU KEEP YOUR COOL?
        11  WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE THE POPE ON THE END
        12  OF A ROPE - DO YOU THINK HE'S A FOOL?
        13  WELL I'VE SEEN THE TRUTH - YES I'VE SEEN 
        14  THE LIGHT AND I'VE CHANGED MY WAYS.

        18  FRIENDS MIGHT SAY 
        19  IF THEY NEW YOU BELIEVED IN GOD ABOVE

        21  THAT GOD IS THE ONLY WAY TO LOVE.

        24 IN WITH THE PACK WHEREVER THEY RUN

        32  SAY YOU DON'T BELIEVE?
        33  YOU HAD THE CHANCE BUT YOU TURNED IT DOWN
        34  NOW YOU CAN'T RETRIEVE.










    VI  35  PERHAPS YOU'LL THINK BEFORE YOU SAY THAT
        36  GOD IS DEAD AND GONE
        37  OPEN YOUR EYES, JUST REALIZE THAT HE IS THE
        38  ONE.
        39  THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN SAVE YOU KNOW FROM
        40  ALL THIS SIN AND HATE.
        41  OR WILL YOU STILL JEER AT ALL YOU HEAR?
        42  YES!-I THINK IT'S TOO LATE.

    In this piece, the group asserts a belief in an afterlife and spiritual 
redemption.  As grisly as the image of a hanged pontiff is, its shock value is 
a necessary part of the message:  They reject religious dogma, stating that a 
belief in God, in one's own heart, is the only guiding light to help one inn 
his life (lines 11/12, 39/40).  Furthermore, the reject religious hypocrisy 
(lines 5/6, 7/8) and peer pressure (verses III, IV) as excuses for not 
accepting God.  To clarify further:  following the crowd does not justify 
shrugging responsibility for one's own actions.

    After re-reading, it becomes obvious that this song is an ascerbic critique 
of atheism; (line 35/36) I refer here again to verses three and four.  In these 
two verses, the picture painted in one of Godless conformity and how it's 
viewed as being as foolish as Paganism.  These lyrics set an example for the 
listener by relating personal experience (lines 13-16).  However, for those who 
cannot accept this the group has no recourse but to condemn them, although 
rather ironically; they hope that their rhetorical loss of faith in the 
listener will open his eyes (line 42).










                           B L A C K   S A B B A T H 



            WHAT IS THIS, THAT STANDS BEFORE ME?
            FIGURE IN BLACK, WHICH POINTS AT ME
            TURN ROUND QUICK AND START TO RUN
            FIND OUT I'M THE CHOSEN ONE.  OH, NO!
            
            BIG BLACK SHAPE WITH EYES OF FIRE
            TELLING PEOPLE THEIR DESIRE
            SATAN'S SITTING THERE, HE'S SMILING
            WATCHES THOSE FLAMES GET HIGHER AND HIGHER
            OH, NO, NO, -- PLEASE GOD HELP ME!
            
                IS THIS THE END MY FRIEND?
                SATAN'S COMING 'ROUND THE BEND

                THE PEOPLE BETTER GO AND BEWARE
                NO, NO!  PLEASE--NO!!
                
                
    The all time controversy winner!  Is this not irrefutably  THE song about 
Black Magic in rock?  It's all so obvious, suffuse with evil imagery; Satan, 
walls of flame, figure in black, and damnation at the end.  Yes, I see the 
images too; it definitely concerns Black Magic.  Then again, Shakespeare's 
Macbeth employed scenes of witches involved in conjurations; does that mean 
that Shakespeare was a warlock?  Poe used to write sardonic tragedies about 
twisted murderers and the bizarre nature of acts, did that make him an evil, 
leering, demented killer?  Did either of them advocated what they wrote about?  
One has to remember that writing about something is not necessarily the same as 
emulating it.  Tony Iommi spoke out quite strongly about this:  "People are 
bringing us down saying that we are a Black Magic group.  I think they must be










getting mixed up with Black Widow.  We don't do any sacrifices on stage, and 
we're not on a black magic kick.  We wanted to do heavy numbers and the guitar 
riffs we worked out were more suited to evil things than love.  We play songs 
about black magic, but they are more likely to be against than for it."(12)  

    By now, you're probably asking yourself who Black Widow is, right?  Then 
it's time for a little history:

        Sabbath, before they were known as Sabbath, had the same line-up but 
two earlier names.  The first one was Polka Tulk, which seemed sure to doom 
them to obscurity.(13)  The soon realized this and changed the group's name to 
Earth.  Now, Earth was a blues band at the end of the English blues boom.  As 
if that wasn't bad enough, they soon discovered that not only was there another 
group named Earth, but they had also released a single.  To avoid confusion, 
they changed their name again.(14)  But what made them decide on that name?  
Just ask Ozzy:  "I just liked the name Black Sabbath because of the succession 
of vowel sounds.(15)  If that sounds ludicrous just consider this:  Sabbath was 
"...the first of the really committed, loud and heavy bands..."(16)  They 
needed a name to match the gut-wrenching power they were developing.  Tony knew 
that he wanted Sabbath to be noticed above all the rest of the British blues 
bands:  "We wanted something of our own that we'd like and people would like.  
And we wanted something loud!"










    Tony didn't hate the blues.  He'd cut his teeth as a guitarist on the likes 
of The Shadows, Buddy Holly and Django Rheinhardt, developing his own style 
from there.  But he realized the group had no future in the blues:

        'We couldn't keep playing 12-bars forever.  We just got fed up with 
Earth music.  It was jazz, blues stuff.  It was good for practice but nothing 
else.'

    In the late 'Sixties, blues groups were a dime a dozen in Birmingham and 
interest was waning in the blues boom due to the glut of groups.  One man, by 
the name of Jim Simpson, had heard Earth around the Birmingham club circuit and 
understood what they were trying to do.  He decided to take them under his 
wing.  With the aid of his massive record collection, Jim expanded the group's 
horizons in the areas of jazz and blues.  He introduced them to artists like 
Wes Montgomery, Count Basie and Jimmy Rushing.  It was from Rushing in 
particular that they derived the repetitive riff style so readily noticeable in 
their later incarnation as Black Sabbath.

    The Count Basie influence is evidenced in the song "Wicked World" from the 
first album; Sabbath drummer Bill Ward uses a "'sighing hi-hat'...in the manner 
of Basie's drummer Jo Jones."










    The influence is subtle, almost subliminal.  Yet it is one which was not 
thought capable of hard, 'heavy' rock bands in the late 'Sixties.  Although Led 
Zeppelin and Jimi Hendrix also had their work steeped in blues and jazz 
derivations (Hendrix' "Third Stone From the Sun" and Zeppelin's version of 
Willie Dixon's "I Can't Quit You Baby" from their first album), neither was 
able to match the intense energy of Black Sabbath.  Iommi has always had a 
preference for music with an original, distinct style of its' own; as an 
example, he mentions guitarists Joe Pass and Alvin Lee as two of his strongest 
songwriting influences.

    It would also be necessary that Sabbath develop a unique, distinctive style 
and image of their own.  Though they had changed their name from Earth to Black 
Sabbath to avoid confusion with the other Earth; at the same time another group 
emerged by the name of Black Widow "...who WERE profoundly influenced by the 
occult, had a male witch as a patron, and wrote pieces like "Come to The 
Sabbat."  Unfortunately, Sabbath was constantly reaping the benefits of Widow's 
publicity.

    Sabbath was a group that never minced words.  If they saw something as 
destructive, they would be sure to rub the listener's face it it.  They did not 
want their point to be missed.

    With their straightforward, sometimes brutal way of looking at things, they 
try to shock the listener's conscience back into awareness.  The imagery of 
"Hand of Doom", from the Paranoid album, is candid and condemning; it is a 
strong statement against drug addiction and rightly so...

    Many people felt the group's overall direction was pessimistic and had a 
negative effect on its listener's due to that.  "Ozzy insisted that if people 
thought he was having a bad effect on the minds of young kids, they should go 
and watch the TV news where real murder and mayhem were a way of life, and 
shown night after night." (18)

    Sabbath was never negative in their message; they were simply truthful 
about waht they saw as wrong in the world.  If you "Strip away the horror 
stories, the imagery and the hysteria, (and) turn down the amps a notch...you 
have a well-rehearsed, solid blues and rock band, powered by a dedication to 
well defined objectives."  On the top of the list of those objectives was 
truth; Sabbath never feared facing that truth squarely, regardless of what many 
people thought of them.

Long, long, time ago,
I can still remember,
When the local calls were "free".
And I knew if I paid my bill,
And never wished them any ill,
That the phone company would let me be...

But Uncle Sam said he knew better,
Split 'em up, for all and ever!
We'll foster competition:
It's good capital-ism!

I can't remember if I cried,
When my phone bill first tripled in size.
But something touched me deep inside,
The day... Bell System... died.

And we were singing...

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
"Our local calls have us in hock!" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

Is your office Step by Step,
Or have you gotten some Crossbar yet?
Everybody used to ask...
Oh, is TSPS coming soon?
IDDD will be a boon!
And, I hope to get a Touch-Tone phone, real soon...

The color phones are really neat,
And direct dialing can't be beat!
My area code is "low":
The prestige way to go!

Oh, they just raised phone booths to a dime!
Well, I suppose it's about time.
I remember how the payphones chimed,
The day... Bell System... died.

And we were singing...

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
"Our local calls have us in hock!" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

Back then we were all at one rate,
Phone installs didn't cause debate,
About who'd put which wire where...
Installers came right out to you,
No "phone stores" with their ballyhoo,
And 411 was free, seemed very fair!

But FCC wanted it seems,
To let others skim long-distance creams,
No matter 'bout the locals,
They're mostly all just yokels!

And so one day it came to pass,
That the great Bell System did collapse,
In rubble now, we all do mass,
The day... Bell System... died.

So bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
"Our local calls have us in hock!" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

I drove on out to Murray Hill,
To see Bell Labs, some time to kill,
But the sign there said the Labs were gone.
I went back to my old CO,
Where I'd had my phone lines, years ago,
But it was empty, dark, and ever so forlorn...

No relays pulsed,
No data crooned,
No MF tones did play their tunes,
There wasn't a word spoken,
All carrier paths were broken...

And so that's how it all occurred,
Microwave horns just nests for birds,
Everything became so absurd,
The day... Bell System... died.

So bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
"Our local calls have us in hock!" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

We were singing:

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
"Our local calls have us in hock!" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?

And it's good enough for me.        And that's good enough for me.

I was singing Hari Rama              We will pray with those Egyptians
With my friend the Dalai Lama        Build pyramids to put our crypts in

One-eyed Odin we will follow      We will pray to Zarathustra

Which is good enough for me!      And that's good enough for me!

Hare Krishna gets a laugh on         I'll arise at early mornin'

I'll sing some songs to Lilith,      Now Danae was sweet as flowers,

and She's always PMS-ish,            And that showed her Zeus' power
but She's good enough for me!        And that's good enough for me!       
 
And what about this Bacchus,         Diana is a little spikey
Who lives just to raise a ruckus?    And she is a little dyke-ey
Loosens women so they'll f*** us,    You don't have to be a Psych-e
Well, that's good enough for me!     To know that's right for me!

Lilith wears a lacy nightie        That Bob Larson shrieks and hollers
And She is a little flighty        Fighting demons in his callers
She will get you all excite-y      Save his program: SEND YOUR DOLLARS! 
She's wet-dream enough for me!     And that's good enough for me.

              IMPERIUM COMPOUND                                  
                      (Tune: "Lily the Pink")

   Now here's a story, a little bit gory,
   A little bit happy, a little bit sad.
   About a drink called Imperium Compound
   And how the SCA's been had!                       (1)

   Chorus: Oh we think, we think, we think,
           The King is a fink, a fink, a fink,
           A figure of respectability
           Rules the Kingdom thru Imperium Compound
           The results are plain to see!

   Duke Treegirtsea, was known for his courtesy,
   And his fighting prowess was well-renowned
   Took a thimble of Imperium Compound
   And the poor Duke nearly drowned!                  (2)

   Words with Andy, you never should bandy

   Meriwold, he's the bane of a Skald, he
   Has no attributes of which to sing
   Polite and formal, incredibly normal,

   A King's Crown could be done.
   Drank a little Imperium Compound
   And became the Aten King, first one!                     (5)
11
   There was Astra, no one ever asked her
   And she was for having fun!
   Then she sampled Imperium Compound,
   And today she is a nun   \\ not better!\\               (19)

   There's good old Igor, his prowess is meager
   For he never learned to water-ski!
   But instead he drinks Imperium Compound
   Then he howls and climbs a tree!  \\Hoo Hah!\\          (19)

   Then there's Dagan, his brother's the Ka-Khan,
   Which is quite funny in a King!
   If he gets hooked on Imperium Compound
   There'll be new songs to sing!    \\ Oh, really?\\       (19)  

   Fredrick of Holland, who dwells in the Northland,
   A Master from the West, he came!
   Spends all his money for Imperium Compound
   That's why his garb's always the same!                   (20)

   Now Gyrth Oldcastle, round as a beer barrel,
   Once chose to quarrel with a certain Bard;
   The poet served him with Imperium Compound,
   And left him rendered down to lard!                      (20)

   Many tales abound of Imperium Compound
   And its' strange effects on Royalty,
   But after an hour, this song has no power,
   And by now, it's boring ME!                             (16)

   Duchess Malinda, who doesn't do windas
   But she does a lot of Duchess Things,
   But give her a LOT of Imperium Compound,
   And she sings and sings and sings and sings and sings!   (5)

   AltChorus: Oh it's too long, too long, too long
              To sing the whole song, the song, the song
              Longer than a Royal Court, it is!
              But sing it serial, this ditty Imperial
              And you'll be a bardic whiz!                 (5)

                                             IMPERIUM COMPOUND    
                                             (Atenveldt Verses)

   Now here's a story, a little bit gory,
   A little bit happy, a little bit sad.
   About a drink called Imperium Compound
   And how the SCA's been had!                       

   Chorus: Oh we think, we think, we think,
           The King is a fink, a fink, a fink,
           A figure of respectability
           Rules the Kingdom thru Imperium Compound
           The results are plain to see!

   Mongol Hordemen, those free-living swordsmen
   Subverting the Kingdoms from underneath!
   Have no use for Imperium Compound
   Except perhaps to brush their teeth!

   AltChorus: Oh we fink, we fink, we fink,
              The Khan and the Kink, the Kink, the Kink,
              And the Board, their Great Senilities!
              The Western Irgun, drinks Imperium Compound
              And we're BACK, with results you'll see!    

   Lady Laurel, with Authority Royal,
   Passes and rejects our heraldry
   She needs a swig of Imperium Compound
   Then perhaps she'd deign to talk to me!            

   Lady Trude thought it her duty
   To turn a social wrong into a Right
   Proved her point with Imperium Compound
   And showed that Cheshire Cats can fight!  //and scratch//

   The Board of Directors styled themselves The Electors
   And another con they tried to swing
   Now the BoD drinks Imperium Compound
   So we no longer need a King!                        

   AltChorus: Oh the Bod, the BoD, the BoD,
              It thinks it is God, is God, is God,
              The figure of Supreme Authority!
              And if we O.D.'d on Imperium Compund
              there'd be no need for Royalty!          

   Oh, MEDIEVAL Net, we thought it was all wet
   With witty remarks, and other kinds of sass
   We'll feed our computers on Imperium Compound
   And BYTE the BoD right on its' righteous ass!         

   Good old Duncan was often drunken
   Chasing all the ladies fair
   He bathed himself in Imperium Compound
   Now he has a little savoir faire!                     

                    (more)


  ATEN IMPERIUM (cont.)

   Ioseph of Locksley, never changes his socks, he
   Runs around looking like a Cavalier,
   He stocked up on Imperium Compound
   And he has enough to last for years and years!        

   AltChorus: Oh they forgot, forgot, forgot
              The Locks-e-ly Plot, the Plot, the Plot!
              And it works the best when it is underground!
              It isn't a hassle for a green-and-white tassle
              They're the ones that BREW Imperium Compound!  

   Trelon of the Wood, he was very good, he
   Was a leader that had never been beat before;
   But Caid had Imperium Compound,
   And Imperial Roman Caid won the War!  //with help!//   

   In Tyr Ysgithr, it's regularly whispered there
   That the Kingdom is ruled over by a King    // What's THAT? //
   They're "democratic" and quite erratic....
   They've forgot the purpose of the whole damn thing!     

   King Sir Mark von, with his pretty white suit on,
   Rules the Kingdom both with Grace and Purity!
   He never touches Imperium Compound
   At least not where anyone else can see!               

   Duke Sir Deaton, was never beaten
   On the field, or in the drinking hall;
   At the Catbox War with Caid,
   Left thirty bodies piled against the wall!             

   Denis O'Titans was good at smitin'
   A Locksley Monster in every single way!
   Drank a little Imperium Compound
   And ATE Deaton's sword that day  // No! REALLY! //       

   Wotan the Mongoloid, a little bit paranoid,
   But a nice guy none the less;
   Drank a mess of Imperium Compound
   Now he's Justin du Roc, I confess!                       

   Then there's Duke Reynard, with a face like a St. Bernard
   Of the Dukes, he is the homliest
   He tends to toke up on Imperium Compound
   And go out and whomp on anybody's best!                   

   This song'll bedevil the folks at a revel,
   And most of the time it will annoy the King,
   So take a drink of Imperium Compound
   And let's go Royalty-bedeviling!                        

   Duchess Anna is quite a fan-a
   Going on a wartime shopping spree!  \\ War Point!\\
   Took a drink of Imperium Compound
   And shopped so fast we couldn't see! \\ Z-o-o-o-om!\\    (5)

                     (more)


  ATEN IMPERIUM (Cont.)

   Lyn of Whitewolfe, made of the right stuff,
   Twice the Queen of Atenveldt;
   Took a drink of Imperium Compound
   And the Kingdom of Caid before her knelt!              

   Duke Sir Brion, and Duke Sir Trelon,
   Won the Crown with regularity;
   Drank a lot of Imperium Compound,
   And founded a dynasty!                                 

   Stephan von Geist, was most awful nice,
   And a chivalrous fighter without any doubt
   Took a swig of Imperium Compound
   And won the Crown his first time out!                    

   All the Crusadenes were big, but not mean,
   And the finest fighters in the town.
   But they all drank Jerusalem Compound,
   Winning Crown after Crown after Crown!                 

   Good Duke Arthur couldn't get no farth-er
   A Norman King in Aten Land
   Drank too much of Imperium Compound
   And went off to conquer Engel-land!                    

   Then King Richard, a bit of a bitch, heard
   A King's Crown could be done.
   Drank a little Imperium Compound
   And became the Aten King, first one!                    

   Duchess Malinda, who doesn't do windas,
   But she does a lot of Duchess Things,
   But give her a LOT of Imperium Compound,
   And she sings and sings and sings and sings and sings!   

   Duke Sir Brion, with his pretty white suit on,
   Is a model of goodness and purity
   Never touches Imperium Compound
(spoken:) And I'll sell ya seashore property in Yuma, too!  

   Optional last verse:

   Many tales abound of Imperium Compound
   And its' strange effects on Royalty,
   But after an hour, this song has no power,
   And by now, it's boring ME!                            

   AltChorus: Oh it's too long, too long, too long
              To sing the whole song, the song, the song
              Longer than a Royal Court, it is!
              But sing it serial, this ditty Imperial
              And you'll be a bardic whiz!

                recorded: CELTIC CIRCLE DANCE
                          WTP-0002C

        Last night I had the strangest dream in this bleak century
        I dreamed that people the world around believed in Chivalry

        I dreamed I saw a Kingly Crown enshrined in laurel leaves
        with Grace and Joy and Purity attendant at his feet

        I dreamed I saw the perfect Knight receive his accolade
        and minstrels sang and children laughed in some soft forest glade

        I dreamed I saw the finest thing that ever man could make
        grow great and strong and undefiled: Pray God I never wake!

        Last night I had the strangest dream in this bleak century
        I dreamed that people the world around believed in Chivalry

               (to the tune of "Good King Wenceslaus")

                Locksley Monsters never yield
                on the field of battle
                strike the helm and bash the shield
                make their eyeteeth rattle
                Bodies on the ground will lie
                bones will burst in sunder
                search for Locksleys' enemies:
                You'll find them six feet under!

                              SONG OF IVANOF

            There is a man who we know well that does the best he can
            but he's displayed in armour made of reticulated garbage cans!

            He looks so fine and fair and strong, oh how he plays the man
            and how it's prized, those galvanized, reticulated garbage cans

            The noblest Roman of them all, a good Praetorian
            a combatant who wears no pants, judst reticulated garbage cans!

            Like old Horatius at the Bridge, like the Legions of Valerian
            (O dearie me: those LOVELY knees!)
            and those reticulated garbage cans!

                         C. McCray Bethancourt

         (sung to the tune (obviously) of the 12 Days of Christmas)


1.           The first time I sent my device, The Heralds said to me

            "It violates the Rule of Three"

2.           The next time I tried it, the Heralds said to me

            "We changed the forms, and it violates the Rule of
             Three".

3.           The third time I tried, and the Heralds said to me, 

            "We upped the fees, we changed the forms, and it
             violates the Rule of Three".

4.           Another time I tried and the Heralds said to me,
 
            "We haven't got it, we upped the fees, we changed the 
             forms, and it violates the Rule of Three".

5.           The fifth time I tried it, the Heralds said to me,  

            "In a decision rendered by the College of Arms on
             August 1st, A.S. V it was decided that this style of
             heraldic design was not appropriate to the aims and 
             intentions of the Corporate Body. Holy! Holy! Holy! "

 note: verse 5 is delivered in an extremely fast, mono-
       tone, similiar to a Gregorian Chant.

           " ....we haven't got it, we upped the fees, we changed the forms,
             and it violates the Rule of Three."

6.           I tried it a sixth time, and the Heralds said to me,

            "We changed the rules, &c"

7.           A seventh time I tried and, the Heralds said to me,

            "It's against the Rule of Tincture, we changed the
             rules, &c"

8.           I tried it once again and the heralds said to me,

            "It's not a Period design, It's against the Rule of Tincture, We
             changed the rules, &c"

                                * more *



    Heralds Said To Me (cont.)

9.           I sent it in once more, and the Heralds said to me,

            "We changed the rules again, It's not a Period design,
             it's against the Rule of Tincture, we changed the
             rules, &c"

10. (sung in cold anger)
             The LAST time I sent my device, the Heralds said to me

    (sung in a state of SMUG)
             "Someone else has got it, &c"




              (nb: every single one of these reasons has been used by the
              CoA, at one point or another, to reject perfectly good
              heraldry, along with some even MORE stupid.  If the shoe 
              fits....................!!!!!!!!)

                        BUGS ON THE BARONESS
                        Tune: Waltzing Matilda
 
           or: Who was that Vermin I saw you with last, Knight?
   or: There may be Lice on all you Knice, but there ain't no Lice on me

           Once there was a Barony howling in the wilderness
           nestled in the Valley where the River doesn't flow
           and the folks were driven buggy by the insects in the Revel Hall
           Authenticity is wonderful, but this doesn't go!

                   Bugs on the Baroness, bugs on the Baroness!
                   That was the cry that you heard all the day
                   and the scratching can be heard from Ysgithr to Ered Sul
                   why did we come here? Let's go away!

           See them all a scratching, nestled in their armour tight
           the fleas have a melee team that's challenging the field!
           call Truly Nolen! Someone's gotta help us out!
           the crabs are nesting in our helms but we'll never yield!

                   (chorus)

           Dawn comes a-breaking, the bugs have won the Coronet...
           flea-infested Conan-clones in piles upon the lawn
           where is the Barony? The bugs have eaten everyone...
           termites got the stick-jocks, and all their sticks are gone!

                   (chorus)

                          ATENVELDT
                          tune: The West's Awake

                  For all the Lands where I have dwelt
                  Oh Atenveldt, Oh Atenveldt
                  till rivers burn and mountains melt
                  lest I forget my Atenveldt
                  From deserts stark to snow-capped peaks
                  from silent lakes and laughing creeks
                  sing: Oh let man find his heart's ease
                  on rocky plains
                  in desert breeze

                  For oft I thought of mighty men
                  who carved a Land with sword and pen
                  and lit a candle, burning bright,
                  that pierced the darkness; stirred the night!
                  tho some are gone their deeds remain
                  this sunny Crown without a stain
                  sing: Oh, their deeds were not in vain!
                  in sunlit days
                  and falling rain.....

                  So raise your banners, blazoned bright
                  Advance the Dream and Shine the Light!
                  in battle's crash and Revel's song
                  raise high the Flag and wave it long!
                  For all the Lands wherein I've dwelt
                  I love you best, my Atenveldt!
                  Sing: Oh the Joy that I have felt!
                  My Atenveldt
                  My Atenveldt

      What the use of wearing panties
      whalebone corsets of your Auntie's
      boxer shorts and other scanties
      best of all is nude
      there's such fun in going bra-less
      now that it's no longer lawless
      'specially if your figure's flawless
      best of all is nude
      nude is what you're born in
      shirts are never torn in
      underwear and lacy flimsies, garter belts and other whimsies
      yards of itchy cloth to put your form in
      ducks all do it, maidens rue it
      even ancient Picts in Britain blue it
      going naked's how to do it
      best of all is nude!

      If your garters aren't elastic
      tie them up in knots fantastic
      (panty hose is something drastic!)
      best of all is nude!
      If you're tired of wearing clotheses
      shed your garment 'mongst the roses
      never mind the old bluenoses
      best of all is nude!
      Nude is best for ducking!
      Worst for horses bucking!
      Moonlit nights will see such sights
          that are very best for fooling round
                              .....and elbows!
      Nudity is grand to see
       a well-known antidote to virginity
      take your clothes off and you'll see:
      best of all is nude!

                   Hi said the Norn, sittin in the sand
                   once I talked to a great Grey Man
                   spun three times and said with a sigh
                   hadn't been for the Runes had his other eye!

                   Chorus: hi diddle i diddle i day

                   Hi said the Lady, dressed in green
                   prettiest thing I've ever seen
                   she went down underneath the hill
                   and came back out of her own free will

                   Brian Boru, on Irish ground
                   walked three times the Island round
                   Norsemen came lookin for a fight
                   just another Irish Saturday night!

                   Hi said Lugh on the banquest night
                   a poet and a player and a good wheelwright
                   a harper and a warrior and none the least:
                   a Druid and he got in to the Feast!

                   Harold Haardrada's face was red!
                   Came to Britain and he wound up dead
                   Stamford Bridge is where he's found
                   got six feet of English ground

                   the Legion with it's Eagles bright
                   marched into the Pictish night
                   met them there upon the sand
                   gave em up to the Wicker Man!

                   eight-legged steed and hound of Hel
                   the one-eyed Man, he loves ya well
                   fire burn and fire spark
                   are you then feared of the dark?

                   The Circle forms, the Circle flows
                   the Circle goes where no man knows
                   Hail to the Lady, one in three:
                   Present is Past and Past is Me!

                   Rhiannon's Birds are still in flight
                   all thru the Day all thru the Night
                   Hail to the Lady, one in Three
                   Present is Past and Past is Thee!

                   Celtic Circle Dance (cont.)

                   Hi said the Lady dressed in white
                   sang the Day and sang the Night
                   sang the Land and sang the Sea
                   sang the Song, and then sang Me!

                   (extra verses) Salt and oil and mirror bright
                                  fire and fleet and candlelight

                                  fill the cup and blessed be!

                                  From the misty crystal sea
                                  came the Lady to the lea
                                  Sword and Roses in Her Hand
                                  spread their seeds thruout the Land

                                  Came the Stag from oaken wood
                                  saw the Lady where she stood
                                  by the fire burning bright
                                  came to know his heart's delight!

                   Present is Past and Past is WE

                   By Oak and Ash and Holy Thorn
                   bledded be the Day you're born!

               Of those that Rule all Lands above

               When we were Sauvage, Fierce and Wilde
               they came as a Mother to her childe
               they gently raised us from the slime
               and kept our hands from Hellishe Crime
               and made us a Kingdom in their own good time

               Now, Atenveldt forgets the Past
               and thinks on a Day that's coming fast
               when we shall all be....civilized....(puke)
               neat, and clean.....and WELL-ADVISED
               oh won't the Directors be....suprised?!

        I thought all girls were beautiful and the sun was always shinin'

        Then one day, M'Lady came, and stopped the clocks from tickin'

                    WEAPONS AT THE DOOR

 Being a Polemic concerning the alleged Custom of the West Kingdom concerning 
 checking your Weapons at the Door of the Revel Hall. As the Satire is the 
 Weapon of the Bard, this said Polemic is to be checked at the Door, along with 
 swords, knives, redheaded Ladies and other such Deadly Things.....

         As I roved out to Western Lands to take the Western Air
         I went into a Revel Hall and I saw a Twelfth Night there
         but I was halted at the gate by a Privy Consellor
                 (that's the man who tells the King of the West how to go to
                  the bath room!)
         who told me I would have to check my Weapons at the door

         As I, in my astonishment, stood hung on tenter-pegs
         a Knight came in whose Prouess hung down between his legs
         the Doorman grabbed a greatsword and he struck the Knight full sore
         and gave him a reciept; he left his weapon at the door!

         a Bard was next whose goodly Voice has entertained us all
         but he, too, was prevented from entering the Hall
         and told he could not carry deadly weapons on the floor
         he left his Voice and Harp among the weapons at the door

         a Master entered graciously, a man we all know well
         who holds a 3rd Dan Black Belt, tho this he'd never tell
         the Master struggled valiantly, the Master cursed and swore
         but he left his hands, and feet, as weapons at the door

         the company was jovial, altho a bit dismayed
         for lack of proper cutlery, down to the smallest blade
         for even teeth and fingernails, each can be used in War
         were cut, and pulled, and left behind, as weapons at the door!

         And has their King not loyal Knights that He must be afraid
         of brawling in his Hall and of Assassin's bloody blade?
         the Rights of Men to carry Arms at least WE'VE not foreswore
         and a POX on them that made the Rule of Weapons at the Door!

                           THE STREETS OF ANN ARBOR

               As I walked out thru the streets of Ann Arbor
               as I walked out thru Ann Arbor one day
               I spied a young Mongol all dressed in white linen
               all dressed in white linen and cold as the clay

               I then spied another, done in on the sidewalk
               along with just about six dozen more
               their wounds were all gaping, from mace and from braoadsword
               from claymore and cannon, all dripping with gore

               what caused this grave carnage, I cried to the Monglos
               oh pray what's the reason for this awful sight
               my answer came slowly from under the corpse-pile
               "It seems that our bark is much worse than our bite....."

               the answer continued from pale lips a-shaking
               we sang all our songs and believed them as true
               the Dark Horde could never be beaten in battle
               we thought this was what all good Mongols could do...

               we went down to Atenveldt all for to plunder
               "too large to defend" was our song every night
               but Atenveldt's different from East, West or Middle
               there, even the bushes have learned how to bite!

               the Clann stole our ponies, the Scraelings our foodstuffs
               we ran into axes in AtenViking hands
               our maidens ran off with one Richard of Arkham
               and we're all that's left to return to our lands

               MacChluarains and Monsters, Lockehaven and Foxmoor
               that Kingdom is BIG and its' fighters are MEAN!
               we fought and we lost, and fled back to Ann Arbor
               we all came back home with results that you've seen

               keep away from that Land with its' cactus and marshes
               it's no place for Mongols who are bent on War
               they count their blows well, but they strick them yet better
               he crawled into his Yurt, and fell, dead, on the floor.....

       tune: the song of the Cowardly Lion, Tin Woodsman and Scarecrow
             in the movie version of the Wizard of Oz

        (Enter the Scarecrow, who singeth:)

        My wife is always nagging; my Prowess it is lagging
        I can't do anything
        she has got a reason, but revenge is out of season
        Oh I wish I could be King!

        If I just had the Crown on, I'd always have a frown on
        and the Barons on a string
        Heads they would be rolling, the Board would be cajoling
        Oh if only I was King!

        I am very fed up with the way this group is set up
        Oh I'd change everything!
        they are so high and mighty with the way that they do fight-ey
        Oh, someday I'll be King!

        Tho my wife is melancholic, and very...vitriolic
        she's a wasp without a sting!
        I'd have to supervise her with a pack of tranquilizers
        If I only was a King......

        (the Tin Woodsman joineth him, and singeth:)

        I grew up kind of cocky, and rather big, and stocky
        and straight as any rod
        on the field I'm a battallion, with the Ladies I'm a stallion
        ...Oh they'd better make me God!

        The other boys are jealous they say I'm over-zealous
        they'd do better to applaud
        the things that I am giving to this Dream that we are living
        oh I wish they'd make me God!

        They say that I'm conceited, but I'm just badly treated
        by people and by BoD
        just think of what they're missing by My Majesty dismissing
        Oh they'd better make me God!

        (the Cowardly Lion creepeth forth, and singeth:)

        Oh I could be a fighter, a great and mighty smiter
        and be the perfect knight
        it's a great and nasty shame, and everyone's to blame
        oh I wish that I could fight!

        Song of the Three (cont.)

        I could be a Cavalier drinking wine and ale and beer
        and be a gorgeous sight
        but it would cost me too much money so it isn't very funny
        oh I wish that I could fight!                               

        Let me at 'em on the field, I would surely make them yield
        to my Power and my Might
        with rattan, shinai and rapier they would nevermore escape here
        If they'd only let me fight

                  (2 - 3 - 4, tell the people what she wore!)

                  It was an itsy bitsy teeny weenie little rabbit fur bikini
                  That she wore, for the first time, that day.
                  An itsy bitsy teenie weenie little rabbit fur bikini
                  And in her apartment she wanted to stay!

                One day in the Kingdom of the Middle
                It happened at a Tourney one day:
                The Mongols invaded the Middle
                But the Middle did not want to play...

                  (eins - zwei - drei, but the Dark Horde wouldn't die!)

                  It was an itsy bitsy tiny teenie Nauseating Mongol weenie
                  That they saw, for the first time, that day.
                  An itsy bitsy tiny teenie Nauseating Mongol weenie
                  And the Mongols did NOT go away!

                Now the Heralds made up a new Rulebook
                And to read it is some kind of gas!
                It's a bureaucrat's dream, this new Rulebook
                Now NOBODY'S blazon can pass!

                  (Win - Place - Show, tell the Heralds where to go!)

                                 (insert Bronx cheer!)

                  I want an itsy bitsy teenie weenie little rabbit fur bikini
                  On my shield, as my blazon, today!
                  An itsy bitsy teenie weenie little rabbit fur bikini
                  But "that's offensive" the Heralds all say!

                I sat down at the Revel last evening
                To a feast of green meat, and Rat Pie...
                It was cold, and disgusting, and greasy
                And I just want to upchuck and die!

                  (6 - 7 - 8, tell them what was on your plate!)

                  It was an itsy bitsy teenie weenie little rabbit fur bikini
                  With a side dish of cold cabbage pie!
                  An itsy bitsy teenie weenie little rabbit fur bikini
                  With the fur on, and NOTHING inside!

                      by William Poundstone
                              1983

     Two mentalities are at work here: 1960s rock fans and 1980s
fundamentalist Christians. The idea of phonographically concealed
messages dates from the Paul McCartney death scare of 1969. For
hard-core types, the secret-message rumors never really died. Avid
rock fans have auditioned ever album release since the late 1960s
for hidden nuances. Backward messages, barely audible messages,
and messages on one stereo track only have been alleged. At the
other end of the sociosensual spectrum, fundamentalist Christians
have gotten into the act. TV programs such as PRAISE THE LORD and
THE 700 CLUB have propagated rumors of a satanic plot in the
recording industry, no less, in which various albums conceal
"backward-masked" demonic murmurings. If THAT sounds too spacey to
be taken seriously, consider that it was the fundamentalist groups
who were behind House Resolution 6363, a bill introduced in the
U.S. House of Representatives by Robert K. Dornan (R., Calif.) in
1982 to label all suspect records: "WARNING: THIS RECORD CONTAINS
BACKWARD MASKING THAT MAKES A VERBAL STATEMENT WHICH IS AUDIBLE
WHEN THIS RECORD IS PLAYED BACKWARD AND WHICH MAY BE PERCEPTIBLE
AT A SUBLIMINAL LEVEL WHEN THIS RECORD IS PLAYED FORWARD." In
February 1983, the Arkansas State Senate passed a similar record-
labeling bill by a vote of 86 to 0.
     Contributing to the quasi-occult status of these rumors is
the difficulty of checking them out on home audio equipment. You
pretty much have to take someone else's word for it, or dismiss
the rumors out of hand.
     From a technical standpoint, there are four simple ways to
conceal a verbal message on a recording. The most obvious is to
record the message at a very low volume. The message may then be
recovered by turning the volume up while playing the record or
tape. If the message is faint enough, though, noise levels of home
equipment may garble it. If the accompanying music or lyrics are
loud enough, or if the message itself is indistinct or
electronically modified, it may be hard to hear on any equipment.
     A second gimmick is to record a message on one stereo track
only. Records and tapes have two independent recordings, of
course, normally played simultaneously for stereo effect. On a
record, each stereo track occupies on one side of the V-shaped
groove for the needle. On a tape, the tracks are recorded in
parallel lanes of the magnetic material. The two tracks are called
"right" and "left" after the stereo speakers they will play on.
Otherwise, the tracks are interchangeable -- the sound mixer can
put anything he or she wants on each track. A message on one track
can be masked by simultaneous loud music or lyrics on the opposite
track. With normal stereo balance (or mono equipment) the loud
track drowns out the message track. At home, single-track messages
can be recovered by adjusting the stereo balance so that only the
desired track plays. Sometimes this trick also makes indistinct
words clearer. Even if the words are not exclusively on one track,
they may happen to be more audible on one track.
     A message could be recorded at a speed different from the
rest of the record. Then the record would have to be played faster
or slower than usual to recover the message. Unless the message
was at one of the standard speeds (say, 45 rpm on a 33 1/3 rpm
record), it could not be played normally on home equipment.
     The fourth and most commonly alleged trick is to record a
verbal message backward. Reversed speech has several unexpected
features. One is that syllables are not a constant in the reversal
process. A one-syllable word can have two or three syllables when
played backward. Thus "number nine" in the Beatles' REVOLUTION 9
reverses to "Turn me on, dead man" (or something like it), a jump
from three to five syllables.
     There is no simple way to predict what a word or phrase will
sound like reversed. Obviously, you can't just reverse the
letters.
     Reversed messages are difficult to recover at home. Record
turntables are not built to go backwards. Some have a neutral
setting, in which the pickup and amplifier remain active and you
can turn the record backward by hand. But hardly anyone has a
stead enough hand to produce satisfactory results.
     With patience, it is possible to reverse a cassette
recording. Transfer the music from the original record or tape
onto a blank tape cassette. Place the cassette flat on a table.
Draw our the part of the tape with the suspected message and snip
it off at both ends. Hold the tape segment horizontally. Rotate it
180 degrees, keep it horizontal at all times. This turns the tape
end for end. Splice the reversed tape segment back onto the two
loose ends of the cassette with strong adhesive tape. Reel the
tape back inside the cassette. The sliced segment will play
backward on an ordinary cassette player.
     I rented a recording studio to test the secret-message
rumors. New copiies of the records in question were transcribed on
a quarter-inch master tape. Where rumor alleged that a single
stereo track contained a message, right and left stereo tracks
were transcribed separately. Records with alleged inaudible
messages were treated similarly. To test claims of reversed
messages, recordings on the master tape were edited out and
spliced in backward. Twenty cuts or portions of cuts from sixteen
albums were tested.


"Another One Bites the Dust"
Queen, THE GAME

Rumor: When played backward, the lyrics say, "It's fun to smoke
marijuana."
Findings: There is something that sounds like "It's fun to smoke
marijuana" in the reversed music. It is repeated over and over. It
might be rendered no less faithfully, however, as "sfun to scout
mare wanna." This "message" is the reversal of the song title,
which is repeated as a line in the song.
     Let's make a distinction between engineered and phonetic
reversals. When an artist records a verbal statement, reverses it
by turning the tape end for end, mixes the reversed statement onto
a master tape, and has records and tapes produced from the master,
that is an engineered reversal. When the phonetic properties of
song lyrics are such that they can be reversed to sound like
something else, that is a phonetic reversal.
     "It's fun to smoke marijuna" is clearly a phonetic reversal.
The lyrics are perfectly plain played forward ("Another one bites
the dust"), no so plain played backward ("sfun to scout mare
wanna"). With an engineered reversal, the opposite should hold
true: gibberish forward, clear as a bell backward. Some are
prepared to believe that phonetic reversals are just as
intentional as engineered reversals -- that the songwriter
painstakinginly planned the phonetic double-entendre. In the
absence of confirming evidence, that just doesn't wash. It's too
easy to find coincidences. If, for example, the letters of the
alphabet are recited in conventional fashion (Ay, Bee, Cee, etc.)
and reversed, at least five sound like English language words. D
reverses to "eden," F becomes "pray," S becomes "say," V becomes
"even," and Z becomes "easy." "It's fun to smoke marijuana" is
likewise a coincidence.


"A Child is Coming"
Jefferson Starship, BLOWS AGAINST THE EMPIRE

Rumor: When played backward, "son of Satan."
Findings: Another phonetic coincidence. The repeated "It's getting
better" reverses to an iffy "son of Satan," the "of" drawn out and
the "Satan" strongly accented on the first syllable.


"Eldorado"
Electric Light Orchestra, ELDORADO

Rumor: When played backward, "He is the nasty one/ Christ, you're
infernal/ It is said we're dead men/ Everyone who has the mark
will live."
Findings: Coincidence. The supposed message lurks around the line
"On a voyage of no return to see." Reversed, this passage becomes
the expected syllable salad -- no one hearing it would describe it
as anything but reversed music. Only if you listen while reading
along with what you're supposed to hear will you get anything. The
rumored version of the message is somewhat fudged. The passage
sounds more like "He's to nasty one/ Christ you are, Christ,
you're fernal/ There wiss uh, we're dead men..." There is no "in"
in what is taken to be "infernal." The line that is supposed to be
"Everyone who has the mark will live" isn't even close, though the
syllable count is right.


"Shoo Be Doo"
The Cars, CANDY-O

Rumor: When played backward, the word "Satan" repeated
approximately eleven times.
Findings: Coincidence. The rumor refers to the reversal of the "Shoo
be doo, shoo be doo, shoo be doo..." near the end of the song. Given
the mysterious logic of reversed phonemes, these three-syllable units
can be hard as a repeated two-syllable word. The word sounds a little
like "Satan."


"Snowblind"
Styx, PARADISE THEATER

Rumor: According to a mimeographed list of suspect records distributed
by Congressman Dornan, the words "Satan move through our voices" when
played backwards.
Findings: Negative. Despite repeated listenings, it was not even
possible to identify the part of the reversed track that Dornan et al.
are talking about.


"Stairway to Heaven"
Led Zeppelin, untitled, a.k.a. STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN

Rumor: In reverse, "I live for Satan... The Lord turns me off...
There's no escaping it... Here's to my sweet Satan... There's power in
Satan... He will give you 666."
Findings: Coincidence. If you listen very carefully to the "And it
makes me wonder" lines in reverse, you'll hear something approaching
"There's no escaping it." A better description is "There's no escape
do." Knock of the last syllable, and you have "There's no escape," a
complete, intelligible sentence in reverse. It's there, all right, but
it's not an unlikely enough coincidence to -- well, make you wonder.
      The "Satan" in "I live for Satan" is good and clear. The "I live
for" part isn't. The other alleged lines are unremarkable. All are
phonetic reversals of the entirely lucid forward lyrics and obviously
just accidents.


"When Electricity Came to Arkansas"
Black Oak Arkansas, BLACK OAK ARKANSAS and RONCH AND ROLL

Rumor: In reverse, "Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan. He is God. He
is God."
Findings: The BLACK OAK ARKANSAS cut was reversed. Again, pairs of
reversed syllables are being freely interpreted as "Satan." "He is
God" was not identifiable.


"Rain"
The Beatles, HEY JUDE

Rumor: Unintelligible lyrics at the end are reversed.
Findings: A true engineered reversal and not really a secret. "Rain"
seems to have been the first popular recording to incorporate an
obviously reversed lyric. The story is that John Lennon accidentally
spliced the last part of the song in backward and liked the effect.
When reversed, the strange-sounding vocals at the end become
intelligible as a reprise starting with the drawn-out word
"sunshine."
      The reversal is less apparent to the casual listener than it
might be because the accompanying music is not reversed. The ending
fits in smoothly with the rest of the song, the vocals suggesting a
foreign language.


"Fire on High"
Electric Light Orchestra, FACE THE MUSIC

Rumor: When played backward, "The music is reversible, but time --
turn back!"
Findings: "Fire on High" is instrumental. About twenty-six seconds
into the music, scrambled speech is heard. It is mostly louder than
the accompanying music and begins with a two-syllable unit repeated
several times. The seeming speech lasts for about fourteen seconds.
      Reversing the music confirms that there is a true, engineered
message. In reverse, a voice (Jeff Lynne's?) says, "The music is
reversible, but time -- turn back! Turn back! Turn back! Turn back!"
All the words are clear and unambiguous. Anyone comparing this to the
alleged reversal on ELO's "Eldorado" will have no trouble telling
which is genuine.


"Goodbye Blue Sky"
Pink Floyd, THE WALL

Rumor: In reverse, "You have discovered the secret message."
Findings: The "secret message" is at the very end of the instrumental
passage following the "Goodbye Blue Sky" vocals. It comes just before
the words "What shall we do" at the start of the song that is
identified as "Empty Spaces" on the record label and as "What shall we
do now?" on the record sleeve. Played forward, the message is less
apparent than the FACE THE MUSIC reversal: A reasonably attentive
listener might play THE WALL through and not catch it. It suggests
speech not quite close enough to be overheard. In context this is not
unusual because the "Goodbye Blue Sky" instrumental passage includes
"airport noises" and other sound effects. A loud climax in the music
further masks the unintelligible voice.
      When played backward, the voice (Roger Waters?) plainly intones,
"Congratulations, you have just discovered the secret message. Please
send your answer to old Pink, care of the funny farm..." As the voice
fades out, there may be another word -- perhaps "Chalfonte or
"Chelsea" -- after "funny farm."


"Heavy Metal Poisoning"
Styx, KILROY WAS HERE

Rumor: A red sticker on the KILROY WAS HERE cover warns, "By order of
the Majority for Musical Morality, this album contains secret backward
messages..."
Findings: This is a case of second-generation backward-masking. Styx'
PARADISE THEATER did not contain a backward message, though a lot of
people said it did. So Styx has included a sure enough backward
message on KILROY WAS HERE. It is at the very beginning of "Heavy
Metal Poisoning." The reversed speech last about three seconds. There
is no musical background. The words reverse to "Annuit coeptis. Novus
ordo seclorum." This is the Latin motto encircling the pyramid on the
back of a dollar bill. The usual translation: "God has favored our
undertakings. A new order of the ages."
      The cover sticker's "Majority for Musical Morality" is a
fictitious Falwellesque group in the KILROY WAS HERE video. Although
the sticker suggests a plurality of "messages," only one was found.


Space between "I'm So Tired" and "Blackbird"
The Beatles, untitled, a.k.a. THE WHITE ALBUM

Rumor: A reversed message. At the time of the Paul-is-dead stories,
the segue from "I'm So Tired" to "Blackbird" was offered as evidence.
It was held to contain John Lennon's voice, reveresed, saying "Paul is
dead, miss him, miss him, miss him." That interpretation seems
unlikely now, but there is a mysterious low muttering between the
songs.
Findings: The mumbling is actually just to the "I'm So Tired" side of
the shiny "space" between cuts on the record. Each of the stereo
tracks was recorded separately, twice, and a copy of each track was
reversed. This produced four versions of the two-second passage: right
forward, left forward, right reversed, and left reversed. All were
equally unintelligible. It was not even apparent whether the voice is
forward or reversed. Nor could John Lennon be identified as the
speaker. There are nine or ten syllables. The first six (when played
forward) are a two-syllable unit repeated three times. There is little
or no difference betwen the stereo tracks. Any claimed interpretation
of the sounds seems doubtful.


"Strawberry Fields Forever"
The Beatles, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR

Rumor: It was, of course, claimed that John Lennon says "I buried
Paul" at the end. (It's forward, at the very end after the music
fades to complete silence, returns, and starts to fade out again.)
But Lennon told ROLLING STONE that the words are "cranberry
sauce."
Findings: They are "cranberry sauce." The "sauce"/"Paul" part is
indistinct, but the first syllable sounds a lot more like "cran"
than "I."


"Baby You're a Rich Man"
The Beatles, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR

Rumor: On one of the tracks the line "Baby you're a rich man too"
is sung as "Baby you're a rich fag Jew," a dig at Brian Epstein.
Or some think it's "rich fat Jew" and claim it as evidence of
Beatle anti-Semitism.
Findings: Negative. The two stereo tracks are nearly identical.
It's always possible to hear words as similar-sounding words, but
basically, the lyrics jibe with the published version.


"Revolution 9"
The Beatles, untitled, a.k.a. THE WHITE ALBUM

Rumor: Various reversed and/or one-track speech. The reversal of
"Number nine" to "Turn me on, dead man" has pretty much been
discounted as coincidence (though it appears on Congressman
Dornan's list).
Findings: Distinction between lyrics and any hidden message blurs
on "Revolution 9." The eight-minute cut is a montage of sounds
collected by John Lennon and Yoko Ono. It includes discordant
music, radio broadcasts, sirens, applause, gunfights, sports
cheers, the crackling of a fire, screams, a baby gurgling, a choir
singing, and much that cannot be identified. For this
investigation, "Revolution 9" was transcribed four times, twice on
each stereo channel. One copy of each of the tracks was reversed.
The four resulting versions were compared with each other and
against the original two-channel version.
     "Revolution 9" contains a lot of talking. Played in stereo,
forward, the longest stretch of understandable speech is probably
an announcer saying, "...every one of them knew that as time went
by they'd get a little bit older and a little bit slower..."
     One believable instance of reversed speech occurs: someone
saying "Let me out! Let me out!" (once held to represent McCartney
in his totaled Aston-Martin). Two iffy reversals occur on the
backward recording of the right stereo track:"She used to be
assistant" and "There were two men..." Neither is clear enough or
long enough to be convincing. Some of the music, including the
recurring theme, sounds more natural in reverse.
     "Turn me on, dead man" is a typical phonetic reversal. The
forward "number nine" (repeated throughout the cut) is clear; the
reversal is slurred -- something like "turn me on dedmun." It has
been claimed that "number nine" must be pronounced with a British
accent or with some careful inflection in order to reverse to
"Turn me on, dead man." This seems not to be so. As an experiment,
three American-accent renderings of "number nine" were reversed.
All sound about as much like "Turn me on, dead man" as the record
did. Like the other phonetic reversals, "Turn me on, dead man"
must be considered a coincidence.
     Much of "Revolution 9" is on one stereo track only. Near the
end a voice says "A fine natural imbalance...the Watusi...the
twist...Eldorado...Eldorado." "A fine natural imbalance" is on the
right track only, though the words that follow are in stereo. One
of the longer bits of speech -- "Who could tell what he was
saying? His voice was low and his [unintelligible] was high and
his eyes were low" -- is clear on the left track, a bare whisper
on the right.
     There is a stereophonically concealed "secret message" on
"Revolution 9." The words are on the right track. They begin about
four minutes, fifty-eight seconds into the cut and run for about
twenty-two seconds. They are not likely to be noticed in stereo
because of the much louder left track. The sound of applause
begins on the left track at about five minutes, one second into
the cut. Deafening noises -- the clapping, sirens, music --
continue on the left track until five minutes, forty seconds. It
may or may not have been Lennon's and Ono's intention to conceal
the spoken passage. Given the haphazard quality of "Revolution 9,"
the concealment may have been accidental. To recover the passage,
the left track must be switched off. The right track can then be
heard to contain a sound like a stopwatch ticking, behind these
words:

     So the wife called, and we better go to see a
     surgeon....[A SCREAM MUFFLES A LINE THAT SOUNDS LIKE
     Well, what with the prices, the prices have snowballed,
     no wonder it's closed.] ...So any and all, we went to
     see the dentist instead, who gave him a pair of teeth,
     which wasn't any good at all. So instead of that he
     joined the bloody navy and went to sea.
                      by William Poundstone
                              1986

     There really are backward messages on rock albums. And the
controversy over "backward masking" and "porn rock" has inspired a
whole new spate of messages. There may have been more genuine
backward messages in the past few years than ever before.
     The backward message controversy is usually traced to the
1960s and John Lennon's avant-garde sound mixing on such tracks as
"Revolution 9" on the Beatles' WHITE ALBUM. Lennon probably wasn't
trying to conceal a message so much as create an interesting
sound.
     The matter might have ended right there had it not been for
the Paul McCartney death rumor. College kids tried playing Beatles
records forward, backward, and at various speeds to find "clues"
to McCartney's fate. In the process they found snippets of speech
from Lennon's experiments. Even after McCartney was found safe and
sound in Scotland, some listeners continued to look for hidden
messages.
     Somehow, fundamentalist Christian groups became convinced
(ca. 1982) that the alleged messages were commercials for devil
worship. Not a single indisputable satanic message has turned up,
but there were scattered attempts to ban or label certain albums.
In 1986 one fundamentalist group announced that the theme song for
the old MR. ED TV show contains the word "Satan" when played
backward.)
     Ironically, the publicity accorded nonexistent messages has
inspired several artists -- among them porn rock hearing witness
Frank Zappa -- to hide real background messages in their music.
It's easy to do.
     The performer speaks or sings the message normally, then
reverses the tape, which is mixed into the soundtrack. This is all
accomplished simply enough at any recording studio.
     What's not so simple is playing it back. More home record,
cassette, and compact disk players won't play backward. You can
turn a record backward with a pencil eraser, but it's not good for
the needle or the turntable. The only way to reproduce the message
with full fidelity is to use a professional-quality reel-to-reel
tape player and splice the tape in backward.
     We used the facilities of KLOS radio in Los Angeles to
reverse some recent records containing true backward messages.


"Secret Messages"
Electric Light Orchestra, SECRET MESSAGES

ELO's ELDORADO album was among those alleged to contain satanic
backward masked messages. A patient listening to ELDORADO played
backward reveals no such messages. You hear only what you ought to
hear -- the reversed lyrics of the songs, which sound nothing like
the "messages" claimed to be there. In the wake of such
allegations, ELO did put an (innocuous) backward message on their
FACE THE MUSIC album. Perhaps they thought this would show how
silly the allegations were. Instead, the backward-masking people
seized on this as proof that the other "messages" were real. In
the latest volley, ELO has named an album after the controversy.
     In Britain (where the backward-masking issue is viewed as an
American eccentricity), the cover of SECRET MESSAGES has a mock
warning label to youth about the hidden label. Word of the albums'
impending release in the United States caused enough of a furor to
chill CBS Records into deleting the cover blurb.
     The reversed message is easy to find. It's at the beginning
of the first song, which is itself called "Secret Messages." You
can hear reversed speech when you play the record normally. A
voice intones "secret messages" -- forward -- in the middle of the
reversed speech, lest anyone dare be so unhip as to not know
what's going on.
     We transferred a new copy of SECRET MESSAGES to reel-to-reel
tapes and played it backward. The backward message goes: "WELCOME
TO THE BIG SHOW/ WELCOME TO THE BIG SHOW."
     That's it.


"Ya Hozna"
Frank Zappa, THEM OR US

"Ya Hozna," a six-minute composition on the first record of the
THEM OR US double album, is ENTIRELY backward. The albums' inner
cover, which includes lyrics for the other songs, says, "backwards
vocal -- you figure it out" of this cut. It credits Frank and Moon
Zappa, George Duke, and Napoleon Murphy Brock as vocalists.
     Played forward, "Ya Howza" sounds like a record played
backward -- reasonably so. The vocals are prominent and
unintelligible. Moon Zappa's voice is curiously recognizable, even
in reverse. It is hard to tell whether the music was recorded
forward or backward.
     When "Ya Howza" is played in reverse, you discover that the
music is virtually a palindrome -- it sounds about the same
forward and backward. The voices are all backward. In some cases
they have been modified electronically. Many of the words are
muffled. Even after repeated careful listening on both stereo
tracks, it is difficult to make out many of the lyrics. It doesn't
help that some of the words seem to be stream-of-consciousness
nonsense. Some of the unintelligible stuff sounds like opera.
     Starting at the beginning of the reversed tape -- the end of
the forward tape -- the clearer vocals go like this: "I am the
heaven, I am the water." This is in a hymnlike register. "You are
a lonely little girl./ But your mommy and your daddy hold you." A
singsong synthesizer voice.
     The most interesting part of the lyrics is an intermittently
orgasmic rap in Moon Zappa's Valley Girl voice. There are three
short monologues:

I'm like green!
I'm like squat!
I'm like soul!
Repeat, like soul!
I'm like pull, push,
Okay, like slow, slow.

You're never too old
Like slow, like slow, like slow
Okay, I like it.


All right, faster, faster,
Go, do it, do it twice,
Yeah, that feels good,
I'm looking great,
Yeah, fer shure!
Like, no way!


"No Anchovies, Please"
J. Geils Band, LOVE STINKS

"No Anchovies, Please" is a novelty song, really a narration with
sound effects, about a woman who is kidnapped after eating
anchovies. She is taken to a "foreign-speaking" country. The sound
effect of the foreign tongue seems reversed. When you do play it
in reverse, it becomes: "It doesn't take a genius to know the
difference between chicken shit and chicken salad."


"Darling Nikki"
Prince, PURPLE RAIN

"Darling Nikki," cited as porn rock before Congress, is about a
dominatrix in a hotel lobby masturbating with a magazine. In part,
the complaint was that the album cover (flowers, and Prince on a
motorcycle) wasn't explicit enough to warn kids of the suggestive
lyrics. Senator Paula Hawkins apparently was not aware of a
backward message hidden in "Darling Nikki." The last thirty-five
seconds of the song is gibberish. The music changes abruptly and
becomes a repeated glottal sound. Then a two-syllable sound is
repeated twice, something like "heaven, heaven." Unintelligible
speech follows. At the end is a sound reminiscent of rain or bacon
frying , and wind sounds.
     Played backward, the message becomes:

     Hello, how are you?
     I'm fine 'cause I know that the Lord is coming soon.
     Coming, coming soon.

     It is clearly Prince and the Revolution singing this. The
words are clear but the intonation is funny -- the linger on some
words. Perhaps this is to make the reversed message you hear
playing the record normally a little less conspicuous.
     This is a weird reversal of the supposed secret message
menace. Raunchy forward lyrics conceal a religious secret message.


"Judas Kiss"
Petra, MORE POWER TO YOU

Petra is an obscure group that sings religious songs to a rock
beat. As further proof that things have gone full circle, the
backward-masking controversy prompted Petra to include a wholesome
backward message on their MORE POWER TO YOU album. It is in the
transition between two songs, just before "Judas Kiss." Clearly
audible gibberish reverses to this (the husky voice a cross
between George Beverly Shea and Dee Snider): "What are you looking
for the Devil for, when you ought to be looking for the Lord?"

AFL JoyceM Welcome to the Apple II Music & Sound chat - our discussion will
           be on NoiseTracker - the new FTA music program for the GS.  AFA
           Gene will be our host this evening...Gene, the floor is yours :)

AFA Gene   Hi all... well first I'd like to point out, if y'all aren't aware
           yet, that a spanking new version of NoiseTracker has recently
           been released (9 days ago) and is now available in our New Files
           library. It is version 0.5. I haven't played around with it much
           yet, but it's supposed to fix a lot of the little bugs in 0.3
           (the first version we had online).  NoiseTracker also includes
           the ability to directly import "modules," a term used for a
           certain type of Amiga song file which has become popular among PC
           users using the SoundBlaster sound card.

           Now, via NT, these "MOD" files are accessible by the GS. We
           expect to see a lot of activity on this end as far as ports from
           the PC and Amiga go. Note that you should be able to go straight
           to the PC music forum and download any recently uploaded MOD
           songfiles (there was a bug in the first wide release of the PCAO
           software, however, so a bunch of files with dates between around
           March 1991 and September 1991 may not download properly. Note that
           to use these PC MOD files, you'll have to rename the downloaded
           file "MOD.xxxxxx" if you want it to show up automatically in NT's
           "open" dialog box. (On the PC, all MOD files are named
           "xxxxxxxx.MOD" instead.)   Also, if the files are packed with ZIP
           compression, you'll need a program from the Communications Forum
           called AGATE -- it's a terminal program that includes the ability
           to unpack ZIP files.

           Now, I guess the best thing to do would be to talk about our
           favorite songfiles... there have been a few complaints, in fact,
           that people were not being "descriptive" enough in their file
           descriptions for uploads in describing the songs.

AFC Eddie  ?

AFA Gene   GA ed

AFC Eddie  Once a MOD file is unpacked with Agate, is a file type change
           needed?

AFA Gene   Nope, since all that NT looks for is the "MOD." being the first
           four characters in the filename.

AFC Eddie  OK, Thanks!

Deanna7332 Question...

JonL7      Can you list some of the features of Noisetracker?

AFA Gene   (you don't even need that "MOD." if you want to type the name in
           directly.)

Deanna7332 Did any of these mod files have anything to do with FTA's "Module
           A"

AFA Gene   Sure Jon, right after we answer Deanna's question. Deanna, you
           mean "Modulae?"

Deanna7332 Yes, that's it.

AFA Gene   Modulae was a demo written by FTA last year. (i'll get to you in a
           sec Doors).  It used SoundSmith v0.95 for all it's music. There
           is no connection between MOD files and Modulae by FTA.

Deanna7332 Throughout the demo it said "Loading modules"

AFA Gene   Those "modules" are not the same as Amiga soundfile "modules" --
           you see, what Modulae really was was a "stringing together" of a
           bunch of neat little tiny demos that FTA had written. So they
           called each little demo a "module" and thus the entire demo as a
           whole, "Modulae" (fancy plural of module?)

Deanna7332 Ok I understand.  Thank you. :)

AFL JoyceM Latin, Gene :)

AFA Gene   The term "MODule" from the Amiga comes from the idea that all the
           stuff needed to play the songfile (all the instruments + the
           sequence file) are included into one file, the "module."

TheDoors1  Gene, I have tried to d/l some recent uploaded MODs in the PC
           music area and still the problem exists.

AFA Gene   As I understand it, the problem was fixed VERY recently (correct
           me on this Joyce) and files uploaded as recently as early
           November still might not work depending on the version of the
           PCAO software that the uploader used.

AFL JoyceM Actually, Gene...I was under the impression that it had been, but
           if Doors is still having a problem, then it must not be fixed.

AFA Gene   What date was the file you tried to d/l, Door?

TheDoors1  umm 11/17, around there

AFA Gene   hmmm.... well i can tell you one thing... if it didn't work, don't
           waste your time again later... the problem is in the Apple
           software's method of d/lling files, and there are no plans to
           upgrade the Apple AO software.

AFL JoyceM I will endeavor to get an answer to that PC downloading
           problem/question :)

ThomasK63  i have a quick question... what can you use to unpack amiga mod
           files? On the PC side, that is.

TheDoors1  Agate Thomas

ELECTMUSIC Doors... what happens on after downloading..

Deanna7332 If it's LZHed you can't unless you have an IBM or
           PC/Transporter.

AFA Gene   If GS-ShrinkIt doesn't have that ability, i don't think there
           exists any such utility on the GS.

TheDoors1  What do you mean Elect?

ELECTMUSIC After you download the file... where do you encounter a problem?

TheDoors1  ok, you know when you download the file and at some point in the
           download the file starts to appear on your screen.  That's when I
           cancel it.

ThomasK63  I am sure soething good can be made w/out resorting to Amiga
           files

AFC Eddie  Yes, Doors, I believe the problem is with the PC software it was
           UL'd with.

TheDoors1  yeah Eddie.

GNO Tim    Amiga MOD files are typically compressed using LHarc.  I've
           uncompressed several on my Unix machine at school.

ThomasK63  good time for someone to make a lharc unpacker...

AFC DYAJim someone might be ;)

GNO Tim    Several people are already

AFC Eddie  Can't wait, Jim!

AFA Gene   Jon, did you have a question?

JonL7      The features of Noisetracker :)

AFA Gene   Oh yes... okay, here goes, in a nutshell, from most important to
           least:


AFA Gene   *  ability to import MOD files

           *  ability to import Soundsmith files

           *  ProDOS 8 based

           *  virtually no editing abilities (not a feature but important to
           know)

AFC DYAJim :)

AFA Gene   *  forgot: and the most important feature of all, the ability to
           hold instrument files in regular system RAM instead of DOC RAM,
           allowing for instruments far beyond the regular 64K limit found
           in ALL other GS music programs.

ThomasK63  I'll buy that!

TheDoors1  I have another question...when you're ready.

AFA Gene   GA Doors

TheDoors1  ok..is it true that NoiseTracker will take in soundsmith files and
           play them more clearly

AFA Gene   Well, as far as "what you hear," yes there is a definite
           difference with some instruments. It does NOT play the sounds
           more "clearly," but it just plays them in a different way. What
           many people seem to like about this "different way" is that
           sustained instruments (i.e. instruments designed to be played
           in a loop to simulate a long held note) seem to work better (or
           perhaps simply the way they were originally intended to work).

TheDoors1  I see

Deanna7332 Which takes up more space - MOD or NT  w/soundfile ?

AFA Gene   Deanna, it depends a few things, such as how big the sequence is,
           how many instruments you have, etc. Once you have a lot of
           assorted files, it'll probably average out to be about the same
           give or take a hundred blocks on your HD. So it basically depends
           on whether you prefer to have your instruments separate or not.

Deanna7332 Does playing quality differ with either one ?

AFA Gene   Nope. It's exactly the same either way. Loading time is the same
           too.

AFC Eddie  Can NT save songs as MOD files?

AFA Gene   Nope. It has options for Open and Close module, but these are
           still inactive.

AFA Gene   If there are no more questions, I'd like to talk about which NT
           files out there are the "hottest," since this info could be
           useful to many users who are interested in downloading NT/MOD
           files.

           My personal favorite is "Lambada," which is supplied by FTA with
           the program but is available separately on America
           Online.Everything about this file is really impressive except
           perhaps the sound quality of the horn-ish melody instrument.

           What about y'all, what are your favorite NT files?

AFL JoyceM Gene, there is a classical song for NT, but can't remember the
           name, but it is good.

AFC Eddie  I like Dragnet!

ELECTMUSIC So do I Ed

TheDoors1  I like Seven something

Deanna7332 My most favorite of all mod files is Pleasure Principle

AFC Eddie  <--appreciate's Greg's taste!

AFL JoyceM :)

AFA Gene   Deanna, i assume you got that from a local board?

Deanna7332 I got it from the PC forum here.

TheDoors1  I saw it there also

Deanna7332 I think under "Pleasure"

AFA Gene   Would you be able to upload it here? If it's really that good, we
           ought to have it available directly in our oun NT lib here (BTW
           folks, we will be releasing a new NoiseTracker software library
           soon!)

AFC Eddie  What a Forum!!!

Deanna7332 That sounds great!

AFL JoyceM Gene, do you think it will be possible for synthLAB files to be
           converted to MOD files?

AFL JoyceM MOD files?

AFA Gene   I doubt it, Joyce. The formats are so diametrically opposed in
           their entire basis of their file formats that it wouldn't be
           worth the time for a programmer to develop such a convertor.

Deanna7332 Isn't it possible to move the mod file from the PC forum to our
           music library?

AFA Gene   But..... it might be worth the time for a MIDI File Format to MOD
           convertor, since these two formats are more widely accepted.

Nuzz       they have nothing better to do Gene

ELECTMUSIC Gene.. some interesting similarities with DTune and NTracker

AFA Gene   They lose the file, tho, Deanna. :)

AFL JoyceM In what way, Greg?

ELECTMUSIC Both Prodos 8

Deanna7332 Shhh they won't know a thing :)

ELECTMUSIC I also believe Bill uses a shuttling of sound data between Doc
           Ram and Ram.

AFC Eddie  Interesting, Greg.

ELECTMUSIC Thats how he gets some of the excellent instrument quality

AFC Eddie  But Diversitune has that one distinction:  MIDI input.

AFL JoyceM Deanna, we would greatly appreciate it if you would upload that
           'Pleasure' song to our library :)

ELECTMUSIC Agreed Ed.. one of the factors FTA doesn't like to incorporate
           into their programs.

Deanna7332 I'll u/l it tonight if possible.

AFL JoyceM Thanks :)

AFC Eddie  Thanks, Deanna!

AFL JoyceM I will send Bill B a copy of NoiseTracker + some MOD files...to
           see what comments we get from him (will send when I get back).

AFC DYAJim What ever happened to that diversitune upgrade that was talked
           about ?

ELECTMUSIC That would be interesting Joyce

AFC Eddie  Bill apparently still working on it, Jim.

ELECTMUSIC I am sure he would appreciate the Prodos 8

AFC DYAJim good..

AFL JoyceM Jim...RSN....he was hoping by Christmas (this year), but he is
           soooo busy with his job, who knows?

AFC DYAJim Oh yeah, I noticed the speed calcuation in NT .5 is inaccurate
           :)

AFC DYAJim I recall he has set a lot of Christmas projected dates :)

ELECTMUSIC He was one of the first "Free Tools" experts in breaking all the
           rules for economic sake.

AFC DYAJim like for the vaporware DT inst editor like 2 years ago.

Deanna7332 Are there any Christmas Mod or NT songs?

AFC Eddie  Oh yeah, Diversi-Editor!

AFL JoyceM I know, Jim - but that I know he has been working on.

AFC DYAJim he projected Christmas for it, and it never came :)

AFA Gene   Not yet in AMS, but hopefully the Holiday Contest will change all
           that. :)

AFC DYAJim I look foreward to any upgrades..

AFL JoyceM Not that I am aware of Deanna - you have some?  hint, hint

Deanna7332 Nope sorry.  I was hoping there were some that could be u/led
           here

AFC DYAJim I'll be breaking out the xmas tune book rsn.. I should be able to
           midi a few :) (which rules out nt)

AFL JoyceM Question...

AFC Eddie  It would be more appropriate to have a converter from Appleworks
           spreadsheet to MOD than from MIDI!

AFL JoyceM If I got ahold of an Amiga song (MOD) disk...how would I convert
           them for here?

AFA Gene   You mean an Amiga-formatted disk?

AFL JoyceM Yes

AFC DYAJim Ack.. methinks you need an amiga and a null modem cable or a
           modem.

AFA Gene   Methinks Jim is right

AFC DYAJim LOL!!  Design your music in the spreadsheet then import to NT :)
           IT might actually have better editing?!! :)

AFC Eddie  Right!

AFL JoyceM Me thinks he is right.  If I had them upload to me, would that
           work?

AFA Gene   Yep; should work like a charm.

AFC DYAJim Yah.. as long as they're coming from an amiga

AFL JoyceM Great....I will work on that when I get back  (making note now).

AFL JoyceM Gene, will you get some of those files (NT) sent to that area
           tonight?  If so, I will leave the needed message :)

AFA Gene   That's all I have planned for tonight's chat, Joyce. Yep, I'll
           move some files right now.

AFL JoyceM Thanks...

AFL JoyceM Then we should have our NoiseTracker Library by end of the week in
           AMS :)

ELECTMUSIC Gene... quick question:  Are you launching NTracker from a 3.5
           disk?

AFL JoyceM Okay, guys...I will see you all the week of December 11th (may the
           4th) as I am off on vacation.

AFA Gene   Yep greg

AFC JohnC  Where are you going?

ELECTMUSIC Do you encounter out of memory problems

AFL JoyceM Night all...and Gene, thanks for an excellent chat and great
           explanations of NoiseTracker.

Nuzz       Joyce, I have good news for FutureSound owners. SoundConvert will
           support it in the first release

AFC Eddie  Great, Mike!

AFA Gene   Greg, i always keep my RAMdisk at 0 when using noisetracker. Not
           only are

AFC JohnC  Mike...SoundConvert...released?

AFL JoyceM Great, Mike.  When can we get SoundConvert, Mike? and FutureSound
           :)

AFA Gene   there a couple of bugs with memory management, but if you're
           loading in a MOD file that's really big, NT will eat your RAMdisk.

AFC Eddie  Sounds good.

Nuzz       The manual is being "layout". Release date should be about 1st
           week of Dec

ELECTMUSIC Tnxs Gene

AFC JohnC  YES.......WTG Nuzz!!!!!!!!

Deanna7332 Yes, why is there on some MOD files a stop somewhere in the middle
           ?

Deanna7332 That's really frustrating!

AFL JoyceM Mike, leave me E-Mail on when and how I can send your the $$ to
           get it.

AFL JoyceM Again...night all

Nuzz       gee John, I had to do something to explain the delay :)

ELECTMUSIC Thanks Gene for a GREAT chat!

AFC Eddie  Yes, Gene!  Great!

AFA Gene   Thanks Greg, 'night!

AFA Gene   thanx, see y'all later :)

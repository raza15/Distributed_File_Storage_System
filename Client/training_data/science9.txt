Introduction and Charter of the High Energy Weapons Archive

At the time of the Gulf War, Norman Schwarzkopf remarked: 

"War is a profanity because, let's face it, you've got two opposing sides
trying to settle their differences by killing as many of each other as
they can."

Which brings us to nuclear weapons...

Since the first test at Alamogordo, our world governments have exploded
in total over 2000 of these devices at their bombing ranges (Lop Nor,
Kazhakstan, Nevada, Micronesia). They've done it in the air, on the ground,
below the ground, and in the water. The tests still go on today.

The purpose of this archive is to illuminate to the reader the effects
of these nasty devices, and to warn against their use.

At this time, although the threat of a nuclear world war has reduced, 
there are other threats to our tentative peace which have emerged.
These involve regional conflicts, and the activities of terrorist parties
or nations. They involve issues such as plutonium smuggling, and the sale
of weapons technology (possibly clandestine) to militaristic nations.
 
Continued nuclear testing is also another problem. It reinforces the
position of the London Club nations, and gives incentive to the rest of
the world for removing their monopoly. In fact, this was China's
justification for joining the Club. With Pakistan and North Korea's incipient
entry, horizontal proliferation is a tangible threat. You can expect nations
involved in regional conflicts to back their threats up with a nuclear fist if
they have one. If you have a weapon and your survival is threatened, there is a
strong chance you will use it in defense, no matter the consequences. This was
the U.S. Government's justification for the A-bombing of Japan. It saved the
lives of their soldiers. Little mention was made of Japanese
civilians (collateral damage).
 
The decision to bomb Japan was made in secret. This led directly to the arms
race we are currently involved in. Russia felt threatened, and embarked on
its own bomb program, eventually producing one in 1949. In turn, the Americans
felt threatened, and embarked on the thermonuclear program. This culminated in
the pivotal Mike test of 1952. Nuclear blackmail during the Korean War led
China to make a bomb. Public disclosure and discussion before Hiroshima would
have helped avoid the situation we are in today. Hence the need for an informed
and vigilant worldwide public.
 
My aim in setting up this archive is to shine a light on the shadowy world of
high energy weapons, particularly the thermonuclear kind. You will find here
brief notes describing the conceptual basis of nuclear weapons, the
experiences of Hiroshima and Nagasaki survivors, and graphics of nuclear
explosions. The conceptual notes are based on public domain references,
and do not contain technical specifications to weapon design. In other words,
there is no quantitative information. The notes are there to show where the
product particles of nuclear weapons come from, and how they can cause damage.
These include neutrons, X-rays, and the highly radioactive fission fragments
such as strontium-90 and cesium-137. A basic grasp of what goes on inside
a weapon is helpful in understanding issues like plutonium smuggling, and
the problems of a monitoring nuclear test ban.
 
I set up this archive because I saw the need for a collation of nuclear
material on the net. To make informed decisions one needs correct and relevant
knowledge. Equipped with these brief notes, and other material found in 
the References, you can be more informed on the proliferation issue.

Please note that some of the material in the archive is pure assumption. To
support or deny some of the statements requires an extensive weapons testing
program. Please use the material as a guide only, and always check the factual
base of the material, no matter where it comes from.


Note on this Archive's History

The HEW Archive was at Melbourne University, Australia for a year, until
it was closed down by enforcement of university regulations concerning
use of computing facilities. On its impending closure, however, Xgateway
Finland Ltd offered it a new home in Espoo, Finland, just outside Helsinki.

              HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS IN YOUR HOME:
                   PROPER USE AND DISPOSAL

WHAT IS A HAZARDOUS HOUSEHOLD PRODUCT?

     The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
considers a substance hazardous if it can catch fire, if it 
can react or explode when mixed with other substances, if it 
is corrosive, or if it is toxic.  Each of these categories is 
explained in its regulations.  EPA has designated 400 specific 
substances to be hazardous.

     EPA estimates that the average household contains between 
3 and 10 gallons of hazardous chemicals.  Even improper 
disposal of such small amounts of hazardous wastes can make an 
underground water source unusable for decades if the 
contamination is not prevented.

HOW SHOULD YOU HANDLE HOUSEHOLD CHEMICALS?

     Generally, most household products should never be 
disposed of by dumping into a sink, toilet, street drain, or 
roadway.  Your household plumbing system usually leads to a 
municipal wastewater treatment plant or a septic tank 
wastewater disposal system.  However, neither is designed to 
remove hazardous chemicals completely from wastewater.  You 
should also be aware that storm sewers (street drains) usually 
flow directly into nearby streams or rivers without treatment, 
leading to direct pollution of the waterways.  Homeowners 
should reduce the purchase of products containing hazardous 
chemicals and consider nontoxic alternatives to prevent 
potential disposal, poisoning, and water pollution problems.

WHAT DISPOSAL OPTIONS DO YOU HAVE?

     The following list offers advice for using and disposing 
of most hazardous products in your home and, where possible, 
it proposes alternatives.  The recommendations listed apply to 
quantities less than 1 quart.  Your local health department, 
county health department, or State Department of Environmental 
Protection (NJDEP) Hazardous Waste Advisement Program should 
be consulted for larger quantities.  In all cases, proper 
disposal at a local hazardous waste collection center or 
program or recycling, is preferred. 

(T)=TRASH - This symbol identifies products that should never 
be poured down a drain, but can be safely disposed of by 
placing in the garbage.  Make sure products are sealed or 
capped to prevent leakage.

(H)=HOLD - This symbol identifies hazardous products that must 
be held for disposal at a local collection center or program 
or given to a hazardous waste disposal contractor.  (Even 
empty containers of these products should be handled in these 
ways.)  For more information, contact NJDEP Hazardous Waste 
Advisement Program at 609-292-8341.

(R)=RECYCLE - This symbol identifies products that can or 
should be recycled.  Take these products to the recycling 
program in your area.  If no recycling program exists, 
encourage local officials to start one.  For more information, 
contact the NJDEP Office of Recycling at 609-292-0331.

HAZARDOUS HOUSEHOLD PRODUCTS

     (H) OVEN, DRAIN, AND TOILET CLEANERS - Most of these 
products are corrosive and poisonous.  Follow directions 
carefully, exchange unused portions to neighbors and friends 
to use instead of discarding.  An alternative to oven cleaners 
is baking soda and water.  Instead of chemical drain cleaners, 
you might use a metal snake to clear pipes.  Instead of toilet 
cleaners, use a toilet brush and baking soda or a mild 
detergent.

     (H) FURNITURE POLISH, FLOOR POLISH - Certain brands are 
flammable.  Offer unused quantities to friends and neighbors.  
Do not pour down drains.  Do not dispose of these substances 
in normal trash.

     (T) OLD MEDICINES - Many products are hazardous.  Some 
medicines can be disposed of with regular trash.  Contact your 
local health department or New Jersey Department of 
Environmental Protection Hazardous Waste Advisement Program at 
609-292-8341 for more information.

     (T) DISINFECTANTS - These products are usually corrosive 
and toxic.  Do not dispose of down drains.  Fully use these 
products or recycle unused portions by exchanging them with 
friends or neighbors.

     (H) RUG AND UPHOLSTERY CLEANERS - These products are 
irritants, and are corrosive and toxic.  Do not dispose of 
these substances with regular garbage.  These products might 
be exchanged with a neighbor.

     (H) BLEACH CLEANERS - Products containing bleach are 
strong oxidizers and are corrosive.  Fully use these products 
or exchange them with neighbors or friends.  Do not dispose of 
with regular trash.

GARAGE AND WORKSHOP CHEMICALS

     (H)(R) USED MOTOR OIL, BATTERY ACID, DIESEL FUEL, FUEL 
OIL, GASOLINE, KEROSENE, PAINT BRUSH CLEANER WITH SOLVENT, 
PAINT THINNER, TURPENTINE - These products are toxic, 
flammable, and corrosive.  Do not dispose of these substances 
in the sink, toilet, street drain, or roadway.  In New Jersey, 
service stations, retail outlets, and reinspection stations 
that sell motor oil must accept up to 5 gallons of used motor 
oil for recycling.  Other products should be saved for 
disposal at local collection centers.

     (S) ANTIFREEZE, AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION FLUID, BRAKE 
FLUID, CAR WAX WITH SOLVENT, OTHER OILS, GLUE, OIL-BASED 
PAINT, PAINT STRIPPER, PRIMER, RUST REMOVER, VARNISH, WOOD 
PRESERVATIVE - These products are toxic, corrosive, and/or 
flammable.  Do not dispose of these substances in the sink, 
toilet, street drain, or roadway.  If possible, exchange or 
save for local collection centers.

     (T)(R) METAL POLISH WITH SOLVENT, PAINT BRUSH CLEANER 
WITH TSP (TRISODIUM PHOSPHATE), WATER-BASED GLUE, LATEX PAINT, 
PAINT STRIPPER (lye base) - These products are toxic.  
Exchange with neighbors.  Recycle is possible or seal tightly 
and discard with regular trash.

CHEMICALS USED OUTDOORS

     (H) PESTICIDES, HERBICIDES, INSECTICIDES, FUNGICIDES - 
Toxic.  Pesticide is usually a catch-all term for all types of 
lawn, garden, and agricultural chemicals.  Use only according 
to label or recommendations of an agricultural agent in the 
Rutgers Cooperative Extension office in your county.  
Triple-rinse containers and reuse rinse water as a 
full-strength pesticide.  Garden pesticide alternatives 
include keeping your garden weed-free by handpulling, 
importing predators, or using insecticidal soap.  Consult the 
Rutgers Cooperative Extension office in your county for 
specific agricultural and garden pesticide recommendations.

     (H) POOL CHEMICALS - In addition to being corrosive and 
toxic, these products are strong oxidizers and pose a fire and 
explosive hazard.  NEVER DISPOSE of pool chemicals with 
household trash.  Store safely until they can be fully used or 
exchanged with neighbors.


OTHER HAZARDOUS HOME PRODUCTS

     (H)(R) HOBBY CHEMICALS (CRAFTS, PHOTOGRAPHY, LABS) - 
These can be irritants, and are often corrosive, toxic, and 
flammable.  Do not dispose of these substances.  These 
chemicals should be safely stored in original containers.  
NEVER pour down drains.

     (H) ARTISTS' PAINTS, MEDIUMS, ADHESIVES - These can be 
irritants, and are often toxic and flammable.  Work area 
should be well ventilated.  Store these containers until they 
can be safely disposed of.

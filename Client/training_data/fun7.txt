 "The problem of nuclear weapon proliferation will not be solved until the
 root cause is attacked. This is the belief that nuclear weapons are desirable
 things to have, whether for use in fighting wars, in deterring and/or
 intimidating adversaries, or only as symbols of technological power or
 political equality with the mighty. Until all these motivations are shown to
 be empty, and until nuclear weapons are outlawed by a world consensus that
 they are too dangerous, politically and militarily counter-productive and
 morally unacceptable, the threat of nuclear proliferation will remain."

p.83, Uranium Enrichment & Nuclear Weapon Proliferation, SIPRI, A. Krass et al.

IMPLOSION ASSEMBLY

The idea here is to have a hollow shell of fissionable material, and compress
it using carefully placed surrounding explosives. By pressuring the material 
into a smaller volume, you increase the density. By doing so, you increase the
probability of a neutron split over neutron loss. You need a precise spherical
shock wave for compression.

The collapsed core is then irradiated with external neutrons to start fission.
The number of nuclei fissioning during later generations is proportional to
how many nuclei you have fissioning initially. This depends on the initial
neutron flux.

Fusion Boosting

At the centre of the core you can have solid Li6D. Some time before detonation
you could also inject the core with T gas, from some exterior device. The idea
is to achieve a fusion reaction in the central pit.

During implosion, the core gains a high enough temperature and
pressure for fusion reactions to occur. The synergy between fusion and fission
reactions greatly improves chain reaction efficiency. Neutrons released from
fusion have much higher energies than those released via fission processes.
When these ultra fast neutrons hit U-235 nuclei, the splitting releases more
neutrons than when U-235 are hit with fission neutrons. The chain reaction
multiplies rapidly, leading to higher temperatures, and more fusion. The
ultimate result is more U-235 splitting than you would have without the
boost.

The shell may be made of U-235 or Pu-239. The first Chinese test employed
a U-235 shell.

Another technique is to introduce a tamper of some sort, which is another shell
surrounding the fissionable material. This shell is usually made of 
Beryllium or U-238. It's purpose is to reflect escaping neutrons back into
the reaction. This has the effect of reducing the amount of fissionable
material needed for a reaction.

The Fat Man bomb used a hollow core, but present day weapons might employ a
solid (subcritical) core of fissile material. The density increase in a solid
core reduces the amount of critical mass required for a chain reaction. This
is because the reaction cross section is substantially increased.

Core Levitation

To increase the impact of the tamper on the fissionable shell, you can
levitate the shell. You leave an air gap between the two materials. This
has the effect of increasing momentum transfer, and hence facilitating
implosion. According to Ted Taylor, in John McPhee's book (see Refs):

"[Taylor] said there was something about the structure of implosion
bombs that he had not gone into, and that he could not go into, which
contributed greatly to their yield... 'All I can say is this: They
had known all along that the way to get more energy into the middle was
to hit the core harder. When you hammer a nail, what do you do? Do you
put the hammer on the nail and push?'"

     [1]  Uranium Detonator
          -----------------

              Comprised of 2 parts.  Larger mass is spherical and concave.
              Smaller mass is precisely the size and shape of the `missing'
              section of the larger mass.  Upon detonation of conventional
              explosive, the smaller mass is violently injected and welded
              to the larger mass.  Supercritical mass is reached, chain
              reaction follows in one millionth of a second.

     [2]  Plutonium Detonator
          -------------------

              Comprised of 32 individual 45-degree pie-shaped sections of
              Plutonium surrounding a Beryllium/Polonium mixture.  These 32
              sections together form a sphere.  All of these sections must
              have the precisely equal mass (and shape) of the others.  The
              shape of the detonator resembles a soccerball.  Upon detonation
              of conventional explosives, all 32 sections must merge with the
              B/P mixture within 1 ten-millionths of a second.

                      A SIMPLIFIED HALF-BOARD GAME

        I received an interesting Compuserve (CIS) email from a
        downloader of an earlier upload of CCHESS.ZIP from Dave
        Franz (CIS ID 71172,2115).  I am reproducing relevant
        parts from his email.  It shows how to play another
        game with Chinese Chess that might be easier to teach
        newcomers.  I've known Chinese mothers and young kids
        to play this game quite enjoyably.  According to Dave
        Franz, a lot of Chinese men play this game too.  I
        haven't played it myself though.  It is reproduced here
        to achieve written (in English) posterity.

        I was wondering if you knew of the half-board version
        of this game.  I learned it in Taiwan from Taxi
        drivers.  (It is played on half the board, with all the
        pieces turned down, in the center of the squares.  A
        move consists of flipping a piece over or moving a
        piece... well hopefully you know all of this.)

        First to answer your questions, I downloaded your
        upload from IBMNEW forum.  I was taught how to play the
        full board version once, but that was long ago, and I
        never practiced enough to retain the knowledge.  I
        haven't played the half board game in two years now, so
        I'm also getting rusty at that.  In this game, there
        are two players, and the game is very fast and
        exciting.  Kind of a mix-up of Checkers, Chess, Stratego
        and Poker.
        
        
                                PRE-GAME
        
        All pieces are turned upside down, mixed up, and placed
        in the center of the squares of a half board (on a 4x8
        grid).
        
        
                                STARTING
        
        CAI CHUAN (paper-rock-scissors) determines who will
        turn over the first piece to see who makes the first
        move (turns the first piece.)  The color of the first
        piece is played by the turner of that piece.
        
        
                                  PLAY
        
        A move is either (1) turning over a piece, (2) moving a
        piece one square horizontally or vertically (not
        diagonally) to another blank square, or (3) capturing
        another piece.  Obviously, at first, most of the moves
        are turning over pieces.  The object of the game is to
        eliminate all the tiles of the other player.
        
        
                           HIERARCHY OF PIECES
        
        The general can take a knight, can take a elephant, can
        take a chariot, can take a horse can take a pawn.
        Pawns can take a general, but generals can't take
        pawns.  Any piece just mentioned can capture its own
        kind or below (except general to pawn).  Cannons can
        take anything, but only by jumping over another piece,
        regardless of how far away the piece is, so long as
        there is only one piece.  (The piece captured is the
        one it lands on, not the one it jumps.)  When not
        capturing, cannons can move to adjacent free squares
        just like any other piece.  Further, cannons can be
        taken by anything but a pawn.  Capturing takes place
        for any other piece by moving to an adjacent square.

        Stalemates are possible.  The end of the game can get
        very strategy oriented.
        
        Games are not based entirely on strategy, sometimes a
        game can be won by the luck of the draw (the luck of
        the turn).
        
        Cannons tend to be the most interesting pieces in the
        game.
        
        The rules I just laid out are subject to wide
        variations.  Some of my favorite:  Cannons can jump
        consecutively, taking many pieces in one move.  Various
        pieces can move on the diagonal.  Horses can only move
        two up one over (like in regular chess).  Various
        pieces can move on the diagonal (or can move only on
        the diagonal).  Turn all pieces up at start.  etc. etc.
        etc.  Half-board Xiang Xi works like poker, when the
        dealer calls the game (ie, 7stud, draw, etc.).
        
        Well I hope this gives you a better idea of the game.
        I just wrote this on the fly, so it may not be a very
        good description.

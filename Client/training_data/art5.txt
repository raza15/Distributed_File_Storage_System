          HUNTER'S WARNING
                                          -
  I have a tale, all grim forbode
   of one who sought the night.
  He mounted, then in darkness rode
   to work upon the height.
  Control and power over all,
   the essence of his quest.
  The people he would hold in thrall.
   Ill omen was his crest.
  He found a cliff beside the sea.
   A glowing circle cast,
  with magic burnt the Sacred Tree
   and drawing sword, stood fast.
  The ocean swelled, and gale winds cried-
   a storm of ice and chill.
  Bright lightnings slashed and burned the sky
   imposed by dark'ning will.
  A gateway through the Other World
   was opened by his hand,
  For from the clouds a funnel swirled
   and Bifrost's road did stand.
  A raucous army then came down
   and rode upon that coast.
  Weird hoofbeats rang upon the ground
   from steeds who were as ghosts.
  Just from the Hunt they had returned
   to challenge fox, and deer.
  And from the leader, one eye burned
   and sighted down his spear.
  'What magus honors not my name?',
    a booming voice then cried.
  'What fool does play this ill wrought game?
    Best answer quick - or die.'
    'My title matters not, O Lord.',
      the sly tongued one did speak.
    'We share the spirit of the sword-
      your wisdom I would seek.'
  'My secrets will I gladly give
    to all who share my way-
   but test ye must, to die or live-
    one chance to go or stay.'
    'Though death is not the thing I crave,
      your questions will I bear.
     And favour lacking, to the grave
      and thralldom will I swear.'
    'But I am learn'ed, wise and strong
      so if your test surpassed
     you must then swear before your throng
      your power you will pass.'
  The Hunt Lord scowled, and it was done,
   then said with frosty breath:
 'Unto me you will answer one-
   what purpose does serve death?'
    'My foes have often met their end.
      I glory in the kill.
     My way will use the death to bend
      the people to my will.'
  The Goddess Freyja then impart:
  'What say you of the dove?
  What use to you are things of heart?
   Regard ye what of love?'
    'I scorn all love, I favour wrath,
      tis best left for the meek.
     And peaceful ways cross not my path,
      tis only for the weak.'
 'War is my art, so answer this:',
   spoke grim one handed Tyr.
 'Affairs of state, when go amiss-
   is honor in your sphere?'
    'All honor I return to friends
      and other Lords deserved.
     I say again, foes meet their ends
      when wrath has been incurred.'
 'Unto us now, one more reply
   before you hear our will.
  of spells and power - magic high,
   of what does this fulfill?
    'To honor you, I would enshrine,
      the world then I would take.
     To snare, all shiftless peoples bind
      with forces I would wake.'
  All Asgard's dwellers, looking grim,
   then nodded to this king.
  Triumphant mein came over him-
   his darkened soul did ring.
  But Odin set his rage filled face-
   the mages blood ran cold.
 'Ye think that thou hast won our grace
   with naked evil bold?'
 'All death is but the way to birth
   and peace is men's desire.
  Our way is to renew the Earth-
   despoiling not in ire.'
 'This and the magics meant to heal
   and guide on wisdom's path.
  So this is why the powers wield-
   you have incurred our wrath.'
 'But go in sorrow - life we give,
   along with this one curse-
  That ever long as you shall live
   your life now is reversed.'
 'Harm with your magic, and you die
   a death forever long.
  Hurt with your guile, and you shall cry-
   your way is twisted, wrong.'
  They rode like leaves upon the wind.
   Ensorcelled mage grew mad.
  He wanders - never trust or friends.
   Just woe, dark soul, nomad.
  Pay heed, all seekers on the path
   to shadow's knowledge earned.
  To evil go, you gain the wrath
   of Powers great and stern.

For Gwydion, page 1


        To Remember Thomas DeLong,
        Who Wrote as Gwydion Pendderwen,
        On the Second Anniversary
        Of His Going into Eternal Life

I remember the night I first met you
On Bernal Heights, before we knew
The Craft would cross our paths.
The strident horn of your flaming car
Drew me to the street: before
The doors of Hightower, where
Lord Randall ruled his mad
Court of science-fictioneers,
Van the Dagda read an Anglican wake
Over your still-smoking engine.
I remember you, and I begin to let you go.

I remember how you sang to me and Alta
When you first visited us in Oakland,
And how you gifted us at our wedding,
Singing us new a wedding song
Worthy, I think, of the kings
We thought we were perhaps descended from.
On the first anniversary of your death
I heard Sally Eaton sing of you
A wilder music than I knew she held.
As dragonflies draw flame your voice
Has drawn and draws forth song.
I remember you, and so I try to let you go.

I remember the nights I came to your circle
Or you to ours: cautiously we reached
Toward friendship, dialog, pursuit of the chimeras
Of history.  You praised me, friend, in print,
To our friends, and to our enemies,
Whether you agreed with me or not.  In Nemeton you
And Alison published more of my poems
Than any other person ever has.  We were
Initiates in the same tradition at the end,
And no conversion or dying or any other
Transformation changes that.  It hurt, and still
It hurts, that you are gone.
I remember you, and so I slowly let you go.

I remember the nights when we drank together,
Drank and talked and talked and drank again:
The night I met Ed Sitch, the night we bombed
Hans Holzer, the Sabbats at Coeden Brith.
Especially I remember how on my last drunk
You gave me a clew that helped lead me
From the labyrinth: only a real Irishman,
You said, would carry the wine jug with us
From room to room as we rambled on
About things earthly, unearthly, and in between.
And you were with me that night,
In that car with no brakes in which I drove
Six people home, over the Bay Bridge,
Fading in and out of blackout.
I remember, vaguely -- but I've let that go.

At thirty-six I got sober;
At thirty-six you died
Of drink and drugs and dying
As surely as if you has
OD'd.  It is not
Fair, it is not
Just, it makes no
Sense: you weren't that much
Crazier than me.  I hoped
You'd get it too, and we'd be
Friends again, but that was not
Your path.  Toward the end I heard
How rapidly you were dying,
How little song was left in you.
You did not die of poetry.
Now on each anniversary of my sobriety
I remember you, and more I let you go.

Strange that the night you died I dreamed
I met George Cockriell, who'd lived with me
On Bernal Heights, who died of World War Two
In 1971.  Striding down the hill, as if
Off to something urgent, he stopped, surprised,
Saying, "I haven't seen you recently,"
And questioned me about what I'd been doing.
And in the dream all our houses were one
Communal home on Bernal Heights, handbuilt,
Complex in its textures, vast within: perhaps
Our work on the Craft will have results we could
Not know.  
                 Yes, George could have been sent
To get you from that ditch: he'd known who you were
On Bernal Heights, had watched the Hightower crowd
With his black Irish sarcasm, and God knows in France
He'd walked through Hell already to rescue other men.
("Why you?" 
                  "They've got nobody else who knew you.
Come on, I'll explain what I've found out so far.")
So, yes, I can see George walking with you,
Quietly explaining the lay of the land,
Walking with you up the hills of Heaven that look
Much like Bernal Heights,
Much like all our hills writ large.

I can see you singing, with a real harp,
Of real gold, in a robe all of white
Except for the seven colors proper to a bard
Embroidered in its flashing: you are
Wreathed with mistletoe.  
                                         I see your eyes:
They are clear and serene: in the distance
You can see the accommodating gods and goddesses,
Who are both one and many.  They sing to you,
Drawing you always further in
And further up.  Now you go
Singing ever higher into the hills:
You are finally, utterly healed.
I remember you, and now:
I let you go.

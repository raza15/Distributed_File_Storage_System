PROJECT EXPERIENCE
• Distributed file storage Web Application: Used Ruby on Rails web framework. A distributed join
algorithm implemented at backend.
• Real-Time Web Application using NodeJS, Javascript, and, socketio: Users play a tick-tack-toe
game with each other in real-time. Project uploaded on GitHub:
https://github.com/raza15/NodeJS-TicTacToe-multigame
• Web Application using NodeJS, Javascript, and, MongoDB: It was an exam sharing web
application. Prominent Features: Professors can add questions to a common test bank, share their exams
with specific other users, suggestions in a dropdown menu while searching questions in the test bank.

• RESTful SaaS Web Application using Ruby on Rails, and, MySQL: Allows instructors and
students to
 manage their courses, instructors add courses, students enroll, instructors post content for a
course as he/she pleases. Plus, there’s a common discussion forum provided where students and instructors
chat. Project uploaded at GitHub: https://github.com/hamza121star/Software-Engineering-Project
• Reverse Engineering Android Applications: Figured out a way to decompile and reuse source code of
existing android applications. After this, decompiled various existing android applications, made changes
to their code and data files, recompiled them and tested them on an android device. Tools used: apk tool,
zipalign, signapk. Project uploaded on GitHub:

• Design and Implementation of Scalable and Fault-tolerant Distributed Password Cracking
System: The goal of the project was to create a system that utilizes multiple computing nodes to
efficiently distribute the workload. The system was fault tolerant as it continued to function if any node
fa
iled, by redistributing the workload and by recovering to its previous stable state if all the nodes or the
central server crashed.
• Implementation of a Data Mining Supervised Learning Algorithm: A Data Mining project of
training an algorithm to detect positive and negative tweets. Scrapped(using Twitter API) and used data
relating to US Presidential Elections 2012 for training and testing the model.
• Android Runtime vs. Dalvik VM: Performed a performance comparison of Android Runtime(ART)
and Dalvik VM running on android devices.
• Exploration and Measurement of fraudulent reputation manipulation on Facebook: It was a
measurement study of web services that were exploiting a vulnerability in existing Facebook applications to
provide on-demand reputation enhancement on Facebook content. I found more than 1 million Facebook
users associated with these services by writing web crawlers in python.
• Design and implementation of a Distributed Data Mining Clustering Algorithm: K-Means
algorithm on GPU nodes.

of torrential rains, they were forced to wallow in knee-deep mud.
There were no shelters, and no way to get out. Cars were parked over
eight miles away.  Rosenman writes that the key to the ""Woodstock
experiment'' was ""keeping our performers performing around the
clock...to keep the kids transfixed...''
   Within the first 24 hours, over 300 kids reported to medical
authorities, violently ill. The diagnosis: they were having ""bad'' LSD
trips. Thousands more would follow. On August 17, the <New York Times>
reported: ""Tonight, a festival announcer warned from the stage, that
'badly manufactured acid' (a term for LSD) was being circulated. He
said: 'You aren't taking poison acid. The acid's not poison. It's just
badly manufactured acid. You are not going to die.... So if you think
you've taken poison, you haven't. But if you're worried, just take
half a tablet.'|''
    The advice, to nearly 500,000 people, ""just take half a tablet''
was given by none other than MK-Ultra agent Wavy Gravy.
   With a growing medical emergency on hand, a call went out to New
York City for emergency medical personnel.  Over 50 doctors and nurses
were flown in. By the end of Woodstock, a total of 5,000 medical cases
were reported.


Altamont: the Making
Of a Snuff Film

   The last major rock ""festival'' of the 1960s was held at Altamont
racetrack, outside San Francisco. The featured performers were the
Rolling Stones, who now reigned supreme in the rock world, since the
Beatles had broken up. The suggestion for the concert came from
MK-Ultra agent Ken Kesey.
   This time, the audience was whipped into a frenzy, in open praise
of the Devil. The result was a literal Satanic orgy. At its
conclusion, four people were dead and dozens beaten and injured.  Mick
Jagger, the lead singer of the Rolling Stones, played the part of
Lucifer. The performance marked the beginning of the ""heavy-metal''
concerts of today.
   Over 400,000 people attended the Altamont concert with far less
preparation than even Woodstock. Food, and even water, were nearly
unavailable. But plenty of drugs were to be found. Like Woodstock, the
concert would become the vehicle for the mass experimentation of
drugs, especially LSD. Author Tony Sanchez describes the scene as
people gathered at Altamont:
   ""By midmorning there were more than a quarter of a million people
milling around, and things were becoming chaotic. There was a lot of
bad acid (LSD-DP) around, and people were freaking out all over the
place.  Everybody was getting stoned out of his skull to pass the long
hours before the music was to start--Mexican grass, cheap California
wine, amphetamines ...
      ""By midday virtually everyone was tripping...A man was almost
killed as he tried to fly from a speedway bridge--another acid case.
On the other side of the site a young guy screamed for help as he fell
into the deep waters of a drainage canal. The stoned-out freaks looked
on bemused as he sank beneath the surface. No one seemed sure if he
had been real or an hallucination. It didn't matter anymore anyway, he
was dead. Elsewhere doctors were kept busy delivering babies to girls
giving hysterical premature birth.''
   The descent into Hell would continue. The Rolling Stones had hired,
for a reported $500 worth of free beer, the motorcycle gang Hell's
Angels to act as security guards for the concert.  Their real payment,
however, was in drug sales. The Hell's Angels, an outlaw gang made up
of robbers, rapists and murderers, were the known controllers and
sellers of drugs on the entire West Coast.
   When the festival did open, the crowd of nearly half a million
people waited for more than one and a half hours for the Stones to
appear. It was only when nightfall arrived, allowing for the use of
special lighting effects, that the group finally came on stage. Mick
Jagger, the lead singer, was dressed in a satin cape, which glowed red
under the lights. Jagger was imitating Lucifer.
   Author Sanchez next describes what he calls a preplanned ""Satanic
ritual.''  As the group began playing, ""strangely several of the kids
were stripping off their clothes and crawling to the stage as if it
were a high altar, there to offer themselves as victims for the boots
and cues of the Angels. The more they were beaten and bloodied, the
more they were impelled, as if by some supernatural force, to offer
themselves as human sacrifices to these agents of Satan.''
   Standing in the crowd in front of the stage, with his girlfriend,
was a black man by the name of Meredith Hunter. Hunter would soon be
singled out for human sacrifice.
   The Stones had just released a new song entitled, ""Sympathy for the
Devil.'' It had quickly become the number one record in the country.
The song begins with Mick Jagger introducing himself as Lucifer. As
soon as he began to sing it at Altamont, the entire audience rose up
and began dancing in a wild frenzy.
   Sanchez descibes what happened next, ""A great six foot four grizzly
bear of a Hell's Angel had stalked across to Meredith (Hunter) to pull
his hair hard in an effort to provoke a fight ...A fight broke out,
five more Angels came crashing to the aid of their buddy, while
Meredith tried to run off through the packed crowd. An Angel caught
him by the arm and brought down a sheath knife hard in the black man's
back. The knife failed to penetrate deeply, but Meredith knew then
that he was fighting for his life.  He ripped a gun out of his pocket
and pointed it straight at the Angel's chest... And then the Angels
were upon him like a pack of wolves. One tore the gun from his hand,
another stabbed him in the face and still another stabbed him
repeatedly, insanely, in the back until his knees buckled.
   ""When the Angels finished with Hunter, several people tried to come
to his aid, but an Angel stood guard over the motionless body. `Don't
touch him,' he said menacingly. `He's going to die anyway, so just let
him die.'|''
   It was never proven that Meredith actually had a gun. Later,
arrests were made. No one was ever indicted because no one person
would step forward as a witness out of fear of retaliation by the
Angels.
   Throughout the bloody killing the Rolling Stones continued to play
""Sympathy for the Devil.'' The entire group watched from the stage as
Meredith Hunter was killed right before them. In addition, incredibly,
the entire murder was professionally filmed by a film crew hired to
film the concert. Shortly thereafter the film was released throughout
the country with the title of a Rolling Stone's song, ""Gimme
Shelter.''
   Was the murder preplanned by Satanists? In his book, <The Ultimate
Evil,> author Maury Terry tells how Satanic cults circulate among
themselves films of their human sacrifices. These films are called
""snuff films.'' Terry relates that one of the seven Son of Sam murders
in New York City was actually filmed from a nearby parked van. The
film was then purchased by a rich Satanist.
   ""Gimme Shelter,'' which was a box-office hit, can still be
purchased or rented today for only a few dollars, at your local video
store.


Behind ""Heavy-Metal'' Rock

   The same year as Altamont, 1969, marked the beginning of the evil
career of Ozzie Osbourne. Osbourne formed the band Black Sabbath. The
group modelled itself on the Rolling Stones. The next fifteen years
would witness a procession of young drugged-out rock performers, like
Osbourne, each competing for the ""big money'' and the recording
contracts that came with it.  The key criteria of those who would
""make it'' was their ability to portray decadence and evil. These were
the ""heavy-metal'' groups.
   In 1985, <New Solidarity> newspaper, which has since been forcibly
shut down by the federal government, conducted an interview with
Hezekiah Ben Aaron, then the third-ranking member of the Church of
Satan. Ben Aaron is now a devout Christian. In the interview, Aaron
revealed that it was his Church that started such ""heavy-metal'' rock
groups as Black Sabbath, The Blue Oyster Cult, The Who, Ozzy Osbourne,
and many others. The Church of Satan was then led by its high priest,
Anton LaVey.  Many report, however, that LaVey, a former circus lion
tamer, was just a front man for the real high priest, Kenneth Anger,
the man who earlier recruited the Rolling Stones to the occult.
   The following is an excerpt from that interview: ""I was working for
the Church...the Church had other people who were middlemen for other
companies.  There were middlemen for Apple [set up by the Beatles],
Warner Brothers, and other record companies. Someone would come to me
and say, `I have a tape recording, and I'd like for you to check it
out. I'd like to see if you would be interested in sponsoring a Rock
group.' I'd say `All right, I'll check it out.' A few days later Ben
Aaron would call back and set up another meeting. He continues, `I'd
hand you $100,000, and you wouldn't sign anything. What you wouldn't
know is that a mirror on the back of the wall is a one-way mirror and
we're tape recording and photographing, or video taping everything
that goes on. The payback, if you fail to make the group work, is
really bad. Sometimes it's up to 60% on the dollar.''
    Aaron's interview continued: ""we send you to a store, we provide
you with uniforms and we provide you with amplifiers. It's all paid
through the money we gave you. We set you up with a road tour. We set
you up with engagements. We book you.''
   Aaron then explained that if the group did not make it he was given
orders to collect the money or make other ""arrangements.'' These
""other arrangements,'' perhaps, are the key to the dozens of reported
rock star ""suicides.'' The underworld drug mafia has ample means to
eliminate non-payers. Some readers may remember the following
statement Beatle John Lennon made to the international press back in
1966:
   ""Christianity will go. It will go.  It will vanish and shrink. I
needn't argue about that. I'm right and I will be proved right. We are
more popular than Jesus now.''
    Hopefully, he will be proven to be wrong.

raza1@gmail.com,fun10.txt," your 
insurer can legally require payment of 100% of your premium.  



       Should you choose to pay less than your total bill, it 
is likely that you will have to pay some kind of finance 
charge.  Choose your finance plan carefully.  Commercial 
lenders and insurance premium finance agencies charge up to 18% 
interest per year on the unpaid balance.  Insurance premium 
finance agencies may also charge an additional $16 fee for 
setting up the account. 
       For many policyholders, another way of making time 
payments is to do business with an insurance company that will 
bill you in installments and charge a flat fee for each 
billing.  These charges vary from company to company and 
according to the number of installments you want to make.  In 
some instances the company's carrying charges will cost less 
than other financing arrangements.  

Discount Opportunities
       Be particularly careful to answer those application 
questions relating to the following five discounts, which can 
cut your insurance costs considerably if you qualify for them.  
       * Low Mileage Discount -  If you drive 5,000 or fewer 
miles per year, you are eligible for the maximum 10% discount.  
If you drive between 5,001 and 7,500 miles per year, you are 
eligible for a 5% discount. The discount applies to all 
coverages except Comprehensive, Substitute Transportation and 
Towing and Labor, and applies to the rate for each insured car 
as otherwise determined by territory, driver class, vehicle 
model year and symbol, prior to the application of SDIP 
surcharges or credits. 
       * Senior Citizen Discount - Drivers 65 years or older 
who are principal operators of their cars receive a 25% 
reduction on all their auto coverages, provided there is no 
inexperienced driver (one with less than six years of driving 
experience) listed on their policies.  Cars used for business 
are not eligible.  The 25% discount does not apply to SDIP 
Surcharge Points. 
       * Public Transportation Discount - Choosing to take 
public transportation instead of using your automobile can save 
you 10% on your property damage liability and collision 
coverages.  The maximum discount is $75.  To obtain this 
discount, you must show evidence of purchase of 11 months of 
commuter passes or tickets from a qualified transit system.
       * Anti-Theft and Recovery System Discounts- 
Policyholders who install certain kinds of anti-theft devices 
are eligible for a 5%, 15%, or 20% discount on Comprehensive 
coverages.  The installation of a signal-activated vehicle 
recovery system, in combination with an approved anti-theft 
device, can qualify you for a savings between 25%-35%.  The 
size of the discount varies, depending on the kind of 
anti-theft device, and whether it is combined with a vehicle 
recovery system.  



       You should seriously consider buying and using some kind 
of anti-theft device and/or vehicle recovery system.  Before 
you choose a particular brand or model, check with your agent, 
broker or company representative about the discount.  A quick 
check before you buy can help you avoid an expensive 
misunderstanding later.  
       * Multi-Vehicle Discount - Individuals and married 
couples who own more than one car and insure them for Collision 
or Limited Collision coverage with the same company can get a 
5% discount on these coverages.  This discount is available 
only to experienced drivers. 

       Inexperienced drivers can realize a 10% savings on three 
of the four compulsory coverages and on optional liability and 
collision coverages, if they complete an approved 
driver-training course.  The savings is calculated into the 
rates for the particular driver classifications.
       Finally, you can affect the cost of your policy by how 
you and the other operators of your auto drive.  You will 
receive Credit Points on your policy if you and the other 
operators maintain good driving records.  More detailed 
information about the Safe Driver Insurance Plan can be found 
in Part 4 of this guide. 
       


              THE 1990 SAFE DRIVER INSURANCE PLAN

       If you and the other drivers listed on your policy have 
incident-free driving history records, then your insurance 
premium for Bodily Injury to Others (Part l), Personal Injury 
Protection (Part 2), Damage to Someone Else's Property (Part 4) 
and Collision (Part 7) coverages will be reduced by the 
application of Credit Points, helping to lower your total 
automobile insurance bill.  If you or any other driver listed 
on your policy caused an accident or violated any surchargeable 
motor vehicle traffic law, your insurance premium for Parts 1, 
2, 4, and 7 will increase due to the application of Surcharge 
Points.
       The 1990 Safe Driver Insurance Plan 211 CMR 125.00 is 
published in accordance with the authority granted to the 
Commissioner of Insurance under Massachusetts General Laws 
Chapter 175 Section 113B.

HIGHLIGHTS OF THE 1990 SAFE DRIVER INSURANCE PLAN
       * All operators on a policy will be assigned an SDIP
       Step. 
       * Six years of driving history will be used to rate your 
       policy. 
       * An SDIP Step is determined by adding Surcharge Points
       for surchargeable incidents within the policy Experience 
       Period to a starting step value of 15 and subtracting 
       Credit Points for each year of incident-free driving 
       within the policy Experience Period for which the 
       operator was licensed to drive in Massachusetts. 
       * Operators will receive one Credit Point for each year
       of incident-free driving for which they were licensed to 
       drive in Massachusetts.
       * Surcharge Points for Surchargeable Incidents have 
       increased.
       * Aging of incidents has been eliminated.

SAFE DRIVER INSURANCE PLAN (SDIP) STEPS
       The 1990 Safe Driver Insurance Plan assigns an SDIP Step 
to each operator listed on a policy.  For policy year 1990 the 
SDIP Step range is from 09 to 35.  SDIP Step 09 is the Best 
Credit Step for 1990.
       All operators enter the step system at Step 15, the 
neutral step - no increase or decrease in automobile insurance 
premium.  Each operator's SDIP Step is computed by adding to 
the starting step value of 15, Surcharge Points for 
surchargeable incidents within the policy Experience Period, 
and then subtracting Credit Points earned by the operator for 
each incident-free year within the policy Experience Period or 
special Credit Points for the Clean Slate Rule.



       This equation will help you determine your operator SDIP 
Step:
                     STARTING STEP  15
                   + SURCHARGE POINTS
                   - CREDIT POINTS
                   ----------------------
                   = OPERATOR'S SDIP STEP

EXPERIENCE PERIOD
       The Experience Period of a 1990 policy is the 6 year 
period immediately preceding the policy effective date.  The 
Experience Period is expected to increase each year by 1 year 
up to 15 years.  For example, the Experience Period of a policy 
in 1991 is expected to be 7 years.

CREDIT POINTS
       One Credit Point is subtracted from the starting step of 
15 for each incident-free year of driving during the policy 
Experience Period.  An incident free year of driving is any of 
the 1-year periods immediately preceding the policy effective 
date for which the operator has been licensed to drive in 
Massachusetts and during which the operator has not had a 
surchargeable at-fault accident or motor vehicle traffic 
violation.
       EXAMPLE: If you have been licensed to drive in 
Massachusetts for 10 years, there are no surchargeable 
incidents on your driving history record and your policy 
effective date is 01/01/90, you will be placed at SDIP Step 09, 
the Best Credit, for 1990.  To compute this yourself, first 
determine either the date you obtained your Massachusetts 
driver's license or the beginning date of your policy 
Experience Period (preceding 6 years), whichever is later.  In 
this example, 01/01/84, the beginning date of the policy 
Experience Period, is later.  Next, subtract 6 Credit Points - 
1 point for each incident-free year within the Experience 
Period - from the neutral step 15.  The resulting number is 
your operator SDIP Step.

       STARTING STEP       01/01/84          15
       CREDIT POINTS                       - 06
                                            -----
       OPERATOR SDIP STEP                  = 09

       Operators with less than 6 years of driving experience 
will receive Credit Points for only those incident-free years 
for which they were licensed to drive in Massachusetts.  
       Operators licensed to drive in Massachusetts for less 
than 1 year will be placed at SDIP Step 15, the neutral step.

SURCHARGEABLE INCIDENTS AND SURCHARGE POINTS
       At-Fault Accidents - If you are involved in an accident 
and you file a Collision claim, or if another person 


files a claim under Damage To Someone Else's Property, your 
insurance company must determine who was more than 50% 
at-fault.  It makes no difference whether the at-fault accident 
occurred within the Commonwealth or out-of-state.  
       There are two types of at-fault accidents.  A Minor 
At-Fault Accident is a claim payment under Damage to Someone 
Else's Property, Collision or Limited Collision coverage of 
more than $200 but not more than $1,500 and a Major At-Fault 
Accident is a claim payment under Damage to Someone Else's 
Property, Collision or Limited Collision coverage of more than 
$1,500.
       If your company finds that you were at-fault and pays a 
claim of more than $200, the at-fault accident will be added to 
your operator's driving history record and your company will 
send you a Surcharge Notice.  The Surcharge Date for an 
at-fault accident is the Date of Notice entered by your insurer 
on the Surcharge Notice form.  The accident will become part of 
your driving history record unless the company withdraws the 
Surcharge Notice or you successfully appeal the notice to the 
Board of Appeal.   

       Appealing At-Fault Accidents- Accident surcharges must 
be appealed at the time you receive the Surcharge Notice from 
your insurance company.  Detailed instructions for filing an 
appeal are on the Surcharge Notice.  The Board of Appeal on 
Motor Vehicle Liability Policies and Bonds will hold the 
hearing and will notify you, your company and the Merit Rating 
Board of its decision.  If the Board determines that you were 
not more than 50% at-fault in the accident, the Merit Rating 
Board will remove the incident from your driving history record.
       If your premium is increased due to Surcharge Points for 
an at-fault accident while your appeal is pending, you must pay 
the additional premium or your policy will be cancelled.  Your 
policy will be re-rated by your insurance company if you win 
your appeal.  
       If you have any questions concerning an appeal of a 
Surcharge Notice, contact the Board of Appeal at (617) 
727-7189, extension #223.

       Motor Vehicle Traffic Law Violations - If you are 
convicted of, or make payments for, violating certain motor 
vehicle traffic laws, or are assigned to an alcohol education 
program, the court will notify the Merit Rating Board.  The 
motor vehicle traffic law violation will be added to your 
driving history record.  The court judgment date is the 
Surcharge Date for a motor vehicle traffic law violation.
       Surcharge Points are not assigned to a non-criminal 
minor motor vehicle traffic law violation if it is the first 
motor vehicle traffic law violation in the operator's policy 


Experience Period.  No Surcharge Points are assessed for the 
incident but no Credit Points are calculated for the year in 
which the surcharge date is recorded, since the operator does 
not have an incident-free year.
       A list of all surchargeable Motor Vehicle Traffic Law 
Violations can be obtained from the Merit Rating Board.

       Out of-State Violations - Convictions of Motor Vehicle 
Traffic Laws outside the Commonwealth that are reported to the 
Registry of Motor Vehicles will be added to the operator's 
driving history record and will be subject to Surcharge Points.

       Surcharge Points - The number of Surcharge Points 
assigned to each surchargeable incident is determined by the 
type of incident:

       Minor Traffic Law Violation      2 Surcharge Points
       Minor At-Fault Accident          3 Surcharge Points
       Major At-Fault Accident          4 Surcharge Points
       Major Traffic Law Violation      5 Surcharge Points

       EXAMPLE: If you have been licensed to drive in 
Massachusetts for 8 years; you have 2 Minor Traffic Law 
Violations and 1 Minor At-Fault Accident on your driving 
history record and your policy effective date is 01/01/90, then 
your SDIP Step will be 17.

OPERATOR SDIP STEP                                         = 17

COMPREHENSIVE CLAIMS
       Your insurance company is required to notify the Merit 
Rating Board when a Comprehensive claim has been paid.  
Comprehensive claims are added to the policyholder's driving 
history record.  In future years the Comprehensive coverage on 
your private passenger automobile insurance policy may be 
subject to Surcharge Points if you submit four or more 
Comprehensive claims on or after January 1, 1984, totaling 
$2,000 or more.  
       Surcharge Points for Comprehensive claims will not be 
applied for policies effective in 1990.




ASSIGNMENT OF OPERATOR SDIP STEPS TO VEHICLES LISTED ON A POLICY
       After each operator listed on your policy is assigned an 
SDIP Step, the operators are assigned to the vehicles listed on 
the policy.  The listed operator with the highest Step is 
assigned to the vehicle with the highest combined premium for 
Parts 1, 2, 4, and 7.  For each subsequent vehicle, the listed 
operator with the next highest Step is assigned to the vehicle 
with the next highest combined premium until all the vehicles 
have been exhausted.  An operator's SDIP Step greater than SDIP 
Step 15 can not be billed on more than one policy in effect at 
the same time.  
       When there are more vehicles than operators listed on a 
policy, the excess vehicles are assigned the step of the 
operator with the lowest Step unless such operator's Step is 
above SDIP Step 15.  In such case, the excess vehicles are 
assigned SDIP Step 15. 

EXAMPLE: A policy lists four (4) vehicles and three (3) 
operators:  Operator A's SDIP Step is 20, Operator B's SDIP 
Step is 15 and Operator C's SDIP Step is 09.

       Vehicles                Operators
       1                       A. SDIP Step 20
       2                       B. SDIP Step 15
       3                       C. SDIP Step 09
       4                       C. SDIP Step 09

APPLICATION OF PREMIUM ADJUSTMENTS TO COVERAGES
       An operator's SDIP Step determines how much of an 
adjustment will be made to the policy premium.  SDIP Steps 09 
(Best Credit) to 14 are Credit Steps.  For each step below 15 
the operator's premium will be adjusted downwards.  Step 15 is 
the neutral step, which means the operator is neither in credit 
nor surcharge status, and will not receive a reduction or an 
increase in premium.  Step 16 through 35 are Surcharge Steps.  
For each step above 15 the operator's premium will be adjusted 
upwards.  If you wish to calculate the actual amount of your 
credit or surcharge, refer to ""Calculation of SDIP Credits and 
Surcharges"" at the end of this section.

       Liability Premium- Each step represents a 7% change in 
the following liability coverages:
       Part l:       Bodily Injury to Others
       Part 2:       Personal Injury Protection
       Part 4:       Damage to Someone Else's Property (PDL)

       Collision Premium- Each step represents a 5% change in 
Collision Coverage:
       Part 7:       Collision




       Example: If you have been licensed to drive in 
Massachusetts for six years; you have no incidents on your 
6-year driving history record; your SDIP Step is 09; and you 
have Liability and Collision coverages on your policy, then you 
will receive a 42% (7% X 6 steps) reduction on your Liability 
coverages and a 30% (5% X 6 steps) reduction on your Collision 
coverage.

CLEAN SLATE RULES
       The Safe Driver Insurance Plan provides incentives to 
operator's who have incidents on their record in the early 
years of the Experience Period, but in subsequent years have 
maintained clean driving history records.

       Transitional Clean Slate Rule- In order to ensure a fair 
and equitable transition from the 1989 Safe Driver Insurance 
Plan, the 1990 Safe Driver Insurance Plan includes a Clean 
Slate Rule.  For 1990, a 3-Year Clean Slate Rule will place an 
operator in a credit step if that operator would have been in 
credit status under the 1989 SDIP. 
       If the operator's SDIP Step is greater than 15, the 
operator's SDIP Step will be set at 14 if all of the following 
conditions for the Clean Slate Rule are met:

Three (3) Year Clean Slate Rule applies to an operator on a 
1990 policy if:
a.     the operator has a three year period of incident free 
       driving within the policy Experience Period;
b.     the three year period occurs after 1/1/87 and before 
       12/31/90;
c.     the operator had a valid Massachusetts driver license 
       for the entire three year incident-free period; and
d.     the operator's SDIP step at the end of the incident-free 
       period would be greater than 14.  Then the operator's 
       SDIP step is set to 14.
Points for surchargeable incidents within the policy Experience 
Period which have surcharge dates that are recorded after this 
3-year incident free period are added to operator SDIP Step 14. 

       Clean Slate Incentive- As an incentive to promote safe 
driving, a Five (5) Year Clean Slate provision has been added 
for policies effective after 1991.  If an operator maintains 
five consecutive years of incident-free driving within the 
policy Experience Period, and the operator's SDIP Step is 
greater than 15, then the operator's SDIP Step will be set at 
15.  The operator must have a valid Massachusetts driver's 
license for the entire five year incident free period. 
SAFE DRIVER INSURANCE PLAN (SDIP) STATEMENT
       Your insurance company is required to send you a Safe 
Driver Insurance Plan (SDIP) Statement if you or any operator 
listed on your policy are not assigned Operator Step 09, the 
Best Credit for 1990.

REFUSAL TO PAY A PREMIUM INCREASE
       If you refuse to pay your premium increase due to 
Surcharge Points, your insurance company will cancel your 
policy after sending you the Notice of Cancellation required by 
law.

RECORD ERROR OR BILLING PROBLEMS
       If you believe a billing is erroneous, you should first 
contact your insurance agent, broker or company.  Make sure you 
have all necessary information on hand, including your Coverage 
Selections Page, Safe Driver Insurance Plan (SDIP) Statement 
and copies of your billings.
       If you question the accuracy of your driving history 
record as shown on your Safe Driver Insurance Plan (SDIP) 
Statement call or write the Merit Rating Board's Insurance 
Company Services Section, 100 Nashua Street, 6th Floor, Boston, 
MA 02114, (617) 727-7017.  You must pay a billed premium while 
the matter is under investigation or your insurance company 
will cancel your policy.  If an error is discovered, it will be 
corrected and all parties will be notified in writing.  If you 
were erroneously billed your insurance company will re-rate 
your policy.

OBTAINING A COPY OF YOUR OPERATOR DRIVING HISTORY RECORD
       You may obtain a copy of your operator driving history 
record from the Merit Rating Board.  This detailed record will 
show six years of your active surchargeable incidents on file 
at the Merit Rating Board.  The cost is $3.00.  DO NOT MAIL 
CASH.  Make check or money order payable to the Commonwealth of 
Massachusetts.
       No fee is required to inspect your computer record at 
the Merit Rating Board's office.  However, a prior appointment 
must be made with the Board's Insurance Company Service Section.
CALCULATION OF SDIP CREDITS AND SURCHARGES
       Your total policy credit or surcharge is determined by 
multiplying the coverage premium shown on your Coverage 
Selections Page by the factor which corresponds to your SDIP 
Step (see below), and then adding the products for all four 
coverages.  Subtract this number from your total premium if you 
are determining a credit. Add this number to your total premium 
if you are determining a surcharge.

                       FILING A COMPLAINT

       If you believe that your insurance company has acted 
improperly in issuing, renewing or cancelling your automobile 
insurance policy, or has refused to pay all or part of a fair 
claim, or your agent, broker or company has misrepresented you, 
you have the right to file a complaint and seek a resolution.  
       The problem may be due to a simple error, and may be 
corrected with an inquiry over the telephone.  Contact your 
agent, broker or company representative.  Make sure you have all 
necessary information on hand, such as the policy or account 
number, a clear and concise description of the problem and any 
other important information.
       If you do not receive a prompt, satisfactory response, 
write a letter to the company briefly explaining your problem and 
what you expect to be done to correct it.  It may be a good idea 
to send the letter by registered mail to guarantee that the 
company receives it.  
       If you still feel you have been treated unfairly, send a 
complaint letter to the Division of Insurance, and we will assist 
you in resolving your problem.  Be sure to include your name, 
address, and phone number; the name of the agent, broker or 
insurance company; the policy number; and a brief description of 
the problem.  Make sure you keep a copy of the letter and any 
other documents you include with the letter, for your own 
records.  Keep all letters, receipts, bills and policies together 
for easy reference.  The Division of Insurance has Consumer 
Service offices located at:

       280 Friend Street      436 Dwight Street, Rm. 438
       Boston, MA 02114       Springfield, MA  01103
       (617) 727-3333         (413) 784-1190

       We will make every effort to ensure that your valid 
complaint is resolved in a satisfactory manner, by investigating 
the problem, clarifying misunderstandings and making sure you get 
clear responses to your questions.  We cannot however, guarantee 
a favorable action on your complaint if it is not supported by 
facts or the law, nor can we provide legal services that may be 
required to settle a more complicated complaint.

Isn't it annoying when boards add these damn files to the zips? Well, don't
worry. This is Guido Sanchez, from the BLaH file you are about to delete, and
I was just pointing that out. Some boards, like Gramcracker in 708/312, make
entire fucking DIRECTORIES in the zipfile. Annoying ones with lotsa alt-255s.
And that fucking annoying ţ. Is that the size of their asshole or their brain?
Well, in either case, I'd like to find out so I can skewer them using the
proper utensils. I mean, it would be a shame to want to give someone an iron
colonic, and you find out their asshole is bigger than you thought. And me
without my spoon.

    16                Are there others that -- psychological

    17    stress.  Others?

    18                DR. LARSON:  The viral fighters were

    19    mentioned. The smoke.  Don mentioned something.


    20                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Don, was the --

    21                Well, the -- the environmental exposure,

    22    certainly.


    23                DR. TAYLOR:  And that would include, I

    24    think, some of the things that we don't necessarily

    25    think of environmentally, with reference to their


                                                                        141

     1    living area.  The kerosene use, use of the heaters. 


     2    And I think we should --

     3                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Yes.  I think living

     4    conditions, sand, particulates.

     5                DR. TAYLOR:  Right.  Particulates.  All of


     6    those should be included.

     7                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Kerosene.  All of the

     8    environmental possible exposures we would probably


     9    want a scientific panel of experts.

    10                Now, some of these -- we're looking at

    11    actual members from DOD, VA, certainly in clinical

    12    care, but -- well, let's run down them a little bit


    13    and talk about the kinds of people we're looking and

    14    what would be official and where we would look for

    15    other scientific expertise.


    16                In the clinical care, we want to hear from

    17    the physicians, the VA physicians, and the DOD

    18    physicians, who have been actively involved in the

    19    care of veterans.  But in addition, we wanted to hear,


    20    I believe, from some of the other physicians who have

    21    been caring for veterans.

    22                Rolando, you had some physicians in Texas


    23    who wanted to present.

    24                We had some referred to yesterday at the

    25    hearing.  And I would think we would want to hear from


                                                                        142

     1    some of them.


     2                Are there other thoughts along that line?

     3                Art?

     4                DR. CAPLAN:  We just wanted to make sure

     5    that we had the nursing allied health input.  And


     6    there are people in rehab now --

     7                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Yes.

     8                DR. CAPLAN:  That are doing that.


     9                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  We would want to hear

    10    from some of those of the special referral centers.

    11                DR. CAPLAN:  Right.

    12                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  That are doing some


    13    of that work.  So, you know, that could be a session,

    14    a day or more in itself just to deal with these

    15    various clinical aspects -- be the subject of one


    16    whole meeting.

    17                Okay.  And the biologics, I would think we

    18    would want to get some of the national experts in

    19    vaccine and the vaccine development.


    20                We would want staff to do some background

    21    work for us and get as much facts as we can about

    22    where the vaccine is manufactured and how it --


    23    whether it's similar to what is used by other troops,

    24    a point you raised, John.

    25                And then we want some of the infectious


                                                                        143

     1    disease experts in the country to tell us what we know


     2    about these vaccines and how they have been used

     3    before and so forth.

     4                Anything else on that score?

     5                (No response.)


     6                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Okay.  On chemical

     7    warfare we have discussed the issues that we want

     8    there.  We are bringing someone on full time on the


     9    staff who will be doing thorough review of all the

    10    material available and we'll be guided by staff

    11    reports to us -- and then decide later, and by the

    12    subcommittee work.


    13                DR. RIOS:  Let me see if I understand

    14    this.  Is that going to be a different committee or a

    15    different set of hearings from the environmental


    16    exposure?

    17                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Yes.  I would think

    18    that chemical warfare is separate -- well, it's a

    19    separate issue from environmental exposure.  They are


    20    looking at different things.  It may be the same

    21    subcommittee.  They are both environmental.  But it's

    22    a particular issue in that area.


    23                DR. RIOS:  Okay.

    24                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  It may well be that

    25    we cover both at the same meeting.  That would be


                                                                        144

     1    logical.


     2                DR. TAYLOR:  Right.

     3                DR. BALDESCHWIELER:  And don't forget the

     4    prophylactic drug issue.

     5                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Oh, yes. 


     6    Prophylactic drugs.

     7                Be sure to push your mic.

     8                DR. TAYLOR:  Prophylactic drug use goes


     9    with the vaccines that they were --

    10                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Yes.  When we do the

    11    pyridostigmine bromide.  We can decide how to group

    12    these and what's the best ones to do at the same


    13    meeting and which ones go with others.  But I think

    14    maybe we could leave that to staff and myself to work

    15    on.


    16                Then the infectious disease aspect -- that

    17    might be combined with the biologic immunization work.

    18                David, how would you like to see us and

    19    what kind of panels would you like to see us pull


    20    together in the psychological stress factors?

    21                DR. HAMBURG:  Well, in principle, the same

    22    -- use the same kind of criteria as for the other


    23    problem areas.  There have been -- for example, right

    24    after the Gulf War, the National Institutes of Mental

    25    Health put out a request for proposals, and they have


                                                                        145

     1    stimulated quite a number of research studies.


     2                They are underway around the country.  I

     3    think we should find out from NIMH who are the leading

     4    investigators in this field and get people who are

     5    really at the frontier on the different facets of


     6    stress response.  Plus, we should probably tap into

     7    the basic research community on neuroendocrine

     8    relations.


     9                DR. TAYLOR:  The American Public Health

    10    Association has a sort of a psychological stress

    11    group.  And they are planning a big conference.  I'm

    12    not certain if it's this year or the following year.


    13                Bob Karasek, Jeffrey Johnson from Johns

    14    Hopkins -- there are quite a few folks in the field

    15    who are doing work on psychological stress.  So we may


    16    want to tap into what they are doing and find out.

    17                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  In all these areas,

    18    you know, as you go home and think about them all, if

    19    you identify any experts that you personally know in


    20    an area that you think would be key for a panel,

    21    please let staff know.  Feed that back regularly.

    22                Art?


    23                DR. CAPLAN:  This isn't actually about

    24    substance, it's about process.  And I just wanted to

    25    get this in before I leave.  Just two comments.


                                                                        146

     1                One is I think we should let people know,


     2    when we have expert panels, that we are certainly

     3    willing to take written materials in in terms of

     4    asking questions about what was said or things for us

     5    to ask about.  I don't mind being open to what anyone


     6    out there wants to raise for us to ask.

     7                And I think it should be -- I joked before

     8    about an 800 number -- but I think we need some


     9    mechanism -- if we say we are going to have a hearing

    10    on X and someone wants to send in a question and say,

    11    ""Why don't you ask them about Y?"" -- when you get to

    12    the hearing, they should have a place to do that.


    13                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Yes.

    14                DR. CAPLAN:  It just seems to me that we

    15    can be open.  We don't have to be the sole source of


    16    every question that is out there.  And it seems to me

    17    too that it would be useful for us in looking for even

    18    comments about themes and topics to be open to

    19    suggestions as well.


    20                So what I'm saying is as we make the

    21    agenda up, I have the correct thoughts, but I don't

    22    mind hearing from other people in the world who might


    23    have other thoughts.

    24                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  It's a point well

    25    taken.  And, you know, I think it was clear this


                                                                        147

     1    morning as we identified some of these issues -- they


     2    were clearly based on what we heard yesterday.

     3                And some areas we intend to explore are

     4    merely in response to those comments.  And in that

     5    same spirit, we will certainly be open.  I hope


     6    everyone at this point has the address for the office

     7    and would urge that all communications be addressed to

     8    Dr. Nishimi, who is the chief of staff, the executive


     9    staff director for the Committee.  The address of the

    10    Committee is 1411 K Street, N.W.  And the zip is --

    11                DR. NISHIMI:  Two, zero, zero, zero, five

    12    dash three, four, zero, four (20005-3404).  Suite


    13    1000.

    14                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Okay.

    15                John?


    16                DR. BALDESCHWIELER:  I wondered if

    17    epidemiology will be on your list of major issues?

    18                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Well, certainly the -

    19    - that's right.  We did say that one of the first


    20    things we'd be doing would be to look at all the

    21    recommendations that have been made and whether they

    22    have been implemented.


    23                And we'll certainly be having a full

    24    hearing around that issue as the staff get that work. 

    25    And key among that will be the recommendations for the


                                                                        148

     1    epidemiologic studies, the issues we raised this


     2    morning and yesterday, the comparability of the

     3    different epidemiologic studies that have been

     4    started.

     5                And I think getting some other


     6    epidemiologists to testify after they have reviewed

     7    that's planned would be worthwhile.

     8                Other things we need to flag for future


     9    hearings?

    10                (No response.)

    11                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Okay.  Well, I think

    12    we've covered that.  Now, the question of


    13    subcommittees.  I wonder if maybe the most efficient

    14    way is to -- for me to just go around the table and

    15    for each of you to indicate the areas you'd be most


    16    interested in working on if we develop subcommittees.

    17                And how we develop them and the timing of

    18    them and so on will depend on further staff analysis

    19    of how fast we get our various staff on and how


    20    quickly they can go through the material that's

    21    already in existence.

    22                But, Andrea --


    23                DR. TAYLOR:  My interest, I guess, is the

    24    environmental exposure, exposure assessment area

    25    regarding -- from chemical warfare to some of the


                                                                        149

     1    other exposures that we've talked about earlier.


     2                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Fine.

     3                Rolando?

     4                DR. RIOS:  My interest would also be in

     5    chemical and biological warfare and the environmental


     6    exposure issues.

     7                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Elaine?

     8                DR. LARSON:  Infectious diseases and the


     9    clinical systems issues.

    10                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Marguerite?

    11                DR. KNOX:  Are you lumping the

    12    pyridostigmine under the clinical -- the anthrax and


    13    that under the clinical?  Or is that environmental?

    14                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  That's a good

    15    question.  It crosses all boundaries, doesn't it? 


    16    It's involved with both.  You are interested in it,

    17    clearly.

    18                DR. KNOX:  Right.  And also the ethical

    19    issues.


    20                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  And the ethical

    21    issues.  Fine.

    22                DR. HAMBURG:  From your list of seven, I


    23    guess I would do either research or clinical care or

    24    implementation of past recommendations.  And -- either

    25    one of those.


                                                                        150

     1                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Okay.


     2                Don?

     3                DR. CUSTIS:  Clinical care and infectious

     4    diseases.  Are you going to have the staff handle the

     5    implementation of past recommendations?  Or is that


     6    also --

     7                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  I think that will be

     8    one staff will do most of the initial work on and


     9    we'll have complete hearings around.  I doubt that

    10    we'll do that one in subcommittee.  But I don't know. 

    11    But if so, we'll put it down.

    12                DR. CUSTIS:  I have some particular


    13    interest in some of those recommendations.

    14                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Right.

    15                DR. CUSTIS:  I think clinical care and


    16    infectious diseases.

    17                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Fine.

    18                DR. CAPLAN:  I am interested in the --

    19    wherever the anthrax and prophylactic agents go.  And


    20    I am interested in clinical care.

    21                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  And, John, you are

    22    the natural --


    23                DR. BALDESCHWIELER:  I think I would

    24    follow all those things with the molecular basis,

    25    including chemical and biological warfare, the


                                                                        151

     1    environmental exposures, prophylactic drugs,


     2    immunization, and the assays for the infectious

     3    diseases.

     4                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Fine.  Thanks.

     5                Well, you can see why we were all


     6    selected.  We really do cover the waterfront.  And I

     7    think that's a good way to get about.  I guess, then,

     8    there's the question of what we think the priorities


     9    ought to be, the order in which we might be taking

    10    these up.

    11                For staff, the first priority will be

    12    gathering the data on all the previous


    13    recommendations, previous reports, getting that

    14    analyzed, and beginning to find out, and tracking that

    15    material.  My guess is they won't be ready to report


    16    on that for a couple of months.

    17                Robyn, let me turn that part to you.

    18                DR. NISHIMI:  I would say not in

    19    September.  But I think we can start, you know, laying


    20    out a framework, certainly, by October, put together

    21    that typology, you know, have started the interview

    22    process of departments as well as the end users.


    23                But certainly, the typology could

    24    presumably be completed by October and some

    25    preliminary information gathering be presented to the


                                                                        152

     1    Committee.


     2                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Okay.

     3                Any questions on that?  And we can aim for

     4    that for an October session.

     5                (No response.)


     6                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  What would be our

     7    next priority we would like to see addressed?  Does it

     8    matter to us?  Or should we wait and see how staff are


     9    moving on all these areas and --

    10                DR. LARSON:  Using your criterion that you

    11    discussed before lunch -- and that is, what do we want

    12    to put in that first six-month report --


    13                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Yes.

    14                DR. LARSON:  That interim report.  Clearly

    15    we need to be finished with reviewing the


    16    recommendations.  And then it -- maybe the next

    17    priority might have something to do with if there are

    18    problems of access, waiting times, clinical issues.

    19                We know that the research studies are


    20    beginning to get going.  Perhaps the next thing to do

    21    is to address some of those things that might hinder

    22    the rest of the progress --


    23                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Yes.

    24                DR. LARSON:  Of inquiry.  So we might want

    25    to focus on getting those focus groups started and


                                                                        153

     1    getting -- looking at the clinical groups.  And we had


     2    also talked before lunch about the possibility on

     3    these panels of patients.  Now, that may be a

     4    different panel.

     5                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Well -- oh, that's


     6    right.  We wanted to come back to the question of

     7    hearings around the country.

     8                DR. LARSON:  Yes.


     9                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  And I think those

    10    will be the kind of hearings, like we had yesterday

    11    afternoon, that we might hold in different spots

    12    around the country.  But I think staff will have to do


    13    research as to where the concentration of vets are.

    14                And I guess the issue for us is whether

    15    those need to be the full Committee, or, we hold some


    16    regional hearings with two, three, four

    17    representatives of the Committee at each one of the

    18    hearings.

    19                DR. LARSON:  Well, that's one issue.  And


    20    then, the other issue is we talked about doing some

    21    case studies walking through the system.

    22                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  That's right.


    23                DR. LARSON:  For what happens when someone

    24    enters the system as an active duty person or as a new

    25    veteran in the VA system.  And just walking through


                                                                        154

     1    that system with them as a case study.


     2                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Yes.

     3                DR. LARSON:  Which is a little different

     4    than the focus groups --

     5                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Yes.


     6                DR. LARSON:  And the individual hearings.

     7                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Right.  Right.

     8                DR. LARSON:  And I would suggest that we


     9    might want to do that sooner rather than later to

    10    approach some of the clinical systems problems.

    11                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Is that possible,

    12    Robyn?


    13                DR. NISHIMI:  Sure.  I mean, we start on

    14    all of these initially.  But I think in terms of what

    15    one can begin to do immediately in the near term to


    16    gather these facets --

    17                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Right.

    18                DR. NISHIMI:  For, certainly, the field

    19    hearings because that's the type of thing where you'll


    20    be able to get immediate impact.

    21                So I do think that if the Committee could,

    22    you know, reach some kind of sense of whether they


    23    want to do this as a full Committee or whether they

    24    feel that subcommittees of some combination or

    25    combinations is adequate is an important thing for us


                                                                        155

     1    to settle today.


     2                DR. LARSON:  Maybe one way to approach it

     3    with the case studies is to use the same format and

     4    then have it again.

     5                We could do more if we did in two or three


     6    groups a similar case study in a different -- like at

     7    lunch, you were saying, Don, that each VA is

     8    different.


     9                There is a wide quality and spectrum of

    10    care across the VAs depending on whether they are

    11    associated with academic health centers or out in a

    12    community or whatever.  So we might want to select --


    13                DR. CUSTIS:  You shouldn't quote me.

    14                DR. LARSON:  Well, I'll quote myself then. 

    15    They are different.  But anyway, it might be nice to


    16    have more than one of those case studies.

    17                DR. CAPLAN:  One thing we could do is

    18    agree, I think, that it would be good to have small

    19    groups going out to these hearings because we'll get


    20    more information and we'll give more people the

    21    opportunity to talk to us.  We'll just be able to

    22    cover more of a big country.


    23                So I would strongly come down on the side

    24    of two or three person subcommittees trying to do this

    25    in different parts of the country, giving people


                                                                        156

     1    access who can't get to Washington.  It's too


     2    expensive.  They are too sick.  Whatever.

     3                And I would also like to urge that if we

     4    are going to get ready for that, we need one other

     5    thing, which is a kind of succinct summary of what


     6    people are supposed to be entitled to for clinical

     7    care, legally and otherwise.

     8                What are they supposed to get?  What were


     9    they promised?  What was supposed to be delivered? 

    10    That should certainly inform some standard set of

    11    questions, whether in a case study format or just --

    12                And I had another thought, which is in


    13    addition to doing a case study walk-through.  If we

    14    could, instead of asking people to simply testify to

    15    us, sort of hanging out the shingle and saying, ""We're


    16    here.  We've come to your town.  Here we are.""  If we

    17    could come up with a list of questions and say we want

    18    you to tell us about A, B, and C, that will move it

    19    along for us too.  


    20                I mean, I don't mean to just limit it to

    21    what we want to know about, but we certainly could

    22    suggest as part of --


    23                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Their testimony that

    24    they address certain issues that --

    25                DR. CAPLAN:  Their testimony, these are


                                                                        157

     1    key themes that we are interested in.


     2                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Good point.  We'll

     3    note that.

     4                Okay.  Any other -- I sense a consensus of

     5    the group that we try to get those going in the fall,


     6    maybe use September, October --

     7                DR. LARSON:  But we may be talking about

     8    two different things.  I mean, you are talking about


     9    hearings.  I was talking about case -- where you

    10    actually look at -- okay, here is where you entered

    11    the system, and here's how.

    12                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Yes.


    13                DR. LARSON:  And then on X date, Y date,

    14    here's what happened, here's the test that occurred.

    15                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Yes.


    16                DR. LARSON:  Here's the symptoms.  You

    17    know, just that kind of a walk-through.

    18                DR. BALDESCHWIELER:  For a specific

    19    person?


    20                DR. LARSON:  Yes.

    21                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Yes.  Yes.  We would

    22    identify some specific people.  We'll have to stave


    23    off the work on the logistics.  We could combine that

    24    with the small hearings at the same time -- that we

    25    are having a small hearing somewhere, have a case


                                                                        158

     1    study also from that area, that region, that VA.


     2                DR. NISHIMI:  I think you have to be --

     3    we'll have to be careful about privacy considerations.

     4                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Privacy.

     5                DR. RIOS:  I was going to mention that it


     6    -- there may be some privacy problems.  Plus it also

     7    seems like it could be something done by staff.  If

     8    you get somebody and you find out what their complaint


     9    was, where it started, and what happened.

    10                I mean, that's just -- sounds like

    11    something that staff could work up.  I don't know how

    12    many cases you want to look at just to see what


    13    happened.  It doesn't seem like it's something

    14    conducive to having hearings on.  I don't know.

    15                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  No.  I think it was


    16    separate from the hearings.

    17                DR. LARSON:  Two separate issues.

    18                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  That was the thought.

    19                DR. LARSON:  And in fact --


    20                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Of this whole --

    21                DR. LARSON:  I wonder if the hearings is

    22    not better served at this point by focus groups.  I


    23    don't know.  I mean, we are talking about three things

    24    now.

    25                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  I think they are


                                                                        159

     1    different.  They're three different things.


     2                DR. LARSON:  Right.

     3                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  One would be

     4    individual case studies.

     5                DR. LARSON:  Right.


     6                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  And we'll have to

     7    determine -- I think we'll need some staff work to

     8    determine how to select those and what the exact


     9    specifics.  Regional hearings are for those veterans

    10    who wish to be heard by this Committee, who have not

    11    been able to come here.

    12                DR. LARSON:  Yes.


    13                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Focus groups will be

    14    an order sample, a more representative sample of Gulf

    15    War veterans to explore the issues that have come up


    16    as part of the process and the studies.  And we will

    17    do all three.

    18                Is that -- is that the consensus of what

    19    I've heard here?


    20                DR. LARSON:  Right.

    21                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Okay.  Well, to me it

    22    sounds like then that by our October meeting we'll be


    23    able to get the initial recommendations issues.  We

    24    would get started on some of the case studies,

    25    possibly, and some of the hearings.


                                                                        160

     1                The actual focus groups would not be held


     2    by then.  That's more complicated until we select a

     3    firm and identify that.  But we could develop the next

     4    meeting -- and we'll have to talk about the frequency

     5    of meetings -- but the meeting after the October


     6    meeting, around the clinical care issues, and focus on

     7    clinical care.

     8                Maybe that's as far as we ought to go in


     9    trying to set priorities until we see where staff are. 

    10    There's too much that needs to be done and too many

    11    unanswered questions.

    12                DR. NISHIMI:  Yes.  I think so.


    13                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  I think --

    14                DR. NISHIMI:  That's all we are going to

    15    get done before the report is due, the six-month.  If


    16    we had an October meeting and then another one in

    17    December or whatever, the report's due in early

    18    February, right?

    19                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Mid-February.


    20                DR. NISHIMI:  So it'll either be December

    21    or January.  I don't think we are going to get more

    22    than two more meetings in before then.  So if we've


    23    decided those two are our priorities, we can deal with

    24    those before February.

    25                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Well, that brings us


                                                                        161

     1    to the frequency of meetings.  Are we aiming for


     2    monthly?  Bimonthly?  I can see everyone voting at

     3    different times.  And what's realistic?

     4                DR. NISHIMI:  I think you also have to

     5    think about the fact that you are going to have these


     6    smaller group field hearings.  So, you know, when you

     7    commit to a -- either, you know, every four weeks, six

     8    weeks, eight weeks schedule, remember that there will


     9    be subgroups of you also taking on the responsibility,

    10    you know, at some point in between those meetings of

    11    convening for a separate small gathering.

    12                DR. TAYLOR:  On that note --


    13                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  What is the

    14    preference?  On that note, what would you like to say?

    15                DR. TAYLOR:  Bimonthly.  Every other


    16    month.

    17                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Every other month?

    18                DR. LARSON:  Whatever it takes to get the

    19    work done.


    20                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  To get the work done.

    21                DR. LARSON:  Yes.

    22                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Well, let us see. 


    23    We've asked you for calendars.  Those have been

    24    distributed.  We'll have a sense by the October

    25    meeting.  And maybe we'll leave this open to see and


                                                                        162

     1    see what we can do in the --


     2                DR. CAPLAN:  What I'd like to suggest,

     3    maybe, is that we could presume that we are going to

     4    meet at least bimonthly.

     5                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Yes.


     6                DR. CAPLAN:  So we could set those in now.

     7                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Okay.  Well, we won't

     8    take this time to set the calendar.  But staff will be


     9    back in touch with you all.

    10                DR. CAPLAN:  Well --

    11                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  All of you have in

    12    the book a calendar with x's in there already, which


    13    are my x's out.  Some are wrong.  And I've corrected

    14    them.

    15                DR. BALDESCHWIELER:  It's extremely


    16    helpful to at least --

    17                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Yes.  I think as many

    18    as we can do ahead --

    19                DR. BALDESCHWIELER:  Schedule ahead --


    20                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  And just say if we

    21    could set the bimonthly for the whole year, and then

    22    if we need additionals, fit them in and do


    23    subcommittees.  That would be helpful.

    24                Okay.  Are there any other --

    25                Robyn reminds me that in the environmental


                                                                        163

     1    that includes the depleted uranium issue as well.  And


     2    -- okay.  I am open now for anything else any member

     3    of the Committee wants to raise at this point.  Issues

     4    we've missed.  Additions.  Suggestions.

     5                Andrea?


     6                DR. TAYLOR:  Yes.  Our next meeting I note

     7    thus far is the week of October 16th.  So then, we

     8    don't have the dates yet?


     9                DR. NISHIMI:  No.  Because we don't even

    10    have all the responses in.  But that was what was sort

    11    of looking good.  Although I got a few more yesterday. 

    12    And so maybe now it's toward -- anyway -- some time --


    13                DR. RIOS:  That's going to be here?

    14                DR. NISHIMI:  Well, that's for the

    15    Committee to decide.


    16                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Yes.  That's one of

    17    the questions, is how frequently we meet in

    18    Washington.  How frequently do you want to come to

    19    California?  And whether we ever meet somewhere else


    20    in between.  If we do subcommittee hearings around the

    21    country, there's less need for the whole Committee to

    22    move west.  And you are heavily eastern loaded.  But


    23    John and I do live in California.

    24                DR. KNOX:  I think most of the Gulf War

    25    veterans did come from the east.  I don't want to make


                                                                        164

     1    that too big of a statement.  But I think a lot of


     2    them were from the East because it was closer.

     3                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Today, I mean for

     4    this hearing, but then there are others from around

     5    the country.


     6                DR. KNOX:  Oh, right.  Right.

     7                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  That might want to

     8    attend the full meeting as well as be present at the


     9    hearing.

    10                DR. KNOX:  Right.

    11                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  So I think we

    12    shouldn't have all of the meetings in Washington.  We


    13    clearly have to have some in other cities to give

    14    other people beside the hearings a chance to actually

    15    sit through a full meeting.


    16                DR. RIOS:  Did you say the -- most of the

    17    troops that went to the Gulf War were from the east

    18    coast?

    19                DR. KNOX:  I think a majority of the


    20    troops that went into the Gulf War were on this side

    21    of the United States.  And simply because it was

    22    easier to transport them from the east coast than it


    23    was from the west coast.

    24                DR. RIOS:  It may have been -- they may

    25    have been stationed on the east coast, but they are


                                                                        165

     1    not from the east coast.


     2                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  John?

     3                DR. BALDESCHWIELER:  I would like to raise

     4    what is a complex and confusing issue of economics and

     5    ethics.  And that is, presumably if this panel and the


     6    Administration responds to recommendations to improve

     7    the care and the access of this group of veterans --

     8    if one is dealing with the zero sum game, that means


     9    that somebody else gets less care.

    10                That is, if the system is conserved in

    11    terms of resources and facilities.  I suppose that is

    12    not in our charter, but somehow it seems to me utterly


    13    essential that one understand just how the dynamics of

    14    the system will respond to recommendations that we

    15    make.


    16                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  I think that's

    17    something that we may want to talk about when we come

    18    to final recommendations, as to costs of

    19    recommendations and prioritizing them in some way. 


    20    But final decisions of how governmental resources are

    21    allocated remains in the hands of the President and

    22    the Congress, through the appropriation processes and


    23    many others.  But these are issues that I think we'll

    24    have to address downstream.

    25                The immediate issues for us are our own


                                                                        166

     1    budget, and that we live within that budget.  Which


     2    may put constraints on how many hearings where, how

     3    much travel and so on.  And staff is going to have to

     4    struggle with that a little bit with me as we --

     5                DR. BALDESCHWIELER:  But the frequent


     6    outcome of recommendations of this sort is a, in a

     7    sense, an unfunded mandate.  The system is asked to do

     8    something.  And those resources come from somewhere


     9    else.  And then you succeed in shifting the problem. 

    10    But not necessarily making an overall improvement.

    11                DR. CUSTIS:  Unfunded mandates are very

    12    popular.  It's an imponderable.


    13                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  It's an imponderable. 

    14    I'm not sure how fruitful it is for us to discuss that

    15    at any length, but --


    16                Elaine?

    17                DR. LARSON:  No.  I was just going to

    18    suggest that first we need to lay out the issues and

    19    see where we are.  And then, I agree with you.  The


    20    final recommendations -- it might be something we need

    21    to -- it will be something we will address in terms of

    22    prioritization and so forth.


    23                In terms of deciding where our meetings

    24    are, I am wondering if it might be helpful to first

    25    have -- just talk about whether -- where we might,


                                                                        167

     1    what might be logical places to have hearings based on


     2    the location of where we might get more information,

     3    more vets, and also where we are located around the

     4    country.

     5                And then maybe a simple way to do it with


     6    the Committee is to at least every third meeting, if

     7    not every other, reverse coasts or go across and back. 

     8    I don't  know.


     9                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Well, I -- it's a

    10    question of whether that's worth our exploring that

    11    more here, or we need staff to do some more work on

    12    this --


    13                DR. LARSON:  That's fine.  Yes.

    14                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  And find out where

    15    some key spots --


    16                DR. LARSON:  It sounds fine.

    17                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  -- that we need to be

    18    and so on.

    19                DR. NISHIMI:  Yes.  I mean, I think


    20    because it wouldn't be very fruitful here for us to --

    21    all the data points aren't here.  But we also have to

    22    have financial considerations, quite frankly, taken


    23    into account.

    24                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  It's not only our

    25    trouble, it's staff trouble as well.


                                                                        168

     1                David?


     2                DR. HAMBURG:  Joyce, on the process of the

     3    near term, it's been pretty easy for me and others

     4    today to say the staff will do this and the staff will

     5    do that, except we don't have much staff yet.


     6                These kinds of operations begin with a

     7    desk and a pencil.  When you start from ground zero,

     8    it's not as if you had an established institution. 


     9    You turn to the established institution to do a study.

    10                You create an institution in a sense, a

    11    transitory one to be blown away at the end of next

    12    year.  But in the meantime, how do you get up and


    13    running expeditiously?

    14                And in effect, we are piling on

    15    suggestions for a non-existent staff to do.  I think


    16    we need to focus on how we get a staff in place of the

    17    right calibre as rapidly as possible.

    18                I think one part of that, quite frankly,

    19    is an intensive interaction between the chair and the


    20    staff director in the next few weeks.  A very

    21    intensive one.  If you had any thoughts of doing

    22    anything else, I suspect they'll soon evaporate.


    23                But more than that, I believe we ought to

    24    volunteer -- I think every member of the Committee

    25    would want to be helpful to the extent you want to


                                                                        169

     1    involve us in identifying people or helping to assess


     2    or recruit people to join the staff as soon as

     3    possible.

     4                You might also want to consider some

     5    flexibility, some first-rate people who are not


     6    available full time  might be available half time in

     7    the near future, something of that sort.  We ought to

     8    be open to that.


     9                It's more important to get the right sort

    10    of people, with the competence and the integrity and

    11    so on, than it is to have them in any particular

    12    arrangement, in my judgement.


    13                In any event, I am volunteering for the

    14    Committee to help the Chair to work this out to get

    15    the staff up and running as soon as possible.


    16                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Thank you, David.  I

    17    appreciate that.  And I welcome that help.  Robyn and

    18    I have been in almost daily contact since the end of

    19    June, I guess, around staffing issues.  We are -- I


    20    think have made amazing progress for how short.

    21                But there are a lot of positions unfilled

    22    at this point.  It might be helpful for Robyn to run


    23    down and give you a brief description of the people

    24    who are on board and the areas that we are still

    25    searching very hard for and elicit you to help.


                                                                        170

     1                Robyn, would you like to do that?


     2                Okay.

     3                DR. NISHIMI:  There's myself, the

     4    executive director.  We have a deputy director and a

     5    counsel, Holly Gwin, who has been doing all of -- most


     6    of the logistics for the meeting.

     7                There will need to be some type of senior

     8    medical advisor.  And I believe we have already


     9    identified a person who has familiarity with the

    10    policy world, military health, veterans' health,

    11    clinical issues, bioethics, a lot of experience.

    12                A director of communications, obviously,


    13    is important.  And we are, I think, close to achieving

    14    closure on that.  The same with the congressional and

    15    public affairs coordinator to work with the director


    16    of communications.

    17                There will be sort of a medical veterans'

    18    military ombudsperson that Joyce has previously

    19    mentioned.  And we have a couple of people in line


    20    there.

    21                And then we are looking at, you know, what

    22    I would call the policy analysts, senior policy


    23    analysts, across a range of issues, clinical care, the

    24    ones we've been discussing.  Clinical care.  Research. 

    25    Hazard and risk assessment.  Outreach.  Implementation


                                                                        171

     1    of the past recommendations.


     2                And they would fill out the analytic

     3    staff.  And we have identified people for many of

     4    those positions.  Some of them are still being

     5    interviewed.  Some of them -- their papers are being


     6    processed.

     7                And then a couple of research assistants. 

     8    The administrative staff is pretty much in place,


     9    except for probably a contractor to help with the

    10    archival material and things like that.

    11                DR. LARSON:  Did -- were you clear on --

    12    or, I'm not clear on what our priorities are -- our


    13    priority needs are, based on that?

    14                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Priority needs, I

    15    believe, are in epidemiology and --


    16                DR. NISHIMI:  Well, in epidemiology we

    17    have a strong candidate now identified that we were

    18    following up on.  On the psychological factors, Dr.

    19    Hamburg has, I think, discussed that with Dr. Lashof.


    20                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  He's going to before

    21    he leaves today.

    22                DR. NISHIMI:  Or, he's going to.  Clinical


    23    care, we have a physician and then another possible

    24    part-time consultant physician.  But I think it would

    25    be also important to look into, as Art indicated, some


                                                                        172

     1    of the allied health professionals, perhaps full time,


     2    perhaps not, to assist in going out and evaluating

     3    both the DOD and the VA care systems.

     4                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Did -- wouldn't we

     5    feel that we would like to find a nurse who could help


     6    us in this area and could look at some of the

     7    healthcare and medical care issues?  And that's one we

     8    haven't identified.  And the outreach we have. 


     9    Otherwise, we are in reasonable shape, actually. 

    10    We've been hard at work.

    11                Okay.  Others?  Other issues? 

    12    Suggestions?  Things we need to cover before we --


    13                (No response.)

    14                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  If not, we did have

    15    a request earlier today that there were some veterans


    16    who wished to testify yesterday who did not have an

    17    opportunity.  And I said that if we had time at the

    18    end of today's session before we had to adjourn, I

    19    would grant them time.


    20                If they would identify themselves?

    21                Let me take a five minute break and ask

    22    anyone who wishes to so testify to come forward and


    23    identify themselves to Robyn?  You, or?

    24                DR. NISHIMI:  No.  I am looking for --

    25                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Diane's over there.


                                                                        173

     1                DR. NISHIMI:  No.  Is Mike Kowalek here? 


     2    Or is he out front?

     3                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Okay.  Let us take a

     4    couple-minute break.  And we'll have someone to

     5    identify anyone who wishes to testify.  And we should


     6    be able to wrap up in the next 20 minutes.

     7                (Whereupon, the proceedings went off the

     8                record at 2:16 p.m. and went back on the


     9                record at 2:31 p.m.)

    10                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  I think we'll resume. 

    11    I was approached this morning and informed that there

    12    were some people that wanted to testify.  But it does


    13    not appear that we've been able to -- we have.  Okay.

    14                We're waiting to try and see if we have

    15    identified -- there is one person who wishes to


    16    testify.

    17                The name is Diane St. Julian, I believe. 

    18    Will she come forward now to the mic.  We'll be happy

    19    to hear her.


    20                We may need to lower the mic.  They

    21    clearly need to lower the mic. for you.  We'll do

    22    that.  Just wait one minute.


    23                The floor is yours.

    25    is Diane St. Julian.  And I am reading a statement on

     3          my country in the United States Army for

     4          over nine years, during which time I have

     5          been awarded for outstanding service on


     6          numerous occasions.

    17          for predeployment and predeployment plans

     8          as an escort to the ground troop

     5          pill, I could not find any record of


     6          them; secondly, because after questioning

     7          numerous doctors about such a pill, none

    16                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Thank you very much. 

    17    Just for the record, I'd like to clarify that you were

    18    reading a statement from --

    19                MRS. ST. JULIAN:  Jeffrey St. Julian.


    20                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  St. Julian.

    21                MRS. ST. JULIAN:  Yes.

    22                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  I see.  And you are?


    23                MRS. ST. JULIAN:  Diane St. Julian.

    24                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  And you are Diane St.

    25    Julian.


                                                                        182

     1                MRS. ST. JULIAN:  Yes.


     2                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  So that you were

     3    reading the statement on behalf of your husband?

     4                MRS. ST. JULIAN:  Yes.

     5                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  I understand that


     6    now.

     7                MRS. ST. JULIAN:  Okay.

     8                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  I wasn't clear on


     9    that, and I wanted that clear for the record.

    10                MRS. ST. JULIAN:  Okay.

    11                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Thank you very much.

    12                MRS. ST. JULIAN:  Okay.


    13                DR. TAYLOR:  One question, Diane?

    14                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Oh, yes.  Questions.

    15                DR. TAYLOR:  Diane, you said that he


    16    received the vaccines?  In his statement, he said that

    17    he had received a vaccine but never served in the

    18    Gulf.  So he received some of the similar shots that

    19    many of the other veterans --


    20                MRS. ST. JULIAN:  Yes.  He received all

    21    the vaccines.  He was even loaded on the plane to go,

    22    with bags and everything, and then was told to stand


    23    down.

    24                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Are there any other

    25    questions.


                                                                        183

     1                (No response.)


     2                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  If not, thank you

     3    very much.

     4                MRS. ST. JULIAN:  Okay.  Thank you.

     5                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  I think before we


     6    close we had one request from one of the Gulf War

     7    Veterans.  Denise Nichols would like to make just a

     8    few remarks about her reactions to the day and a half,


     9    almost two days.

    10                MS. NICHOLS:  It's awfully low here.

    11                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Denise, I will ask

    12    you to be brief because we must return promptly --


    13                MS. NICHOLS:  It will be brief.

    14                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  And I do have a few

    15    more minor business things to cover.


    16                MS. NICHOLS:  We want to make a couple of

    17    statements.  First of all, we appreciate the

    18    dedication that you've shown.  And you've picked up on

    19    some of our concerns.  We do hope we have some


    20    communication with the staff as you go along.

    21                I want to mention that we have had quite

    22    a few deaths.  And we have different figures.  And we


    23    hope that if you get those death data that you can

    24    help facilitate the release of that so recognition for

    25    these soldiers and the troops can be started.


                                                                        184

     1                I think they need to be recognized in some


     2    way.  Col. Kline is one example.  And I would like to

     3    move that forward so that those families have some

     4    recognition.  I want to stress again that time is very

     5    definitely a factor.


     6                A lot of the vets feel like their time is

     7    short, that they are dying.  And so I hope that even

     8    though your final report is not due until quite a ways


     9    away, that if you find data that will provide the

    10    answers, that you will communicate clearly with the

    11    troops.

    12                There was one thing that I was taught when


    13    I came into the military as an officer.  And I am

    14    retired now.  It was always said if you take care of

    15    the troops, they would take care of you.  We've done


    16    our duty.  We would like you to help us find the

    17    answers and get them addressed.

    18                We hope that you will also consider the

    19    base line data that a lot of troops didn't have.  Some


    20    of us do have base line data from before we went to

    21    war, with the physicals.  A lot of our records are

    22    missing.


    23                Some people being reservists guards might

    24    be able to provide some of that.  And it's never been

    25    asked for.  But one of the things I've seen is it may


                                                                        185

     1    not be abnormal lab results yet, but they are


     2    different from their base line.  They have changed

     3    over time.

     4                And I was always taught as a nurse to look

     5    at a base line first.  And it may not be abnormal yet. 


     6    But if it's changing, you need to watch it.  And it's

     7    an indicator.

     8                I want to stress that they have not been


     9    doing testing for depleted uranium.  And in a

    10    sandstorm situation, like we were in over there, with

    11    the weather factors and all, that we have great

    12    concern for the inhalation, ingestion, of depleted


    13    uranium.

    14                And we have not had any testing across the

    15    board for depleted uranium in our bodies, and heavy


    16    metals, and the lead that came out in one of the

    17    reports in the past.

    18                We also have not had sufficient testing

    19    for leishmaniasis and some of the endemic diseases


    20    that may be affecting the families and could be

    21    addressed quite quickly, I do believe.  I think those

    22    things that may affect the family we should put on a


    23    high priority -- would be our feed in because there's

    24    great concern for our family members out there.

    25                And in ending this, I would hope that --


                                                                        186

     1    we  heard the figures 58,000 on a registry.  I went to


     2    the Wall last night, stopped by early this morning --

     3    58,000 and something names on the Vietnam War.  And I

     4    hope that we are not looking at -- and delayed an

     5    expectant category of people that are looking to be


     6    not with us.  And I hope that that doesn't happen. 

     7    That would be a real tragedy for our nation.  And

     8    thank you for your sincerity.  And thank you for


     9    addressing some of our concerns from yesterday.

    10                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Thank you very much.

    11                We are about ready to close up.  I just

    12    have a couple of final things to say to the Committee


    13    and then to anyone in the audience who wants to

    14    approach anything.

    15                Over the next few days we'll be getting


    16    out to you follow-ups on some of the issues that we've

    17    discussed.  Robyn will be back in touch with you about

    18    dates and we'll try to resolve some of those.

    19                Again, the -- I wanted to make clear to


    20    any of the audience who wishes to submit any

    21    additional material to our office.  That is open

    22    throughout the duration of our study which runs to


    23    December 1996.

    24                I would urge you not to submit anything

    25    during the last month or two, but the sooner we get


                                                                        187

     1    additional information from you, the sooner we can


     2    address your concerns and look into it.

     3                This is not like a Congressional hearing

     4    where you only have ten days after the hearing to

     5    submit material.  Our office will be open to


     6    submissions from any veterans or any other concerned

     7    people who have information or data.

     8                Again, I'll give you the address of that


     9    office.  That's 1411 K Street, N.W., Suite 1000, and

    10    the zip code is 20005-3404.

    11                Thank you, Robyn.

    12                And if there are any other closing remarks


    13    any member of the Committee cares to make?

    14                (No response.)

    15                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  If not, I will turn


    16    the gavel over to Cathy Woteki, who officially opens

    17    and closes our meetings.

    18                MS. WOTEKI:  And as the designated federal

    19    official for the Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses


    20    Committee, you are now adjourned.

    21                (Whereupon, the Public Meeting of the

    22    Presidential Advisory Committee on Gulf War Veterans'


    23    Illnesses was adjourned at 2:49 p.m.)

raza1@gmail.com,science7.txt,"epartment of
Patent Rights in Los Angeles, California, where Dr. Chalfin of Cal-Tech
confirmed that:

     There does not exist an even distantly similar engine to this one
     in the world.  Conventional electric engines use up power.  In
     this system energy is used up for only a minute part of a
     millisecond.  It operates without heat loss and there is no
     energy loss whatsoever with this system"",

had more meaning to the PHILLIPS and others in Holland than to energy
establishments in his native America.

ENGLAND:  There is perhaps no more controversial inventor at this time than
John R. R. Searl and his Levity Disc, powered by the Searl Effect
Generator.  It is claimed that model craft have been demonstrated with
flight characteristics showing anti-gravitational and inertia-free
properties.  Demonstrations have been photographed and videotaped.  Searl
calls his generator a ""Gyro-Flywheel High Energy Density Mechanical Device""
and claims that the magnets used are not the common type, ordinary magnets.
The Australian engineer Athol Park of Melbourne, who visited Searl a few
years ago described it this way:

     ""From a briefcase, Mr. Searl takes a bar magnet and two steel
     rollers.  He places the rollers at either end of the magnet.
     They appear to be attracted to the poles - but, when they are
     pushed gently around the corners of the magnet, they chase each
     other round and round....""

The engineer quotes Searl:

     ""The crystal in the magnet are changed by putting it in a
     magnetic flux oven and by frequency control.  The result is
     motion of a magnetic field - a completely new source of power.
     Unis (modules) based on this principle are what power my
     levity unit - the motor and generator built as one, fuelless
     unit"".

In one of his numerous newsletters he states further:

     ""The power plant is a self-contained, onboard closed system of
      conversion elements with energy input from a latent storage source"".

Because Searl has never divulged all details and his explanations are
generally of a non-technical, ""unscientific"" nature, many investigators
have chosen to dismiss him as a swindler and imposter.  In sharp contrast
to this is the opinion of a well-experienced American engineer who reported
after a visit with Searl:

     ""I found it resfreshing to note the keen sense of moral respon-
     sibility which he feels for the use to which his discovery is
     put...  The Searls live in modest circumstances.  Luxuries are few.
     They do not own a car.  Mr. Searl bicycles several miles
     daily to his place of work in Maidenhead.  There he is an electrical
     technician and training supervisor in a bearing factory"".

But perhaps most significant was the following observation of the American
visitor about Searl:

     ""We were also interested to hear him say that many of his ideas
     came to him while he slept.  He would go to sleep with question, and
     wake with answers... and refreshed.  He seemed to have the
     ability to restore vital powers more quickly than most people"".

And the American concluded his report with the statement:

     ""The impression we gained of Mr. Searl was one of a very sincere
     and generous person, a dedicated and tireless worker with perfect
     confidence in the outcome of his efforts, a man of high principle
     with a keen sense of loyalty to those who are helping him, and of
     responsibility for the future welfare of our planet and its
     people"".

In view of the very contradictory nature of comments and impressions by
those who have met Searl, it might be wise to reverse final judgement on
the Searl-Levity-Disc and its inventor at this time.

NEW ZEALAND:  Some of Searl's keenest supporters and observers of his work
are in New Zealand and Australia.  And one of the sharpest young physicists
in that country (New Zealand), unhampered by calcified ideology, developed
the mathematical foundation for a theoretical anti-gravity effect, using
the hydrodynamic analogy of the ether.  He uses the equivalent of the
hydrodynamic Reynolds number, above a certain value of which the laminar
flow past a solid surface breaks down and becomes turbulent due to shear
rupture of the viscous cohesion of a fluid, together with his deduction
that anti-gravity could be obtained by creating a ""vacuum: in the ether in
such a way as to correspond to the production of turbulence in a magnetic
field.  Turbulence in a fluid occurs when Reynolds number RE = 1, when the
inertial shearing force equals the viscous cohesion force in the fluid in
the vicinity of an approximately spherical body immersed in the fluid,
resulting in separation of the boundary layer and formation of a wake i.e.
vacuum or free surface around the body.  He calculated the for turbulence
in the ether, = a vacuum = and anti-gravity effect, using the refined value
of ether kinematic viscosity which he obtained.

His theory would confirm the observations of very high voltage produced in
the case of the Searl Disc, and the very high voltage needed in the vacuum
experiments with flying disc-shaped bodies of T.T. Brown, the ionocraft
observations of Major de Seversky, the Electro-Field Rockets of Prof.
Dudley, the observations of Northrup Corp. with Electro-Aerodynamics in
Supersonic Flow and similar American documentaion and patents.

Since the New Zealander is now in the process of attempting to publish his
theory in a reputable British magazine, I am not at liberty to divulge his
address prematurely.  Interest in New Zealand and Australia is running
high, and possible breakthroughs in energy technology should not come
totally unexpected in these two countries with strong intellectual tiers to
England.

CONCLUSION:  There is now overwhelming evidence for the actual existence of
a very high density, energy rich space continuum formerly called ""ether"".
This space energy can be concentrated, gathered, focused, magnified and
compacted by magnets of magnetic materials, which appear as the new core
material for converters of all kinds, utilizing the cosmic energy for new
technology applications.

Crystals are energy-sensing and channeling devices; they can serve as
transducers, as for instance in the Moray-Device, or the ""rock electricity""
of T.T. Brown.

Combinations of crystals and magnetic material appear to be the mainstay
for the development of ""hyper-space"" - converters and generators of power -
 utilizing free, cosmic energy in our future.

Unbiased, totally honest and impartial reexamination and reevaluation of
ALL scientific theorems and dogmas, as well as unhampered opportunities for
the pioneers of the new technology on the American and European continent
appear to be the prerequisite of success.

Those who accept that anything of the nature of ideas or ideology is
permanent, use all their strength to hold on to it, and condemn all who do
not agree.  The next stage of this spiritual illness of the mind is to
build a monument to what they perceive is Truth, and then to build a
monument to their own permanence in the world.  This, they do by seeking
fame or fortune, and authority over others.  This is the contemporary,
planetary psychology situation, and thus are we losing the gift of
perspective and horizon and are no longer able to discern what is
important.  Skeptics are on record as saying:

     ""We are not running out of natural resources or intellectual
     talent, we are running out of the freedom of innovation that made
     the countries on the North American continent the most advanced
     nations on Earth"".

The future will show whether this freedom, which includes the freedom and
the duty of taking risks, can be restored to the degree our founding
fathers have been striving for.  Only then will we know whether the late
Wernher von Braun was not too overly optimistic when he stated:

     ""The cosmic age will bring a dawn of knowledge not yet envisioned.
     IT WILL DWARF ALL OUR PRESENT KNOWLEDGE AND IDEAS and, through its
     vastness, may even bring men closer together on their own planet"".

raza1@gmail.com,art10.txt,"ne has a
stead enough hand to produce satisfactory results.
     With patience, it is possible to reverse a cassette
recording. Transfer the music from the original record or tape
onto a blank tape cassette. Place the cassette flat on a table.
Draw our the part of the tape with the suspected message and snip
it off at both ends. Hold the tape segment horizontally. Rotate it
180 degrees, keep it horizontal at all times. This turns the tape
end for end. Splice the reversed tape segment back onto the two
loose ends of the cassette with strong adhesive tape. Reel the
tape back inside the cassette. The sliced segment will play
backward on an ordinary cassette player.
     I rented a recording studio to test the secret-message
rumors. New copiies of the records in question were transcribed on
a quarter-inch master tape. Where rumor alleged that a single
stereo track contained a message, right and left stereo tracks
were transcribed separately. Records with alleged inaudible
messages were treated similarly. To test claims of reversed
messages, recordings on the master tape were edited out and
spliced in backward. Twenty cuts or portions of cuts from sixteen
albums were tested.


""Another One Bites the Dust""
Queen, THE GAME

Rumor: When played backward, the lyrics say, ""It's fun to smoke
marijuana.""
Findings: There is something that sounds like ""It's fun to smoke
marijuana"" in the reversed music. It is repeated over and over. It
might be rendered no less faithfully, however, as ""sfun to scout
mare wanna."" This ""message"" is the reversal of the song title,
which is repeated as a line in the song.
     Let's make a distinction between engineered and phonetic
reversals. When an artist records a verbal statement, reverses it
by turning the tape end for end, mixes the reversed statement onto
a master tape, and has records and tapes produced from the master,
that is an engineered reversal. When the phonetic properties of
song lyrics are such that they can be reversed to sound like
something else, that is a phonetic reversal.
     ""It's fun to smoke marijuna"" is clearly a phonetic reversal.
The lyrics are perfectly plain played forward (""Another one bites
the dust""), no so plain played backward (""sfun to scout mare
wanna""). With an engineered reversal, the opposite should hold
true: gibberish forward, clear as a bell backward. Some are
prepared to believe that phonetic reversals are just as
intentional as engineered reversals -- that the songwriter
painstakinginly planned the phonetic double-entendre. In the
absence of confirming evidence, that just doesn't wash. It's too
easy to find coincidences. If, for example, the letters of the
alphabet are recited in conventional fashion (Ay, Bee, Cee, etc.)
and reversed, at least five sound like English language words. D
reverses to ""eden,"" F becomes ""pray,"" S becomes ""say,"" V becomes
""even,"" and Z becomes ""easy."" ""It's fun to smoke marijuana"" is
likewise a coincidence.


""A Child is Coming""
Jefferson Starship, BLOWS AGAINST THE EMPIRE

Rumor: When played backward, ""son of Satan.""
Findings: Another phonetic coincidence. The repeated ""It's getting
better"" reverses to an iffy ""son of Satan,"" the ""of"" drawn out and
the ""Satan"" strongly accented on the first syllable.


""Eldorado""
Electric Light Orchestra, ELDORADO

Rumor: When played backward, ""He is the nasty one/ Christ, you're
infernal/ It is said we're dead men/ Everyone who has the mark
will live.""
Findings: Coincidence. The supposed message lurks around the line
""On a voyage of no return to see."" Reversed, this passage becomes
the expected syllable salad -- no one hearing it would describe it
as anything but reversed music. Only if you listen while reading
along with what you're supposed to hear will you get anything. The
rumored version of the message is somewhat fudged. The passage
sounds more like ""He's to nasty one/ Christ you are, Christ,
you're fernal/ There wiss uh, we're dead men..."" There is no ""in""
in what is taken to be ""infernal."" The line that is supposed to be
""Everyone who has the mark will live"" isn't even close, though the
syllable count is right.


""Shoo Be Doo""
The Cars, CANDY-O

Rumor: When played backward, the word ""Satan"" repeated
approximately eleven times.
Findings: Coincidence. The rumor refers to the reversal of the ""Shoo
be doo, shoo be doo, shoo be doo..."" near the end of the song. Given
the mysterious logic of reversed phonemes, these three-syllable units
can be hard as a repeated two-syllable word. The word sounds a little
like ""Satan.""


""Snowblind""
Styx, PARADISE THEATER

Rumor: According to a mimeographed list of suspect records distributed
by Congressman Dornan, the words ""Satan move through our voices"" when
played backwards.
Findings: Negative. Despite repeated listenings, it was not even
possible to identify the part of the reversed track that Dornan et al.
are talking about.


""Stairway to Heaven""
Led Zeppelin, untitled, a.k.a. STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN

Rumor: In reverse, ""I live for Satan... The Lord turns me off...
There's no escaping it... Here's to my sweet Satan... There's power in
Satan... He will give you 666.""
Findings: Coincidence. If you listen very carefully to the ""And it
makes me wonder"" lines in reverse, you'll hear something approaching
""There's no escaping it."" A better description is ""There's no escape
do."" Knock of the last syllable, and you have ""There's no escape,"" a
complete, intelligible sentence in reverse. It's there, all right, but
it's not an unlikely enough coincidence to -- well, make you wonder.
      The ""Satan"" in ""I live for Satan"" is good and clear. The ""I live
for"" part isn't. The other alleged lines are unremarkable. All are
phonetic reversals of the entirely lucid forward lyrics and obviously
just accidents.


""When Electricity Came to Arkansas""
Black Oak Arkansas, BLACK OAK ARKANSAS and RONCH AND ROLL

Rumor: In reverse, ""Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan. He is God. He
is God.""
Findings: The BLACK OAK ARKANSAS cut was reversed. Again, pairs of
reversed syllables are being freely interpreted as ""Satan."" ""He is
God"" was not identifiable.


""Rain""
The Beatles, HEY JUDE

Rumor: Unintelligible lyrics at the end are reversed.
Findings: A true engineered reversal and not really a secret. ""Rain""
seems to have been the first popular recording to incorporate an
obviously reversed lyric. The story is that John Lennon accidentally
spliced the last part of the song in backward and liked the effect.
When reversed, the strange-sounding vocals at the end become
intelligible as a reprise starting with the drawn-out word
""sunshine.""
      The reversal is less apparent to the casual listener than it
might be because the accompanying music is not reversed. The ending
fits in smoothly with the rest of the song, the vocals suggesting a
foreign language.


""Fire on High""
Electric Light Orchestra, FACE THE MUSIC

Rumor: When played backward, ""The music is reversible, but time --
turn back!""
Findings: ""Fire on High"" is instrumental. About twenty-six seconds
into the music, scrambled speech is heard. It is mostly louder than
the accompanying music and begins with a two-syllable unit repeated
several times. The seeming speech lasts for about fourteen seconds.
      Reversing the music confirms that there is a true, engineered
message. In reverse, a voice (Jeff Lynne's?) says, ""The music is
reversible, but time -- turn back! Turn back! Turn back! Turn back!""
All the words are clear and unambiguous. Anyone comparing this to the
alleged reversal on ELO's ""Eldorado"" will have no trouble telling
which is genuine.


""Goodbye Blue Sky""
Pink Floyd, THE WALL

Rumor: In reverse, ""You have discovered the secret message.""
Findings: The ""secret message"" is at the very end of the instrumental
passage following the ""Goodbye Blue Sky"" vocals. It comes just before
the words ""What shall we do"" at the start of the song that is
identified as ""Empty Spaces"" on the record label and as ""What shall we
do now?"" on the record sleeve. Played forward, the message is less
apparent than the FACE THE MUSIC reversal: A reasonably attentive
listener might play THE WALL through and not catch it. It suggests
speech not quite close enough to be overheard. In context this is not
unusual because the ""Goodbye Blue Sky"" instrumental passage includes
""airport noises"" and other sound effects. A loud climax in the music
further masks the unintelligible voice.
      When played backward, the voice (Roger Waters?) plainly intones,
""Congratulations, you have just discovered the secret message. Please
send your answer to old Pink, care of the funny farm..."" As the voice
fades out, there may be another word -- perhaps ""Chalfonte or
""Chelsea"" -- after ""funny farm.""


""Heavy Metal Poisoning""
Styx, KILROY WAS HERE

Rumor: A red sticker on the KILROY WAS HERE cover warns, ""By order of
the Majority for Musical Morality, this album contains secret backward
messages...""
Findings: This is a case of second-generation backward-masking. Styx'
PARADISE THEATER did not contain a backward message, though a lot of
people said it did. So Styx has included a sure enough backward
message on KILROY WAS HERE. It is at the very beginning of ""Heavy
Metal Poisoning."" The reversed speech last about three seconds. There
is no musical background. The words reverse to ""Annuit coeptis. Novus
ordo seclorum."" This is the Latin motto encircling the pyramid on the
back of a dollar bill. The usual translation: ""God has favored our
undertakings. A new order of the ages.""
      The cover sticker's ""Majority for Musical Morality"" is a
fictitious Falwellesque group in the KILROY WAS HERE video. Although
the sticker suggests a plurality of ""messages,"" only one was found.


Space between ""I'm So Tired"" and ""Blackbird""
The Beatles, untitled, a.k.a. THE WHITE ALBUM

Rumor: A reversed message. At the time of the Paul-is-dead stories,
the segue from ""I'm So Tired"" to ""Blackbird"" was offered as evidence.
It was held to contain John Lennon's voice, reveresed, saying ""Paul is
dead, miss him, miss him, miss him."" That interpretation seems
unlikely now, but there is a mysterious low muttering between the
songs.
Findings: The mumbling is actually just to the ""I'm So Tired"" side of
the shiny ""space"" between cuts on the record. Each of the stereo
tracks was recorded separately, twice, and a copy of each track was
reversed. This produced four versions of the two-second passage: right
forward, left forward, right reversed, and left reversed. All were
equally unintelligible. It was not even apparent whether the voice is
forward or reversed. Nor could John Lennon be identified as the
speaker. There are nine or ten syllables. The first six (when played
forward) are a two-syllable unit repeated three times. There is little
or no difference betwen the stereo tracks. Any claimed interpretation
of the sounds seems doubtful.


""Strawberry Fields Forever""
The Beatles, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR

Rumor: It was, of course, claimed that John Lennon says ""I buried
Paul"" at the end. (It's forward, at the very end after the music
fades to complete silence, returns, and starts to fade out again.)
But Lennon told ROLLING STONE that the words are ""cranberry
sauce.""
Findings: They are ""cranberry sauce."" The ""sauce""/""Paul"" part is
indistinct, but the first syllable sounds a lot more like ""cran""
than ""I.""


""Baby You're a Rich Man""
The Beatles, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR

Rumor: On one of the tracks the line ""Baby you're a rich man too""
is sung as ""Baby you're a rich fag Jew,"" a dig at Brian Epstein.
Or some think it's ""rich fat Jew"" and claim it as evidence of
Beatle anti-Semitism.
Findings: Negative. The two stereo tracks are nearly identical.
It's always possible to hear words as similar-sounding words, but
basically, the lyrics jibe with the published version.


""Revolution 9""
The Beatles, untitled, a.k.a. THE WHITE ALBUM

Rumor: Various reversed and/or one-track speech. The reversal of
""Number nine"" to ""Turn me on, dead man"" has pretty much been
discounted as coincidence (though it appears on Congressman
Dornan's list).
Findings: Distinction between lyrics and any hidden message blurs
on ""Revolution 9."" The eight-minute cut is a montage of sounds
collected by John Lennon and Yoko Ono. It includes discordant
music, radio broadcasts, sirens, applause, gunfights, sports
cheers, the crackling of a fire, screams, a baby gurgling, a choir
singing, and much that cannot be identified. For this
investigation, ""Revolution 9"" was transcribed four times, twice on
each stereo channel. One copy of each of the tracks was reversed.
The four resulting versions were compared with each other and
against the original two-channel version.
     ""Revolution 9"" contains a lot of talking. Played in stereo,
forward, the longest stretch of understandable speech is probably
an announcer saying, ""...every one of them knew that as time went
by they'd get a little bit older and a little bit slower...""
     One believable instance of reversed speech occurs: someone
saying ""Let me out! Let me out!"" (once held to represent McCartney
in his totaled Aston-Martin). Two iffy reversals occur on the
backward recording of the right stereo track:""She used to be
assistant"" and ""There were two men..."" Neither is clear enough or
long enough to be convincing. Some of the music, including the
recurring theme, sounds more natural in reverse.
     ""Turn me on, dead man"" is a typical phonetic reversal. The
forward ""number nine"" (repeated throughout the cut) is clear; the
reversal is slurred -- something like ""turn me on dedmun."" It has
been claimed that ""number nine"" must be pronounced with a British
accent or with some careful inflection in order to reverse to
""Turn me on, dead man."" This seems not to be so. As an experiment,
three American-accent renderings of ""number nine"" were reversed.
All sound about as much like ""Turn me on, dead man"" as the record
did. Like the other phonetic reversals, ""Turn me on, dead man""
must be considered a coincidence.
     Much of ""Revolution 9"" is on one stereo track only. Near the
end a voice says ""A fine natural imbalance...the Watusi...the
twist...Eldorado...Eldorado."" ""A fine natural imbalance"" is on the
right track only, though the words that follow are in stereo. One
of the longer bits of speech -- ""Who could tell what he was
saying? His voice was low and his [unintelligible] was high and
his eyes were low"" -- is clear on the left track, a bare whisper
on the right.
     There is a stereophonically concealed ""secret message"" on
""Revolution 9."" The words are on the right track. They begin about
four minutes, fifty-eight seconds into the cut and run for about
twenty-two seconds. They are not likely to be noticed in stereo
because of the much louder left track. The sound of applause
begins on the left track at about five minutes, one second into
the cut. Deafening noises -- the clapping, sirens, music --
continue on the left track until five minutes, forty seconds. It
may or may not have been Lennon's and Ono's intention to conceal
the spoken passage. Given the haphazard quality of ""Revolution 9,""
the concealment may have been accidental. To recover the passage,
the left track must be switched off. The right track can then be
heard to contain a sound like a stopwatch ticking, behind these
words:

     So the wife called, and we better go to see a
     surgeon....[A SCREAM MUFFLES A LINE THAT SOUNDS LIKE
     Well, what with the prices, the prices have snowballed,
     no wonder it's closed.] ...So any and all, we went to
     see the dentist instead, who gave him a pair of teeth,
     which wasn't any good at all. So instead of that he
     joined the bloody navy and went to sea.
                      by William Poundstone
                              1986

     There really are backward messages on rock albums. And the
controversy over ""backward masking"" and ""porn rock"" has inspired a
whole new spate of messages. There may have been more genuine
backward messages in the past few years than ever before.
     The backward message controversy is usually traced to the
1960s and John Lennon's avant-garde sound mixing on such tracks as
""Revolution 9"" on the Beatles' WHITE ALBUM. Lennon probably wasn't
trying to conceal a message so much as create an interesting
sound.
     The matter might have ended right there had it not been for
the Paul McCartney death rumor. College kids tried playing Beatles
records forward, backward, and at various speeds to find ""clues""
to McCartney's fate. In the process they found snippets of speech
from Lennon's experiments. Even after McCartney was found safe and
sound in Scotland, some listeners continued to look for hidden
messages.
     Somehow, fundamentalist Christian groups became convinced
(ca. 1982) that the alleged messages were commercials for devil
worship. Not a single indisputable satanic message has turned up,
but there were scattered attempts to ban or label certain albums.
In 1986 one fundamentalist group announced that the theme song for
the old MR. ED TV show contains the word ""Satan"" when played
backward.)
     Ironically, the publicity accorded nonexistent messages has
inspired several artists -- among them porn rock hearing witness
Frank Zappa -- to hide real background messages in their music.
It's easy to do.
     The performer speaks or sings the message normally, then
reverses the tape, which is mixed into the soundtrack. This is all
accomplished simply enough at any recording studio.
     What's not so simple is playing it back. More home record,
cassette, and compact disk players won't play backward. You can
turn a record backward with a pencil eraser, but it's not good for
the needle or the turntable. The only way to reproduce the message
with full fidelity is to use a professional-quality reel-to-reel
tape player and splice the tape in backward.
     We used the facilities of KLOS radio in Los Angeles to
reverse some recent records containing true backward messages.


""Secret Messages""
Electric Light Orchestra, SECRET MESSAGES

ELO's ELDORADO album was among those alleged to contain satanic
backward masked messages. A patient listening to ELDORADO played
backward reveals no such messages. You hear only what you ought to
hear -- the reversed lyrics of the songs, which sound nothing like
the ""messages"" claimed to be there. In the wake of such
allegations, ELO did put an (innocuous) backward message on their
FACE THE MUSIC album. Perhaps they thought this would show how
silly the allegations were. Instead, the backward-masking people
seized on this as proof that the other ""messages"" were real. In
the latest volley, ELO has named an album after the controversy.
     In Britain (where the backward-masking issue is viewed as an
American eccentricity), the cover of SECRET MESSAGES has a mock
warning label to youth about the hidden label. Word of the albums'
impending release in the United States caused enough of a furor to
chill CBS Records into deleting the cover blurb.
     The reversed message is easy to find. It's at the beginning
of the first song, which is itself called ""Secret Messages."" You
can hear reversed speech when you play the record normally. A
voice intones ""secret messages"" -- forward -- in the middle of the
reversed speech, lest anyone dare be so unhip as to not know
what's going on.
     We transferred a new copy of SECRET MESSAGES to reel-to-reel
tapes and played it backward. The backward message goes: ""WELCOME
TO THE BIG SHOW/ WELCOME TO THE BIG SHOW.""
     That's it.


""Ya Hozna""
Frank Zappa, THEM OR US

""Ya Hozna,"" a six-minute composition on the first record of the
THEM OR US double album, is ENTIRELY backward. The albums' inner
cover, which includes lyrics for the other songs, says, ""backwards
vocal -- you figure it out"" of this cut. It credits Frank and Moon
Zappa, George Duke, and Napoleon Murphy Brock as vocalists.
     Played forward, ""Ya Howza"" sounds like a record played
backward -- reasonably so. The vocals are prominent and
unintelligible. Moon Zappa's voice is curiously recognizable, even
in reverse. It is hard to tell whether the music was recorded
forward or backward.
     When ""Ya Howza"" is played in reverse, you discover that the
music is virtually a palindrome -- it sounds about the same
forward and backward. The voices are all backward. In some cases
they have been modified electronically. Many of the words are
muffled. Even after repeated careful listening on both stereo
tracks, it is difficult to make out many of the lyrics. It doesn't
help that some of the words seem to be stream-of-consciousness
nonsense. Some of the unintelligible stuff sounds like opera.
     Starting at the beginning of the reversed tape -- the end of
the forward tape -- the clearer vocals go like this: ""I am the
heaven, I am the water."" This is in a hymnlike register. ""You are
a lonely little girl./ But your mommy and your daddy hold you."" A
singsong synthesizer voice.
     The most interesting part of the lyrics is an intermittently
orgasmic rap in Moon Zappa's Valley Girl voice. There are three
short monologues:

I'm like green!
I'm like squat!
I'm like soul!
Repeat, like soul!
I'm like pull, push,
Okay, like slow, slow.

You're never too old
Like slow, like slow, like slow
Okay, I like it.


All right, faster, faster,
Go, do it, do it twice,
Yeah, that feels good,
I'm looking great,
Yeah, fer shure!
Like, no way!


""No Anchovies, Please""
J. Geils Band, LOVE STINKS

""No Anchovies, Please"" is a novelty song, really a narration with
sound effects, about a woman who is kidnapped after eating
anchovies. She is taken to a ""foreign-speaking"" country. The sound
effect of the foreign tongue seems reversed. When you do play it
in reverse, it becomes: ""It doesn't take a genius to know the
difference between chicken shit and chicken salad.""


""Darling Nikki""
Prince, PURPLE RAIN

""Darling Nikki,"" cited as porn rock before Congress, is about a
dominatrix in a hotel lobby masturbating with a magazine. In part,
the complaint was that the album cover (flowers, and Prince on a
motorcycle) wasn't explicit enough to warn kids of the suggestive
lyrics. Senator Paula Hawkins apparently was not aware of a
backward message hidden in ""Darling Nikki."" The last thirty-five
seconds of the song is gibberish. The music changes abruptly and
becomes a repeated glottal sound. Then a two-syllable sound is
repeated twice, something like ""heaven, heaven."" Unintelligible
speech follows. At the end is a sound reminiscent of rain or bacon
frying , and wind sounds.
     Played backward, the message becomes:

     Hello, how are you?
     I'm fine 'cause I know that the Lord is coming soon.
     Coming, coming soon.

     It is clearly Prince and the Revolution singing this. The
words are clear but the intonation is funny -- the linger on some
words. Perhaps this is to make the reversed message you hear
playing the record normally a little less conspicuous.
     This is a weird reversal of the supposed secret message
menace. Raunchy forward lyrics conceal a religious secret message.


""Judas Kiss""
Petra, MORE POWER TO YOU

Petra is an obscure group that sings religious songs to a rock
beat. As further proof that things have gone full circle, the
backward-masking controversy prompted Petra to include a wholesome
backward message on their MORE POWER TO YOU album. It is in the
transition between two songs, just before ""Judas Kiss."" Clearly
audible gibberish reverses to this (the husky voice a cross
between George Beverly Shea and Dee Snider): ""What are you looking
for the Devil for, when you ought to be looking for the Lord?""

AFL JoyceM Welcome to the Apple II Music & Sound chat - our discussion will
           be on NoiseTracker - the new FTA music program for the GS.  AFA
           Gene will be our host this evening...Gene, the floor is yours :)

AFA Gene   Hi all... well first I'd like to point out, if y'all aren't aware
           yet, that a spanking new version of NoiseTracker has recently
           been released (9 days ago) and is now available in our New Files
           library. It is version 0.5. I haven't played around with it much
           yet, but it's supposed to fix a lot of the little bugs in 0.3
           (the first version we had online).  NoiseTracker also includes
           the ability to directly import ""modules,"" a term used for a
           certain type of Amiga song file which has become popular among PC
           users using the SoundBlaster sound card.

           Now, via NT, these ""MOD"" files are accessible by the GS. We
           expect to see a lot of activity on this end as far as ports from
           the PC and Amiga go. Note that you should be able to go straight
           to the PC music forum and download any recently uploaded MOD
           songfiles (there was a bug in the first wide release of the PCAO
           software, however, so a bunch of files with dates between around
           March 1991 and September 1991 may not download properly. Note that
           to use these PC MOD files, you'll have to rename the downloaded
           file ""MOD.xxxxxx"" if you want it to show up automatically in NT's
           ""open"" dialog box. (On the PC, all MOD files are named
           ""xxxxxxxx.MOD"" instead.)   Also, if the files are packed with ZIP
           compression, you'll need a program from the Communications Forum
           called AGATE -- it's a terminal program that includes the ability
           to unpack ZIP files.

           Now, I guess the best thing to do would be to talk about our
           favorite songfiles... there have been a few complaints, in fact,
           that people were not being ""descriptive"" enough in their file
           descriptions for uploads in describing the songs.

AFC Eddie  ?

AFA Gene   GA ed

AFC Eddie  Once a MOD file is unpacked with Agate, is a file type change
           needed?

AFA Gene   Nope, since all that NT looks for is the ""MOD."" being the first
           four characters in the filename.

AFC Eddie  OK, Thanks!

Deanna7332 Question...

JonL7      Can you list some of the features of Noisetracker?

AFA Gene   (you don't even need that ""MOD."" if you want to type the name in
           directly.)

Deanna7332 Did any of these mod files have anything to do with FTA's ""Module
           A""

AFA Gene   Sure Jon, right after we answer Deanna's question. Deanna, you
           mean ""Modulae?""

Deanna7332 Yes, that's it.

AFA Gene   Modulae was a demo written by FTA last year. (i'll get to you in a
           sec Doors).  It used SoundSmith v0.95 for all it's music. There
           is no connection between MOD files and Modulae by FTA.

Deanna7332 Throughout the demo it said ""Loading modules""

AFA Gene   Those ""modules"" are not the same as Amiga soundfile ""modules"" --
           you see, what Modulae really was was a ""stringing together"" of a
           bunch of neat little tiny demos that FTA had written. So they
           called each little demo a ""module"" and thus the entire demo as a
           whole, ""Modulae"" (fancy plural of module?)

Deanna7332 Ok I understand.  Thank you. :)

AFL JoyceM Latin, Gene :)

AFA Gene   The term ""MODule"" from the Amiga comes from the idea that all the
           stuff needed to play the songfile (all the instruments + the
           sequence file) are included into one file, the ""module.""

TheDoors1  Gene, I have tried to d/l some recent uploaded MODs in the PC
           music area and still the problem exists.

AFA Gene   As I understand it, the problem was fixed VERY recently (correct
           me on this Joyce) and files uploaded as recently as early
           November still might not work depending on the version of the
           PCAO software that the uploader used.

AFL JoyceM Actually, Gene...I was under the impression that it had been, but
           if Doors is still having a problem, then it must not be fixed.

AFA Gene   What date was the file you tried to d/l, Door?

TheDoors1  umm 11/17, around there

AFA Gene   hmmm.... well i can tell you one thing... if it didn't work, don't
           waste your time again later... the problem is in the Apple
           software's method of d/lling files, and there are no plans to
           upgrade the Apple AO software.

AFL JoyceM I will endeavor to get an answer to that PC downloading
           problem/question :)

ThomasK63  i have a quick question... what can you use to unpack amiga mod
           files? On the PC side, that is.

TheDoors1  Agate Thomas

ELECTMUSIC Doors... what happens on after downloading..

Deanna7332 If it's LZHed you can't unless you have an IBM or
           PC/Transporter.

AFA Gene   If GS-ShrinkIt doesn't have that ability, i don't think there
           exists any such utility on the GS.

TheDoors1  What do you mean Elect?

ELECTMUSIC After you download the file... where do you encounter a problem?

TheDoors1  ok, you know when you download the file and at some point in the
           download the file starts to appear on your screen.  That's when I
           cancel it.

ThomasK63  I am sure soething good can be made w/out resorting to Amiga
           files

AFC Eddie  Yes, Doors, I believe the problem is with the PC software it was
           UL'd with.

TheDoors1  yeah Eddie.

GNO Tim    Amiga MOD files are typically compressed using LHarc.  I've
           uncompressed several on my Unix machine at school.

ThomasK63  good time for someone to make a lharc unpacker...

AFC DYAJim someone might be ;)

GNO Tim    Several people are already

AFC Eddie  Can't wait, Jim!

AFA Gene   Jon, did you have a question?

JonL7      The features of Noisetracker :)

AFA Gene   Oh yes... okay, here goes, in a nutshell, from most important to
           least:


AFA Gene   *  ability to import MOD files

           *  ability to import Soundsmith files

           *  ProDOS 8 based

           *  virtually no editing abilities (not a feature but important to
           know)

AFC DYAJim :)

AFA Gene   *  forgot: and the most important feature of all, the ability to
           hold instrument files in regular system RAM instead of DOC RAM,
           allowing for instruments far beyond the regular 64K limit found
           in ALL other GS music programs.

ThomasK63  I'll buy that!

TheDoors1  I have another question...when you're ready.

AFA Gene   GA Doors

TheDoors1  ok..is it true that NoiseTracker will take in soundsmith files and
           play them more clearly

AFA Gene   Well, as far as ""what you hear,"" yes there is a definite
           difference with some instruments. It does NOT play the sounds
           more ""clearly,"" but it just plays them in a different way. What
           many people seem to like about this ""different way"" is that
           sustained instruments (i.e. instruments designed to be played
           in a loop to simulate a long held note) seem to work better (or
           perhaps simply the way they were originally intended to work).

TheDoors1  I see

Deanna7332 Which takes up more space - MOD or NT  w/soundfile ?

AFA Gene   Deanna, it depends a few things, such as how big the sequence is,
           how many instruments you have, etc. Once you have a lot of
           assorted files, it'll probably average out to be about the same
           give or take a hundred blocks on your HD. So it basically depends
           on whether you prefer to have your instruments separate or not.

Deanna7332 Does playing quality differ with either one ?

AFA Gene   Nope. It's exactly the same either way. Loading time is the same
           too.

AFC Eddie  Can NT save songs as MOD files?

AFA Gene   Nope. It has options for Open and Close module, but these are
           still inactive.

AFA Gene   If there are no more questions, I'd like to talk about which NT
           files out there are the ""hottest,"" since this info could be
           useful to many users who are interested in downloading NT/MOD
           files.

           My personal favorite is ""Lambada,"" which is supplied by FTA with
           the program but is available separately on America
           Online.Everything about this file is really impressive except
           perhaps the sound quality of the horn-ish melody instrument.

           What about y'all, what are your favorite NT files?

AFL JoyceM Gene, there is a classical song for NT, but can't remember the
           name, but it is good.

AFC Eddie  I like Dragnet!

ELECTMUSIC So do I Ed

TheDoors1  I like Seven something

Deanna7332 My most favorite of all mod files is Pleasure Principle

AFC Eddie  <--appreciate's Greg's taste!

AFL JoyceM :)

AFA Gene   Deanna, i assume you got that from a local board?

Deanna7332 I got it from the PC forum here.

TheDoors1  I saw it there also

Deanna7332 I think under ""Pleasure""

AFA Gene   Would you be able to upload it here? If it's really that good, we
           ought to have it available directly in our oun NT lib here (BTW
           folks, we will be releasing a new NoiseTracker software library
           soon!)

AFC Eddie  What a Forum!!!

Deanna7332 That sounds great!

AFL JoyceM Gene, do you think it will be possible for synthLAB files to be
           converted to MOD files?

AFL JoyceM MOD files?

AFA Gene   I doubt it, Joyce. The formats are so diametrically opposed in
           their entire basis of their file formats that it wouldn't be
           worth the time for a programmer to develop such a convertor.

Deanna7332 Isn't it possible to move the mod file from the PC forum to our
           music library?

AFA Gene   But..... it might be worth the time for a MIDI File Format to MOD
           convertor, since these two formats are more widely accepted.

Nuzz       they have nothing better to do Gene

ELECTMUSIC Gene.. some interesting similarities with DTune and NTracker

AFA Gene   They lose the file, tho, Deanna. :)

AFL JoyceM In what way, Greg?

ELECTMUSIC Both Prodos 8

Deanna7332 Shhh they won't know a thing :)

ELECTMUSIC I also believe Bill uses a shuttling of sound data between Doc
           Ram and Ram.

AFC Eddie  Interesting, Greg.

ELECTMUSIC Thats how he gets some of the excellent instrument quality

AFC Eddie  But Diversitune has that one distinction:  MIDI input.

AFL JoyceM Deanna, we would greatly appreciate it if you would upload that
           'Pleasure' song to our library :)

ELECTMUSIC Agreed Ed.. one of the factors FTA doesn't like to incorporate
           into their programs.

Deanna7332 I'll u/l it tonight if possible.

AFL JoyceM Thanks :)

AFC Eddie  Thanks, Deanna!

AFL JoyceM I will send Bill B a copy of NoiseTracker + some MOD files...to
           see what comments we get from him (will send when I get back).

AFC DYAJim What ever happened to that diversitune upgrade that was talked
           about ?

ELECTMUSIC That would be interesting Joyce

AFC Eddie  Bill apparently still working on it, Jim.

ELECTMUSIC I am sure he would appreciate the Prodos 8

AFC DYAJim good..

AFL JoyceM Jim...RSN....he was hoping by Christmas (this year), but he is
           soooo busy with his job, who knows?

AFC DYAJim Oh yeah, I noticed the speed calcuation in NT .5 is inaccurate
           :)

AFC DYAJim I recall he has set a lot of Christmas projected dates :)

ELECTMUSIC He was one of the first ""Free Tools"" experts in breaking all the
           rules for economic sake.

AFC DYAJim like for the vaporware DT inst editor like 2 years ago.

Deanna7332 Are there any Christmas Mod or NT songs?

AFC Eddie  Oh yeah, Diversi-Editor!

AFL JoyceM I know, Jim - but that I know he has been working on.

AFC DYAJim he projected Christmas for it, and it never came :)

AFA Gene   Not yet in AMS, but hopefully the Holiday Contest will change all
           that. :)

AFC DYAJim I look foreward to any upgrades..

AFL JoyceM Not that I am aware of Deanna - you have some?  hint, hint

Deanna7332 Nope sorry.  I was hoping there were some that could be u/led
           here

AFC DYAJim I'll be breaking out the xmas tune book rsn.. I should be able to
           midi a few :) (which rules out nt)

AFL JoyceM Question...

AFC Eddie  It would be more appropriate to have a converter from Appleworks
           spreadsheet to MOD than from MIDI!

AFL JoyceM If I got ahold of an Amiga song (MOD) disk...how would I convert
           them for here?

AFA Gene   You mean an Amiga-formatted disk?

AFL JoyceM Yes

AFC DYAJim Ack.. methinks you need an amiga and a null modem cable or a
           modem.

AFA Gene   Methinks Jim is right

AFC DYAJim LOL!!  Design your music in the spreadsheet then import to NT :)
           IT might actually have better editing?!! :)

AFC Eddie  Right!

AFL JoyceM Me thinks he is right.  If I had them upload to me, would that
           work?

AFA Gene   Yep; should work like a charm.

AFC DYAJim Yah.. as long as they're coming from an amiga

AFL JoyceM Great....I will work on that when I get back  (making note now).

AFL JoyceM Gene, will you get some of those files (NT) sent to that area
           tonight?  If so, I will leave the needed message :)

AFA Gene   That's all I have planned for tonight's chat, Joyce. Yep, I'll
           move some files right now.

AFL JoyceM Thanks...

AFL JoyceM Then we should have our NoiseTracker Library by end of the week in
           AMS :)

ELECTMUSIC Gene... quick question:  Are you launching NTracker from a 3.5
           disk?

AFL JoyceM Okay, guys...I will see you all the week of December 11th (may the
           4th) as I am off on vacation.

AFA Gene   Yep greg

AFC JohnC  Where are you going?

ELECTMUSIC Do you encounter out of memory problems

AFL JoyceM Night all...and Gene, thanks for an excellent chat and great
           explanations of NoiseTracker.

Nuzz       Joyce, I have good news for FutureSound owners. SoundConvert will
           support it in the first release

AFC Eddie  Great, Mike!

AFA Gene   Greg, i always keep my RAMdisk at 0 when using noisetracker. Not
           only are

AFC JohnC  Mike...SoundConvert...released?

AFL JoyceM Great, Mike.  When can we get SoundConvert, Mike? and FutureSound
           :)

AFA Gene   there a couple of bugs with memory management, but if you're
           loading in a MOD file that's really big, NT will eat your RAMdisk.

AFC Eddie  Sounds good.

Nuzz       The manual is being ""layout"". Release date should be about 1st
           week of Dec

ELECTMUSIC Tnxs Gene

AFC JohnC  YES.......WTG Nuzz!!!!!!!!

Deanna7332 Yes, why is there on some MOD files a stop somewhere in the middle
           ?

Deanna7332 That's really frustrating!

AFL JoyceM Mike, leave me E-Mail on when and how I can send your the $$ to
           get it.

AFL JoyceM Again...night all

Nuzz       gee John, I had to do something to explain the delay :)

ELECTMUSIC Thanks Gene for a GREAT chat!

AFC Eddie  Yes, Gene!  Great!

AFA Gene   Thanks Greg, 'night!

AFA Gene   thanx, see y'all later :)

Copyright 1987 Bob Szekely.

    John Michael Osbourne, (known as ""Ozzy"" to his fans), has in his long 
career as vocalist for Black Sabbath had his work with the group misconstrued 
as advocating Satanism.  In a 1983 radio special featuring Ozzy, the 
interviewer expressed precisely this point; ""...Ozzy has always been shrouded 
in the darkest of Satanic imagery.  Yet if you really listen to his music, 
you'll find that what he is saying differs greatly from his image....""(1)  Even 
the group's image has often been described as ""occult and diabolic"".(2)

    The important point to remember here is to differentiate between appearance 
and reality.  Although the name ""Black Sabbath"" conjures up images of witches 
and sorcerers paying homage to Satan for the powers bestowed upon them, this 
does not make it safe to assume that the group that went by this name 
necessarily drew the inspiration from the occult.(3)  The closest they ever 
came to it was a gothic horror film featuring Boris Karloff as narrator; they 
adopted their name directly from the name of this film.(4)  Black Sabbath was 
involved in the black arts as much as Karloff practiced casting spells off-
screen.  Tony Iommi, the group's guitarist, summed it up best when he described 
the group as having basically ""...the same appeal as a horror movie.  It's all 
an act.""(5)










    Just as their film counterpart did, Ozzy and Sabbath found the occult 
mythos to be an effective vehicle for powerful social commentary; particularly 
when put in the context of heavy-metal rock and roll.  Ozzy himself noted that 
there are ""...people who pick up my [album] cover[s] and go...'This guy's got 
to be singing about Devil, doom, death and destruction.'  Which is not the 
case....""(6)

    The late Lester Bangs likened the group to Bob Dylan and William Burroughs, 
describing them all as ""...moralists...trying to deal with a serious present 
situation in an honest way....""(7)  Ozzy and Black Sabbath merely bring to 
light the many evils of our world in their work, to try and make us realize 
that we are all victim to their influence.  They hope to make us recognize 
these evils so that we may take up arms against them; a point Ozzy emphatically 
stresses:  ""...one thing everybody has got to understand about Black Sabbath's 
lyrics.  They're not downer lyrics, they're just telling everybody where it's 
at...""(8)  He also cites the group's most controversial tune, ""Black Sabbath"", 
as a response to the ignorant hippie culture still force when the tune was 
written in 1970:  ""The hippies said: 'The world is beautiful man.' (sic)  You 
only had to look around you to see how crappy it was.  It was ridiculous 
listening to that stuff, let alone playing it, so we just wrote about the world 
the way it really was and how it affected us - and we felt better in ourselves 
because we were really being honest....""(9)

    I   1   HAVE YOU EVER THOUGH ABOUT YOUR SOUL-
        2   CAN IT BE SAVED?
        3   OR PERHAPS YOU THINK THAT WHEN YOU ARE DEAD
        4   YOU JUST STAY IN YOUR GRAVE.
        5   IS GOD JUST A THOUGHT WITHIN YOUR HEAD OR IS
        6   HE A PART OF YOU?
        7   IS CHRIST JUST A NAME THAT YOU READ IN A BOOK
        8   WHEN YOU WERE AT SCHOOL?

    II  9   WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT DEATH DO YOU LOSE
        10  YOUR BREATH OR DO YOU KEEP YOUR COOL?
        11  WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE THE POPE ON THE END
        12  OF A ROPE - DO YOU THINK HE'S A FOOL?
        13  WELL I'VE SEEN THE TRUTH - YES I'VE SEEN 
        14  THE LIGHT AND I'VE CHANGED MY WAYS.
        15  AND I'LL BE PREPARED WHEN YOU'RE LONELY 
        16  AND SCARED AT THE END OF OUR DAYS.

    III 17  COULD IT BE YOU'RE AFRAID OF WHAT YOU'R
        18  FRIENDS MIGHT SAY 
        19  IF THEY NEW YOU BELIEVED IN GOD ABOVE
        20  THEY SHOULD REALISE BEFORE THE CRITICISE
        21  THAT GOD IS THE ONLY WAY TO LOVE.

    IV  23  IS YOUR MIND SO SMALL THAT YOU HAVE TO FALL
        24 IN WITH THE PACK WHEREVER THEY RUN
        25  WILL YOU STILL SNEER WHEN DEATH IS NEAR
        26  AND SAY THEY MAY AS WELL WORSHIP THE SUN.

    V   27  I THINK IT WAS TRUE IT WAS PEOPLE LIKE YOU
        28  THAT CRUCIFIED CHRIST
        29  I THINK IT IS SAD THE OPINION YOU HADE WAS THE
        30  ONLY ONE VOICED.
        31  WILL YOU BE SO SURE WHEN YOUR DAY IS NEAR
        32  SAY YOU DON'T BELIEVE?
        33  YOU HAD THE CHANCE BUT YOU TURNED IT DOWN
        34  NOW YOU CAN'T RETRIEVE.










    VI  35  PERHAPS YOU'LL THINK BEFORE YOU SAY THAT
        36  GOD IS DEAD AND GONE
        37  OPEN YOUR EYES, JUST REALIZE THAT HE IS THE
        38  ONE.
        39  THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN SAVE YOU KNOW FROM
        40  ALL THIS SIN AND HATE.
        41  OR WILL YOU STILL JEER AT ALL YOU HEAR?
        42  YES!-I THINK IT'S TOO LATE.

    In this piece, the group asserts a belief in an afterlife and spiritual 
redemption.  As grisly as the image of a hanged pontiff is, its shock value is 
a necessary part of the message:  They reject religious dogma, stating that a 
belief in God, in one's own heart, is the only guiding light to help one inn 
his life (lines 11/12, 39/40).  Furthermore, the reject religious hypocrisy 
(lines 5/6, 7/8) and peer pressure (verses III, IV) as excuses for not 
accepting God.  To clarify further:  following the crowd does not justify 
shrugging responsibility for one's own actions.

    After re-reading, it becomes obvious that this song is an ascerbic critique 
of atheism; (line 35/36) I refer here again to verses three and four.  In these 
two verses, the picture painted in one of Godless conformity and how it's 
viewed as being as foolish as Paganism.  These lyrics set an example for the 
listener by relating personal experience (lines 13-16).  However, for those who 
cannot accept this the group has no recourse but to condemn them, although 
rather ironically; they hope that their rhetorical loss of faith in the 
listener will open his eyes (line 42).










                           B L A C K   S A B B A T H 



            WHAT IS THIS, THAT STANDS BEFORE ME?
            FIGURE IN BLACK, WHICH POINTS AT ME
            TURN ROUND QUICK AND START TO RUN
            FIND OUT I'M THE CHOSEN ONE.  OH, NO!
            
            BIG BLACK SHAPE WITH EYES OF FIRE
            TELLING PEOPLE THEIR DESIRE
            SATAN'S SITTING THERE, HE'S SMILING
            WATCHES THOSE FLAMES GET HIGHER AND HIGHER
            OH, NO, NO, -- PLEASE GOD HELP ME!
            
                IS THIS THE END MY FRIEND?
                SATAN'S COMING 'ROUND THE BEND
                PEOPLE RUNNING 'CAUSE THEY'RE SCARED
                THE PEOPLE BETTER GO AND BEWARE
                NO, NO!  PLEASE--NO!!
                
                
    The all time controversy winner!  Is this not irrefutably  THE song about 
Black Magic in rock?  It's all so obvious, suffuse with evil imagery; Satan, 
walls of flame, figure in black, and damnation at the end.  Yes, I see the 
images too; it definitely concerns Black Magic.  Then again, Shakespeare's 
Macbeth employed scenes of witches involved in conjurations; does that mean 
that Shakespeare was a warlock?  Poe used to write sardonic tragedies about 
twisted murderers and the bizarre nature of acts, did that make him an evil, 
leering, demented killer?  Did either of them advocated what they wrote about?  
One has to remember that writing about something is not necessarily the same as 
emulating it.  Tony Iommi spoke out quite strongly about this:  ""People are 
bringing us down saying that we are a Black Magic group.  I think they must be










getting mixed up with Black Widow.  We don't do any sacrifices on stage, and 
we're not on a black magic kick.  We wanted to do heavy numbers and the guitar 
riffs we worked out were more suited to evil things than love.  We play songs 
about black magic, but they are more likely to be against than for it.""(12)  

    By now, you're probably asking yourself who Black Widow is, right?  Then 
it's time for a little history:

        Sabbath, before they were known as Sabbath, had the same line-up but 
two earlier names.  The first one was Polka Tulk, which seemed sure to doom 
them to obscurity.(13)  The soon realized this and changed the group's name to 
Earth.  Now, Earth was a blues band at the end of the English blues boom.  As 
if that wasn't bad enough, they soon discovered that not only was there another 
group named Earth, but they had also released a single.  To avoid confusion, 
they changed their name again.(14)  But what made them decide on that name?  
Just ask Ozzy:  ""I just liked the name Black Sabbath because of the succession 
of vowel sounds.(15)  If that sounds ludicrous just consider this:  Sabbath was 
""...the first of the really committed, loud and heavy bands...""(16)  They 
needed a name to match the gut-wrenching power they were developing.  Tony knew 
that he wanted Sabbath to be noticed above all the rest of the British blues 
bands:  ""We wanted something of our own that we'd like and people would like.  
And we wanted something loud!""










    Tony didn't hate the blues.  He'd cut his teeth as a guitarist on the likes 
of The Shadows, Buddy Holly and Django Rheinhardt, developing his own style 
from there.  But he realized the group had no future in the blues:

        'We couldn't keep playing 12-bars forever.  We just got fed up with 
Earth music.  It was jazz, blues stuff.  It was good for practice but nothing 
else.'

    In the late 'Sixties, blues groups were a dime a dozen in Birmingham and 
interest was waning in the blues boom due to the glut of groups.  One man, by 
the name of Jim Simpson, had heard Earth around the Birmingham club circuit and 
understood what they were trying to do.  He decided to take them under his 
wing.  With the aid of his massive record collection, Jim expanded the group's 
horizons in the areas of jazz and blues.  He introduced them to artists like 
Wes Montgomery, Count Basie and Jimmy Rushing.  It was from Rushing in 
particular that they derived the repetitive riff style so readily noticeable in 
their later incarnation as Black Sabbath.

    The Count Basie influence is evidenced in the song ""Wicked World"" from the 
first album; Sabbath drummer Bill Ward uses a ""'sighing hi-hat'...in the manner 
of Basie's drummer Jo Jones.""










    The influence is subtle, almost subliminal.  Yet it is one which was not 
thought capable of hard, 'heavy' rock bands in the late 'Sixties.  Although Led 
Zeppelin and Jimi Hendrix also had their work steeped in blues and jazz 
derivations (Hendrix' ""Third Stone From the Sun"" and Zeppelin's version of 
Willie Dixon's ""I Can't Quit You Baby"" from their first album), neither was 
able to match the intense energy of Black Sabbath.  Iommi has always had a 
preference for music with an original, distinct style of its' own; as an 
example, he mentions guitarists Joe Pass and Alvin Lee as two of his strongest 
songwriting influences.

    It would also be necessary that Sabbath develop a unique, distinctive style 
and image of their own.  Though they had changed their name from Earth to Black 
Sabbath to avoid confusion with the other Earth; at the same time another group 
emerged by the name of Black Widow ""...who WERE profoundly influenced by the 
occult, had a male witch as a patron, and wrote pieces like ""Come to The 
Sabbat.""  Unfortunately, Sabbath was constantly reaping the benefits of Widow's 
publicity.

    Sabbath was a group that never minced words.  If they saw something as 
destructive, they would be sure to rub the listener's face it it.  They did not 
want their point to be missed.

    With their straightforward, sometimes brutal way of looking at things, they 
try to shock the listener's conscience back into awareness.  The imagery of 
""Hand of Doom"", from the Paranoid album, is candid and condemning; it is a 
strong statement against drug addiction and rightly so...

            IT'S TO LATE TOO TURN
            YOU DON'T WANNA LEARN
            PRICE OF LIFE YOU CRY

    Many people felt the group's overall direction was pessimistic and had a 
negative effect on its listener's due to that.  ""Ozzy insisted that if people 
thought he was having a bad effect on the minds of young kids, they should go 
and watch the TV news where real murder and mayhem were a way of life, and 
shown night after night."" (18)

    Sabbath was never negative in their message; they were simply truthful 
about waht they saw as wrong in the world.  If you ""Strip away the horror 
stories, the imagery and the hysteria, (and) turn down the amps a notch...you 
have a well-rehearsed, solid blues and rock band, powered by a dedication to 
well defined objectives.""  On the top of the list of those objectives was 
truth; Sabbath never feared facing that truth squarely, regardless of what many 
people thought of them.

Long, long, time ago,
I can still remember,
When the local calls were ""free"".
And I knew if I paid my bill,
And never wished them any ill,
That the phone company would let me be...

But Uncle Sam said he knew better,
Split 'em up, for all and ever!
We'll foster competition:
It's good capital-ism!

I can't remember if I cried,
When my phone bill first tripled in size.
But something touched me deep inside,
The day... Bell System... died.

And we were singing...

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

Is your office Step by Step,
Or have you gotten some Crossbar yet?
Everybody used to ask...
Oh, is TSPS coming soon?
IDDD will be a boon!
And, I hope to get a Touch-Tone phone, real soon...

The color phones are really neat,
And direct dialing can't be beat!
My area code is ""low"":
The prestige way to go!

Oh, they just raised phone booths to a dime!
Well, I suppose it's about time.
I remember how the payphones chimed,
The day... Bell System... died.

And we were singing...

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

Back then we were all at one rate,
Phone installs didn't cause debate,
About who'd put which wire where...
Installers came right out to you,
No ""phone stores"" with their ballyhoo,
And 411 was free, seemed very fair!

But FCC wanted it seems,
To let others skim long-distance creams,
No matter 'bout the locals,
They're mostly all just yokels!

And so one day it came to pass,
That the great Bell System did collapse,
In rubble now, we all do mass,
The day... Bell System... died.

So bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

I drove on out to Murray Hill,
To see Bell Labs, some time to kill,
But the sign there said the Labs were gone.
I went back to my old CO,
Where I'd had my phone lines, years ago,
But it was empty, dark, and ever so forlorn...

No relays pulsed,
No data crooned,
No MF tones did play their tunes,
There wasn't a word spoken,
All carrier paths were broken...

And so that's how it all occurred,
Microwave horns just nests for birds,
Everything became so absurd,
The day... Bell System... died.

So bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

We were singing:

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?

I hear Valkyries a-comin                There are people into Voodoo
In the air their song is comin          there are people into Voodoo
They forgot the words! They're hummin!  I know I do, I hope you do!
But they're good enough for me!         and it's good enough for me!

We will venerate Bubastis             We will read from the Kabahlah

We will all bow down to Enlil       There are some who practice Shinto
We will all bow down to Enlil       there are some who practice Shinto

With bold Gilgamesh the Brave!      but that's good enough for me!

We will all see Aphrodite               We will all sing Hare Krishna
Though she's pretty wild and flighty    We will all sing Hare Krishna
She will meet us in her nightie         It's not mentioned in the Mishna
And she's good enough for me!           But it's good enough for me!

It was good enough for Loki         We will all go to Nirvana

He thinks Thor's a little hokey     Make a left turn at Urbana

Here's to those who copy Conan    There will be a lot of lovin
Here's to those who copy Conan    when we're meetin in our Coven
They're just Followers of Onan    Quit yer pushin and yer shovin
and that's good enough for me!    So there's room enough for me!

We will have a mighty Party           It was good enough for Sappho
In the honor of Astarte               With her lady on her lap-o
Grab your chiton - don't be tardy     She put Lesbos on the map-o
'Cause she's good enough for me!      With her pagan poetry!

Shall we sing a verse for Venus,    Well the Christians all are humming
Of the Gods she is the meanest,     Cause they say their God is coming,
Cause she bit me on my...elbow      Our God came three times this evening
And it's good enough for me.        And that's good enough for me.

We will worship like the Druids,      Some guys have a circumcision
Drinking strange fermented fluids,    On account of their religion,
Running naked through the woo-ids,    An embarrassing incision
Coz that's good enough for me.        Cut just ENOUGH from me!   

We will sing a verse for Loki       It was good for old Jehovah
He's the old Norse god of Chaos     He had a son who was a nova!
Which is why this verse don't       Hey there, Mithras! Move on ova'!
       rhyme or scan or nothin'     Another resurrection Day!
But it's good enough for me...

It was good for Thor and Odin       It could be that you're a Parsi

There are those who, when they've got e-
Normous problems that are knotty
They just take them to Hecate         Thanks to great Quetzacoatl
And that's good enough for me!        And his sacred axolotl
                                      And his gift of chocolatl

And we sing in harmony!            But that's good enough for me!

Hare Krishna gets a laugh on         I'll arise at early mornin'

Well, that's good enough for me!     To know that's right for me!

Lilith wears a lacy nightie        That Bob Larson shrieks and hollers

She's wet-dream enough for me!     And that's good enough for me.

There are those who scream and hollar  There are those who worship Satan

Some folks pray to the Great Spirit   There is room enough in Hades

To the tune of Handel's ""Largo""      Praise to Popacatapetl

And that's good enough for me.       So he's good enough for me.

We will drive up to Valhalla         We will all bow to Hephaestus
Riding Beetles, not Impalas          As a blacksmith he will test us
Singing ""Deutschland Uber Alles""     'Cause his balls are pure asbestos
And that's good enough for me.       So he's good enough for me.

We will sing of Iluvatur,             We will sing of Foul the Render,
Who sent the Valar 'cross the water   Who's got Drool Rockworm on a bender
To lead Morgoth to the slaughter      In his cave in Kiril Threndor--
And that's just fine with me.         They're both too much for me.

                                             (Atenveldt Verses)

   Now here's a story, a little bit gory,
   A little bit happy, a little bit sad.
   About a drink called Imperium Compound
   And how the SCA's been had!                       

   Chorus: Oh we think, we think, we think,
           The King is a fink, a fink, a fink,
           A figure of respectability
           Rules the Kingdom thru Imperium Compound
           The results are plain to see!

   Mongol Hordemen, those free-living swordsmen
   Subverting the Kingdoms from underneath!
   Have no use for Imperium Compound
   Except perhaps to brush their teeth!

   AltChorus: Oh we fink, we fink, we fink,
              The Khan and the Kink, the Kink, the Kink,
              And the Board, their Great Senilities!
              The Western Irgun, drinks Imperium Compound
              And we're BACK, with results you'll see!    

   Lady Laurel, with Authority Royal,
   Passes and rejects our heraldry
   She needs a swig of Imperium Compound
   Then perhaps she'd deign to talk to me!            

   Lady Trude thought it her duty
   To turn a social wrong into a Right
   Proved her point with Imperium Compound
   And showed that Cheshire Cats can fight!  //and scratch//

   The Board of Directors styled themselves The Electors
   And another con they tried to swing
   Now the BoD drinks Imperium Compound
   So we no longer need a King!                        

   AltChorus: Oh the Bod, the BoD, the BoD,
              It thinks it is God, is God, is God,
              The figure of Supreme Authority!
              And if we O.D.'d on Imperium Compund
              there'd be no need for Royalty!          

   Oh, MEDIEVAL Net, we thought it was all wet
   With witty remarks, and other kinds of sass
   We'll feed our computers on Imperium Compound
   And BYTE the BoD right on its' righteous ass!         

   Good old Duncan was often drunken
   Chasing all the ladies fair
   He bathed himself in Imperium Compound
   Now he has a little savoir faire!

  ATEN IMPERIUM (cont.)

   Ioseph of Locksley, never changes his socks, he
   Runs around looking like a Cavalier,
   He stocked up on Imperium Compound
   And he has enough to last for years and years!        

   AltChorus: Oh they forgot, forgot, forgot
              The Locks-e-ly Plot, the Plot, the Plot!
              And it works the best when it is underground!
              It isn't a hassle for a green-and-white tassle
              They're the ones that BREW Imperium Compound!  

   Trelon of the Wood, he was very good, he
   Was a leader that had never been beat before;
   But Caid had Imperium Compound,
   And Imperial Roman Caid won the War!  //with help!//   

   In Tyr Ysgithr, it's regularly whispered there
   That the Kingdom is ruled over by a King    // What's THAT? //
   They're ""democratic"" and quite erratic....
   They've forgot the purpose of the whole damn thing!     

   King Sir Mark von, with his pretty white suit on,
   Rules the Kingdom both with Grace and Purity!
   He never touches Imperium Compound
   At least not where anyone else can see!               

   Duke Sir Deaton, was never beaten
   On the field, or in the drinking hall;
   At the Catbox War with Caid,
   Left thirty bodies piled against the wall!             

   Denis O'Titans was good at smitin'
   A Locksley Monster in every single way!
   Drank a little Imperium Compound
   And ATE Deaton's sword that day  // No! REALLY! //       

   Wotan the Mongoloid, a little bit paranoid,
   But a nice guy none the less;
   Drank a mess of Imperium Compound
   Now he's Justin du Roc, I confess!                       

   Then there's Duke Reynard, with a face like a St. Bernard
   Of the Dukes, he is the homliest
   He tends to toke up on Imperium Compound
   And go out and whomp on anybody's best!                   

   This song'll bedevil the folks at a revel,
   And most of the time it will annoy the King,
   So take a drink of Imperium Compound
   And let's go Royalty-bedeviling!                        

   Duchess Anna is quite a fan-a
   Going on a wartime shopping spree!  \\ War Point!\\
   Took a drink of Imperium Compound
   And shopped so fast we couldn't see! \\ Z-o-o-o-om!\\    (5)

  ATEN IMPERIUM (Cont.)

   Lyn of Whitewolfe, made of the right stuff,
   Twice the Queen of Atenveldt;
   Took a drink of Imperium Compound
   And the Kingdom of Caid before her knelt!              

   Duke Sir Brion, and Duke Sir Trelon,
   Won the Crown with regularity;
   Drank a lot of Imperium Compound,
   And founded a dynasty!                                 

   Stephan von Geist, was most awful nice,
   And a chivalrous fighter without any doubt
   Took a swig of Imperium Compound
   And won the Crown his first time out!                    

   All the Crusadenes were big, but not mean,
   And the finest fighters in the town.
   But they all drank Jerusalem Compound,
   Winning Crown after Crown after Crown!                 

   Good Duke Arthur couldn't get no farth-er
   A Norman King in Aten Land
   Drank too much of Imperium Compound
   And went off to conquer Engel-land!                    

   Then King Richard, a bit of a bitch, heard
   A King's Crown could be done.
   Drank a little Imperium Compound
   And became the Aten King, first one!                    

   Duchess Malinda, who doesn't do windas,
   But she does a lot of Duchess Things,
   But give her a LOT of Imperium Compound,
   And she sings and sings and sings and sings and sings!   

   Duke Sir Brion, with his pretty white suit on,
   Is a model of goodness and purity
   Never touches Imperium Compound
(spoken:) And I'll sell ya seashore property in Yuma, too!  

   Optional last verse:

   Many tales abound of Imperium Compound
   And its' strange effects on Royalty,
   But after an hour, this song has no power,
   And by now, it's boring ME!                            

   AltChorus: Oh it's too long, too long, too long
              To sing the whole song, the song, the song
              Longer than a Royal Court, it is!
              But sing it serial, this ditty Imperial
              And you'll be a bardic whiz!

                          WTP-0002C

        Last night I had the strangest dream in this bleak century
        I dreamed that people the world around believed in Chivalry

        I dreamed I saw a Kingly Crown enshrined in laurel leaves
        with Grace and Joy and Purity attendant at his feet

        I dreamed I saw the perfect Knight receive his accolade
        and minstrels sang and children laughed in some soft forest glade

        I dreamed I saw the finest thing that ever man could make
        grow great and strong and undefiled: Pray God I never wake!

        Last night I had the strangest dream in this bleak century
        I dreamed that people the world around believed in Chivalry

               (to the tune of ""Good King Wenceslaus"")

                Locksley Monsters never yield
                on the field of battle
                strike the helm and bash the shield
                make their eyeteeth rattle
                Bodies on the ground will lie
                bones will burst in sunder
                search for Locksleys' enemies:
                You'll find them six feet under!

                              SONG OF IVANOF

            There is a man who we know well that does the best he can
            but he's displayed in armour made of reticulated garbage cans!

            He looks so fine and fair and strong, oh how he plays the man
            and how it's prized, those galvanized, reticulated garbage cans

            The noblest Roman of them all, a good Praetorian
            a combatant who wears no pants, judst reticulated garbage cans!

            Like old Horatius at the Bridge, like the Legions of Valerian
            (O dearie me: those LOVELY knees!)
            and those reticulated garbage cans!

         (sung to the tune (obviously) of the 12 Days of Christmas)


1.           The first time I sent my device, The Heralds said to me

            ""It violates the Rule of Three""

2.           The next time I tried it, the Heralds said to me

            ""We changed the forms, and it violates the Rule of
             Three"".

3.           The third time I tried, and the Heralds said to me, 

            ""We upped the fees, we changed the forms, and it
             violates the Rule of Three"".

4.           Another time I tried and the Heralds said to me,
 
            ""We haven't got it, we upped the fees, we changed the 
             forms, and it violates the Rule of Three"".

5.           The fifth time I tried it, the Heralds said to me,  

            ""In a decision rendered by the College of Arms on
             August 1st, A.S. V it was decided that this style of
             heraldic design was not appropriate to the aims and 
             intentions of the Corporate Body. Holy! Holy! Holy! ""

 note: verse 5 is delivered in an extremely fast, mono-
       tone, similiar to a Gregorian Chant.

           "" ....we haven't got it, we upped the fees, we changed the forms,
             and it violates the Rule of Three.""

6.           I tried it a sixth time, and the Heralds said to me,

            ""We changed the rules, &c""

7.           A seventh time I tried and, the Heralds said to me,

            ""It's against the Rule of Tincture, we changed the
             rules, &c""

8.           I tried it once again and the heralds said to me,

            ""It's not a Period design, It's against the Rule of Tincture, We
             changed the rules, &c""

                                * more *



    Heralds Said To Me (cont.)

9.           I sent it in once more, and the Heralds said to me,

            ""We changed the rules again, It's not a Period design,
             it's against the Rule of Tincture, we changed the
             rules, &c""

10. (sung in cold anger)
             The LAST time I sent my device, the Heralds said to me

    (sung in a state of SMUG)
             ""Someone else has got it, &c""




              (nb: every single one of these reasons has been used by the
              CoA, at one point or another, to reject perfectly good
              heraldry, along with some even MORE stupid.  If the shoe 
              fits....................!!!!!!!!)

           or: Who was that Vermin I saw you with last, Knight?
   or: There may be Lice on all you Knice, but there ain't no Lice on me

           Once there was a Barony howling in the wilderness
           nestled in the Valley where the River doesn't flow
           and the folks were driven buggy by the insects in the Revel Hall
           Authenticity is wonderful, but this doesn't go!

                   Bugs on the Baroness, bugs on the Baroness!
                   That was the cry that you heard all the day
                   and the scratching can be heard from Ysgithr to Ered Sul
                   why did we come here? Let's go away!

           See them all a scratching, nestled in their armour tight
           the fleas have a melee team that's challenging the field!
           call Truly Nolen! Someone's gotta help us out!
           the crabs are nesting in our helms but we'll never yield!

                   (chorus)

           Dawn comes a-breaking, the bugs have won the Coronet...
           flea-infested Conan-clones in piles upon the lawn
           where is the Barony? The bugs have eaten everyone...
           termites got the stick-jocks, and all their sticks are gone!

                  For all the Lands where I have dwelt
                  Oh Atenveldt, Oh Atenveldt
                  till rivers burn and mountains melt
                  lest I forget my Atenveldt
                  From deserts stark to snow-capped peaks
                  from silent lakes and laughing creeks
                  sing: Oh let man find his heart's ease
                  on rocky plains
                  in desert breeze

                  For oft I thought of mighty men
                  who carved a Land with sword and pen
                  and lit a candle, burning bright,
                  that pierced the darkness; stirred the night!
                  tho some are gone their deeds remain
                  this sunny Crown without a stain
                  sing: Oh, their deeds were not in vain!
                  in sunlit days
                  and falling rain.....

                  So raise your banners, blazoned bright
                  Advance the Dream and Shine the Light!
                  in battle's crash and Revel's song
                  raise high the Flag and wave it long!
                  For all the Lands wherein I've dwelt
                  I love you best, my Atenveldt!
                  Sing: Oh the Joy that I have felt!

      What the use of wearing panties
      whalebone corsets of your Auntie's
      boxer shorts and other scanties
      best of all is nude
      there's such fun in going bra-less
      now that it's no longer lawless
      'specially if your figure's flawless
      best of all is nude
      nude is what you're born in
      shirts are never torn in
      underwear and lacy flimsies, garter belts and other whimsies
      yards of itchy cloth to put your form in
      ducks all do it, maidens rue it
      even ancient Picts in Britain blue it
      going naked's how to do it
      best of all is nude!

      If your garters aren't elastic
      tie them up in knots fantastic
      (panty hose is something drastic!)
      best of all is nude!
      If you're tired of wearing clotheses
      shed your garment 'mongst the roses
      never mind the old bluenoses
      best of all is nude!
      Nude is best for ducking!
      Worst for horses bucking!
      Moonlit nights will see such sights
          that are very best for fooling round
                              .....and elbows!
      Nudity is grand to see
       a well-known antidote to virginity
      take your clothes off and you'll see:
      best of all is nude!

                   Hi said the Lady dressed in white
                   sang the Day and sang the Night
                   sang the Land and sang the Sea
                   sang the Song, and then sang Me!

                   (extra verses) Salt and oil and mirror bright
                                  fire and fleet and candlelight
                                  by fin and feather, leaf and tree,
                                  fill the cup and blessed be!

                                  From the misty crystal sea
                                  came the Lady to the lea
                                  Sword and Roses in Her Hand
                                  spread their seeds thruout the Land

                                  Came the Stag from oaken wood
                                  saw the Lady where she stood
                                  by the fire burning bright
                                  came to know his heart's delight!

                   (end of extra verses)

                   By Sword and Harp, and Irish Hound
                   Blessed Be: the Day I've found
                   Hail to the Lady, one in Three
                   Present is Past and Past is WE

                   By Oak and Ash and Holy Thorn
                   bledded be the Day you're born!

               and kept our hands from Hellishe Crime
               and made us a Kingdom in their own good time

               Now, Atenveldt forgets the Past

                    WEAPONS AT THE DOOR

 Being a Polemic concerning the alleged Custom of the West Kingdom concerning 
 checking your Weapons at the Door of the Revel Hall. As the Satire is the 
 Weapon of the Bard, this said Polemic is to be checked at the Door, along with 
 swords, knives, redheaded Ladies and other such Deadly Things.....

         As I roved out to Western Lands to take the Western Air
         I went into a Revel Hall and I saw a Twelfth Night there
         but I was halted at the gate by a Privy Consellor
                 (that's the man who tells the King of the West how to go to
                  the bath room!)
         who told me I would have to check my Weapons at the door

         As I, in my astonishment, stood hung on tenter-pegs
         a Knight came in whose Prouess hung down between his legs
         the Doorman grabbed a greatsword and he struck the Knight full sore
         and gave him a reciept; he left his weapon at the door!

         a Bard was next whose goodly Voice has entertained us all
         but he, too, was prevented from entering the Hall
         and told he could not carry deadly weapons on the floor
         he left his Voice and Harp among the weapons at the door

         a Master entered graciously, a man we all know well
         who holds a 3rd Dan Black Belt, tho this he'd never tell
         the Master struggled valiantly, the Master cursed and swore
         but he left his hands, and feet, as weapons at the door

         the company was jovial, altho a bit dismayed
         for lack of proper cutlery, down to the smallest blade
         for even teeth and fingernails, each can be used in War
         were cut, and pulled, and left behind, as weapons at the door!

         And has their King not loyal Knights that He must be afraid
         of brawling in his Hall and of Assassin's bloody blade?
         the Rights of Men to carry Arms at least WE'VE not foreswore
         and a POX on them that made the Rule of Weapons at the Door!

                           THE STREETS OF ANN ARBOR

               As I walked out thru the streets of Ann Arbor
               as I walked out thru Ann Arbor one day
               I spied a young Mongol all dressed in white linen
               all dressed in white linen and cold as the clay

               I then spied another, done in on the sidewalk
               along with just about six dozen more
               their wounds were all gaping, from mace and from braoadsword
               from claymore and cannon, all dripping with gore

               what caused this grave carnage, I cried to the Monglos
               oh pray what's the reason for this awful sight
               my answer came slowly from under the corpse-pile
               ""It seems that our bark is much worse than our bite.....""

               the answer continued from pale lips a-shaking
               we sang all our songs and believed them as true
               the Dark Horde could never be beaten in battle
               we thought this was what all good Mongols could do...

               we went down to Atenveldt all for to plunder
               ""too large to defend"" was our song every night
               but Atenveldt's different from East, West or Middle
               there, even the bushes have learned how to bite!

               the Clann stole our ponies, the Scraelings our foodstuffs
               we ran into axes in AtenViking hands
               our maidens ran off with one Richard of Arkham
               and we're all that's left to return to our lands

               MacChluarains and Monsters, Lockehaven and Foxmoor
               that Kingdom is BIG and its' fighters are MEAN!
               we fought and we lost, and fled back to Ann Arbor
               we all came back home with results that you've seen

               keep away from that Land with its' cactus and marshes
               it's no place for Mongols who are bent on War
               they count their blows well, but they strick them yet better
               he crawled into his Yurt, and fell, dead, on the floor.....

                            C. A. Bethancourt III
       tune: the song of the Cowardly Lion, Tin Woodsman and Scarecrow
             in the movie version of the Wizard of Oz

        (Enter the Scarecrow, who singeth:)

        My wife is always nagging; my Prowess it is lagging
        I can't do anything
        she has got a reason, but revenge is out of season
        Oh I wish I could be King!

        If I just had the Crown on, I'd always have a frown on
        and the Barons on a string
        Heads they would be rolling, the Board would be cajoling
        Oh if only I was King!

        I am very fed up with the way this group is set up
        Oh I'd change everything!
        they are so high and mighty with the way that they do fight-ey
        Oh, someday I'll be King!

        Tho my wife is melancholic, and very...vitriolic
        she's a wasp without a sting!
        I'd have to supervise her with a pack of tranquilizers
        If I only was a King......

        (the Tin Woodsman joineth him, and singeth:)

        I grew up kind of cocky, and rather big, and stocky
        and straight as any rod
        on the field I'm a battallion, with the Ladies I'm a stallion
        ...Oh they'd better make me God!

        The other boys are jealous they say I'm over-zealous
        they'd do better to applaud
        the things that I am giving to this Dream that we are living
        oh I wish they'd make me God!

        They say that I'm conceited, but I'm just badly treated
        by people and by BoD
        just think of what they're missing by My Majesty dismissing
        Oh they'd better make me God!

        (the Cowardly Lion creepeth forth, and singeth:)

        Oh I could be a fighter, a great and mighty smiter
        and be the perfect knight
        it's a great and nasty shame, and everyone's to blame
        oh I wish that I could fight!

        Song of the Three (cont.)

        I could be a Cavalier drinking wine and ale and beer
        and be a gorgeous sight
        but it would cost me too much money so it isn't very funny
        oh I wish that I could fight!                               

        Let me at 'em on the field, I would surely make them yield
        to my Power and my Might
        with rattan, shinai and rapier they would nevermore escape here
        If they'd only let me fight

                She was afraid to come out to the Tourney
                She was worried that ""something might show..""
                She was afraid to come out to the Tourney
                And the poor thing did NOT want to go...

                  (2 - 3 - 4, tell the people what she wore!)

                  It was an itsy bitsy teeny weenie little rabbit fur bikini

                  An itsy bitsy teenie weenie little rabbit fur bikini
                  And in her apartment she wanted to stay!

                One day in the Kingdom of the Middle
                It happened at a Tourney one day:
                The Mongols invaded the Middle
                But the Middle did not want to play...

                  (eins - zwei - drei, but the Dark Horde wouldn't die!)

                  It was an itsy bitsy tiny teenie Nauseating Mongol weenie
                  That they saw, for the first time, that day.
                  An itsy bitsy tiny teenie Nauseating Mongol weenie
                  And the Mongols did NOT go away!

                Now the Heralds made up a new Rulebook
                And to read it is some kind of gas!
                It's a bureaucrat's dream, this new Rulebook
                Now NOBODY'S blazon can pass!

                  (Win - Place - Show, tell the Heralds where to go!)

                                 (insert Bronx cheer!)

                  I want an itsy bitsy teenie weenie little rabbit fur bikini
                  On my shield, as my blazon, today!
                  An itsy bitsy teenie weenie little rabbit fur bikini
                  But ""that's offensive"" the Heralds all say!

                I sat down at the Revel last evening
                To a feast of green meat, and Rat Pie...
                It was cold, and disgusting, and greasy
                And I just want to upchuck and die!

                  (6 - 7 - 8, tell them what was on your plate!)

                  It was an itsy bitsy teenie weenie little rabbit fur bikini
                  With a side dish of cold cabbage pie!
                  An itsy bitsy teenie weenie little rabbit fur bikini

          I'd rather sing a song than work (if it's not too phrasey!)
          Lengthy rhymes don't bother me....truth to tell: I'm lazy!

          Yang, your yurt is very nice, and your Horde is smelly,
          And I'm sure that yak-meat will nicely fill one's belly!
          But remember this one line, or you're not worth jelly:
          FIRST you plunder, THEN you burn! That's how to be rakehelly!

          My Lady Lorelei your eyes do drive me to distraction
          And the lovely Care-Cheri causes....petrifaction!
          But I, and they, quite taken are, so I can't take action...
          Therefore, Ladies, fill my cup; I'll drink to stupefaction!

          Now Atenveldt your fighters, all, are most good and gentle
          And the Ladies, bless 'em all, are most ornamental!
          But that little Nikki-Toad....has me sentimental
          Though with boffer in her hand she is argumental!

          This stupid little song, m'lords, is mostly sung in Latin
          By the Goliards, of course, from vespers clear to matins!
          But I prefer a coarser cloth over silk or satins
          English is more understood, mine enemies to flatten!

          Good People all, I've made my Song, its' music's well-recited
          But my voice could use some work; the flowers it has blighted!
          It's rude and rusty, grim and bad, and squeaky like a door-hinge,
          But I'm a better Bard than you: I found a rhyme for ""orange!""

 (note to verse 4: Nichelle of Whitewolfe is now a very beautiful young Lady
 resident in Caid. This verse was written when she was 2 years old. Ask HER!

                      by William Poundstone
                              1983

     Two mentalities are at work here: 1960s rock fans and 1980s
fundamentalist Christians. The idea of phonographically concealed
messages dates from the Paul McCartney death scare of 1969. For
hard-core types, the secret-message rumors never really died. Avid
rock fans have auditioned ever album release since the late 1960s
for hidden nuances. Backward messages, barely audible messages,
and messages on one stereo track only have been alleged. At the
other end of the sociosensual spectrum, fundamentalist Christians
have gotten into the act. TV programs such as PRAISE THE LORD and
THE 700 CLUB have propagated rumors of a satanic plot in the
recording industry, no less, in which various albums conceal
""backward-masked"" demonic murmurings. If THAT sounds too spacey to
be taken seriously, consider that it was the fundamentalist groups
who were behind House Resolution 6363, a bill introduced in the
U.S. House of Representatives by Robert K. Dornan (R., Calif.) in
1982 to label all suspect records: ""WARNING: THIS RECORD CONTAINS
BACKWARD MASKING THAT MAKES A VERBAL STATEMENT WHICH IS AUDIBLE
WHEN THIS RECORD IS PLAYED BACKWARD AND WHICH MAY BE PERCEPTIBLE
AT A SUBLIMINAL LEVEL WHEN THIS RECORD IS PLAYED FORWARD."" In
February 1983, the Arkansas State Senate passed a similar record-
labeling bill by a vote of 86 to 0.
     Contributing to the quasi-occult status of these rumors is
the difficulty of checking them out on home audio equipment. You
pretty much have to take someone else's word for it, or dismiss
the rumors out of hand.
     From a technical standpoint, there are four simple ways to
conceal a verbal message on a recording. The most obvious is to
record the message at a very low volume. The message may then be
recovered by turning the volume up while playing the record or
tape. If the message is faint enough, though, noise levels of home
equipment may garble it. If the accompanying music or lyrics are
loud enough, or if the message itself is indistinct or
electronically modified, it may be hard to hear on any equipment.
     A second gimmick is to record a message on one stereo track
only. Records and tapes have two independent recordings, of
course, normally played simultaneously for stereo effect. On a
record, each stereo track occupies on one side of the V-shaped
groove for the needle. On a tape, the tracks are recorded in
parallel lanes of the magnetic material. The two tracks are called
""right"" and ""left"" after the stereo speakers they will play on.
Otherwise, the tracks are interchangeable -- the sound mixer can
put anything he or she wants on each track. A message on one track
can be masked by simultaneous loud music or lyrics on the opposite
track. With normal stereo balance (or mono equipment) the loud
track drowns out the message track. At home, single-track messages
can be recovered by adjusting the stereo balance so that only the
desired track plays. Sometimes this trick also makes indistinct
words clearer. Even if the words are not exclusively on one track,
they may happen to be more audible on one track.
     A message could be recorded at a speed different from the
rest of the record. Then the record would have to be played faster
or slower than usual to recover the message. Unless the message
was at one of the standard speeds (say, 45 rpm on a 33 1/3 rpm
record), it could not be played normally on home equipment.
     The fourth and most commonly alleged trick is to record a
verbal message backward. Reversed speech has several unexpected
features. One is that syllables are not a constant in the reversal
process. A one-syllable word can have two or three syllables when
played backward. Thus ""number nine"" in the Beatles' REVOLUTION 9
reverses to ""Turn me on, dead man"" (or something like it), a jump
from three to five syllables.
     There is no simple way to predict what a word or phrase will
sound like reversed. Obviously, you can't just reverse the
letters.
     Reversed messages are difficult to recover at home. Record
turntables are not built to go backwards. Some have a neutral
setting, in which the pickup and amplifier remain active and you
can turn the record backward by hand. But hardly anyone has a
stead enough hand to produce satisfactory results.
     With patience, it is possible to reverse a cassette
recording. Transfer the music from the original record or tape
onto a blank tape cassette. Place the cassette flat on a table.
Draw our the part of the tape with the suspected message and snip
it off at both ends. Hold the tape segment horizontally. Rotate it
180 degrees, keep it horizontal at all times. This turns the tape
end for end. Splice the reversed tape segment back onto the two
loose ends of the cassette with strong adhesive tape. Reel the
tape back inside the cassette. The sliced segment will play
backward on an ordinary cassette player.
     I rented a recording studio to test the secret-message
rumors. New copiies of the records in question were transcribed on
a quarter-inch master tape. Where rumor alleged that a single
stereo track contained a message, right and left stereo tracks
were transcribed separately. Records with alleged inaudible
messages were treated similarly. To test claims of reversed
messages, recordings on the master tape were edited out and
spliced in backward. Twenty cuts or portions of cuts from sixteen
albums were tested.


""Another One Bites the Dust""
Queen, THE GAME

Rumor: When played backward, the lyrics say, ""It's fun to smoke
marijuana.""
Findings: There is something that sounds like ""It's fun to smoke
marijuana"" in the reversed music. It is repeated over and over. It
might be rendered no less faithfully, however, as ""sfun to scout
mare wanna."" This ""message"" is the reversal of the song title,
which is repeated as a line in the song.
     Let's make a distinction between engineered and phonetic
reversals. When an artist records a verbal statement, reverses it
by turning the tape end for end, mixes the reversed statement onto
a master tape, and has records and tapes produced from the master,
that is an engineered reversal. When the phonetic properties of
song lyrics are such that they can be reversed to sound like
something else, that is a phonetic reversal.
     ""It's fun to smoke marijuna"" is clearly a phonetic reversal.
The lyrics are perfectly plain played forward (""Another one bites
the dust""), no so plain played backward (""sfun to scout mare
wanna""). With an engineered reversal, the opposite should hold
true: gibberish forward, clear as a bell backward. Some are
prepared to believe that phonetic reversals are just as
intentional as engineered reversals -- that the songwriter
painstakinginly planned the phonetic double-entendre. In the
absence of confirming evidence, that just doesn't wash. It's too
easy to find coincidences. If, for example, the letters of the
alphabet are recited in conventional fashion (Ay, Bee, Cee, etc.)
and reversed, at least five sound like English language words. D
reverses to ""eden,"" F becomes ""pray,"" S becomes ""say,"" V becomes
""even,"" and Z becomes ""easy."" ""It's fun to smoke marijuana"" is
likewise a coincidence.


""A Child is Coming""
Jefferson Starship, BLOWS AGAINST THE EMPIRE

Rumor: When played backward, ""son of Satan.""
Findings: Another phonetic coincidence. The repeated ""It's getting
better"" reverses to an iffy ""son of Satan,"" the ""of"" drawn out and
the ""Satan"" strongly accented on the first syllable.


""Eldorado""
Electric Light Orchestra, ELDORADO

Rumor: When played backward, ""He is the nasty one/ Christ, you're
infernal/ It is said we're dead men/ Everyone who has the mark
will live.""
Findings: Coincidence. The supposed message lurks around the line
""On a voyage of no return to see."" Reversed, this passage becomes
the expected syllable salad -- no one hearing it would describe it
as anything but reversed music. Only if you listen while reading
along with what you're supposed to hear will you get anything. The
rumored version of the message is somewhat fudged. The passage
sounds more like ""He's to nasty one/ Christ you are, Christ,
you're fernal/ There wiss uh, we're dead men..."" There is no ""in""
in what is taken to be ""infernal."" The line that is supposed to be
""Everyone who has the mark will live"" isn't even close, though the
syllable count is right.


""Shoo Be Doo""
The Cars, CANDY-O

Rumor: When played backward, the word ""Satan"" repeated
approximately eleven times.
Findings: Coincidence. The rumor refers to the reversal of the ""Shoo
be doo, shoo be doo, shoo be doo..."" near the end of the song. Given
the mysterious logic of reversed phonemes, these three-syllable units
can be hard as a repeated two-syllable word. The word sounds a little
like ""Satan.""


""Snowblind""
Styx, PARADISE THEATER

Rumor: According to a mimeographed list of suspect records distributed
by Congressman Dornan, the words ""Satan move through our voices"" when
played backwards.
Findings: Negative. Despite repeated listenings, it was not even
possible to identify the part of the reversed track that Dornan et al.
are talking about.


""Stairway to Heaven""
Led Zeppelin, untitled, a.k.a. STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN

Rumor: In reverse, ""I live for Satan... The Lord turns me off...
There's no escaping it... Here's to my sweet Satan... There's power in
Satan... He will give you 666.""
Findings: Coincidence. If you listen very carefully to the ""And it
makes me wonder"" lines in reverse, you'll hear something approaching
""There's no escaping it."" A better description is ""There's no escape
do."" Knock of the last syllable, and you have ""There's no escape,"" a
complete, intelligible sentence in reverse. It's there, all right, but
it's not an unlikely enough coincidence to -- well, make you wonder.
      The ""Satan"" in ""I live for Satan"" is good and clear. The ""I live
for"" part isn't. The other alleged lines are unremarkable. All are
phonetic reversals of the entirely lucid forward lyrics and obviously
just accidents.


""When Electricity Came to Arkansas""
Black Oak Arkansas, BLACK OAK ARKANSAS and RONCH AND ROLL

Rumor: In reverse, ""Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan. He is God. He
is God.""
Findings: The BLACK OAK ARKANSAS cut was reversed. Again, pairs of
reversed syllables are being freely interpreted as ""Satan."" ""He is
God"" was not identifiable.


""Rain""
The Beatles, HEY JUDE

Rumor: Unintelligible lyrics at the end are reversed.
Findings: A true engineered reversal and not really a secret. ""Rain""
seems to have been the first popular recording to incorporate an
obviously reversed lyric. The story is that John Lennon accidentally
spliced the last part of the song in backward and liked the effect.
When reversed, the strange-sounding vocals at the end become
intelligible as a reprise starting with the drawn-out word
""sunshine.""
      The reversal is less apparent to the casual listener than it
might be because the accompanying music is not reversed. The ending
fits in smoothly with the rest of the song, the vocals suggesting a
foreign language.


""Fire on High""
Electric Light Orchestra, FACE THE MUSIC

Rumor: When played backward, ""The music is reversible, but time --
turn back!""
Findings: ""Fire on High"" is instrumental. About twenty-six seconds
into the music, scrambled speech is heard. It is mostly louder than
the accompanying music and begins with a two-syllable unit repeated
several times. The seeming speech lasts for about fourteen seconds.
      Reversing the music confirms that there is a true, engineered
message. In reverse, a voice (Jeff Lynne's?) says, ""The music is
reversible, but time -- turn back! Turn back! Turn back! Turn back!""
All the words are clear and unambiguous. Anyone comparing this to the
alleged reversal on ELO's ""Eldorado"" will have no trouble telling
which is genuine.


""Goodbye Blue Sky""
Pink Floyd, THE WALL

Rumor: In reverse, ""You have discovered the secret message.""
Findings: The ""secret message"" is at the very end of the instrumental
passage following the ""Goodbye Blue Sky"" vocals. It comes just before
the words ""What shall we do"" at the start of the song that is
identified as ""Empty Spaces"" on the record label and as ""What shall we
do now?"" on the record sleeve. Played forward, the message is less
apparent than the FACE THE MUSIC reversal: A reasonably attentive
listener might play THE WALL through and not catch it. It suggests
speech not quite close enough to be overheard. In context this is not
unusual because the ""Goodbye Blue Sky"" instrumental passage includes
""airport noises"" and other sound effects. A loud climax in the music
further masks the unintelligible voice.
      When played backward, the voice (Roger Waters?) plainly intones,
""Congratulations, you have just discovered the secret message. Please
send your answer to old Pink, care of the funny farm..."" As the voice
fades out, there may be another word -- perhaps ""Chalfonte or
""Chelsea"" -- after ""funny farm.""


""Heavy Metal Poisoning""
Styx, KILROY WAS HERE

Rumor: A red sticker on the KILROY WAS HERE cover warns, ""By order of
the Majority for Musical Morality, this album contains secret backward
messages...""
Findings: This is a case of second-generation backward-masking. Styx'
PARADISE THEATER did not contain a backward message, though a lot of
people said it did. So Styx has included a sure enough backward
message on KILROY WAS HERE. It is at the very beginning of ""Heavy
Metal Poisoning."" The reversed speech last about three seconds. There
is no musical background. The words reverse to ""Annuit coeptis. Novus
ordo seclorum."" This is the Latin motto encircling the pyramid on the
back of a dollar bill. The usual translation: ""God has favored our
undertakings. A new order of the ages.""
      The cover sticker's ""Majority for Musical Morality"" is a
fictitious Falwellesque group in the KILROY WAS HERE video. Although
the sticker suggests a plurality of ""messages,"" only one was found.


Space between ""I'm So Tired"" and ""Blackbird""
The Beatles, untitled, a.k.a. THE WHITE ALBUM

Rumor: A reversed message. At the time of the Paul-is-dead stories,
the segue from ""I'm So Tired"" to ""Blackbird"" was offered as evidence.
It was held to contain John Lennon's voice, reveresed, saying ""Paul is
dead, miss him, miss him, miss him."" That interpretation seems
unlikely now, but there is a mysterious low muttering between the
songs.
Findings: The mumbling is actually just to the ""I'm So Tired"" side of
the shiny ""space"" between cuts on the record. Each of the stereo
tracks was recorded separately, twice, and a copy of each track was
reversed. This produced four versions of the two-second passage: right
forward, left forward, right reversed, and left reversed. All were
equally unintelligible. It was not even apparent whether the voice is
forward or reversed. Nor could John Lennon be identified as the
speaker. There are nine or ten syllables. The first six (when played
forward) are a two-syllable unit repeated three times. There is little
or no difference betwen the stereo tracks. Any claimed interpretation
of the sounds seems doubtful.


""Strawberry Fields Forever""
The Beatles, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR

Rumor: It was, of course, claimed that John Lennon says ""I buried
Paul"" at the end. (It's forward, at the very end after the music
fades to complete silence, returns, and starts to fade out again.)
But Lennon told ROLLING STONE that the words are ""cranberry
sauce.""
Findings: They are ""cranberry sauce."" The ""sauce""/""Paul"" part is
indistinct, but the first syllable sounds a lot more like ""cran""
than ""I.""


""Baby You're a Rich Man""
The Beatles, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR

Rumor: On one of the tracks the line ""Baby you're a rich man too""
is sung as ""Baby you're a rich fag Jew,"" a dig at Brian Epstein.
Or some think it's ""rich fat Jew"" and claim it as evidence of
Beatle anti-Semitism.
Findings: Negative. The two stereo tracks are nearly identical.
It's always possible to hear words as similar-sounding words, but
basically, the lyrics jibe with the published version.


""Revolution 9""
The Beatles, untitled, a.k.a. THE WHITE ALBUM

Rumor: Various reversed and/or one-track speech. The reversal of
""Number nine"" to ""Turn me on, dead man"" has pretty much been
discounted as coincidence (though it appears on Congressman
Dornan's list).
Findings: Distinction between lyrics and any hidden message blurs
on ""Revolution 9."" The eight-minute cut is a montage of sounds
collected by John Lennon and Yoko Ono. It includes discordant
music, radio broadcasts, sirens, applause, gunfights, sports
cheers, the crackling of a fire, screams, a baby gurgling, a choir
singing, and much that cannot be identified. For this
investigation, ""Revolution 9"" was transcribed four times, twice on
each stereo channel. One copy of each of the tracks was reversed.
The four resulting versions were compared with each other and
against the original two-channel version.
     ""Revolution 9"" contains a lot of talking. Played in stereo,
forward, the longest stretch of understandable speech is probably
an announcer saying, ""...every one of them knew that as time went
by they'd get a little bit older and a little bit slower...""
     One believable instance of reversed speech occurs: someone
saying ""Let me out! Let me out!"" (once held to represent McCartney
in his totaled Aston-Martin). Two iffy reversals occur on the
backward recording of the right stereo track:""She used to be
assistant"" and ""There were two men..."" Neither is clear enough or
long enough to be convincing. Some of the music, including the
recurring theme, sounds more natural in reverse.
     ""Turn me on, dead man"" is a typical phonetic reversal. The
forward ""number nine"" (repeated throughout the cut) is clear; the
reversal is slurred -- something like ""turn me on dedmun."" It has
been claimed that ""number nine"" must be pronounced with a British
accent or with some careful inflection in order to reverse to
""Turn me on, dead man."" This seems not to be so. As an experiment,
three American-accent renderings of ""number nine"" were reversed.
All sound about as much like ""Turn me on, dead man"" as the record
did. Like the other phonetic reversals, ""Turn me on, dead man""
must be considered a coincidence.
     Much of ""Revolution 9"" is on one stereo track only. Near the
end a voice says ""A fine natural imbalance...the Watusi...the
twist...Eldorado...Eldorado."" ""A fine natural imbalance"" is on the
right track only, though the words that follow are in stereo. One
of the longer bits of speech -- ""Who could tell what he was
saying? His voice was low and his [unintelligible] was high and
his eyes were low"" -- is clear on the left track, a bare whisper
on the right.
     There is a stereophonically concealed ""secret message"" on
""Revolution 9."" The words are on the right track. They begin about
four minutes, fifty-eight seconds into the cut and run for about
twenty-two seconds. They are not likely to be noticed in stereo
because of the much louder left track. The sound of applause
begins on the left track at about five minutes, one second into
the cut. Deafening noises -- the clapping, sirens, music --
continue on the left track until five minutes, forty seconds. It
may or may not have been Lennon's and Ono's intention to conceal
the spoken passage. Given the haphazard quality of ""Revolution 9,""
the concealment may have been accidental. To recover the passage,
the left track must be switched off. The right track can then be
heard to contain a sound like a stopwatch ticking, behind these
words:

     So the wife called, and we better go to see a
     surgeon....[A SCREAM MUFFLES A LINE THAT SOUNDS LIKE
     Well, what with the prices, the prices have snowballed,
     no wonder it's closed.] ...So any and all, we went to
     see the dentist instead, who gave him a pair of teeth,
     which wasn't any good at all. So instead of that he
     joined the bloody navy and went to sea.
                      by William Poundstone
                              1986

     There really are backward messages on rock albums. And the
controversy over ""backward masking"" and ""porn rock"" has inspired a
whole new spate of messages. There may have been more genuine
backward messages in the past few years than ever before.
     The backward message controversy is usually traced to the
1960s and John Lennon's avant-garde sound mixing on such tracks as
""Revolution 9"" on the Beatles' WHITE ALBUM. Lennon probably wasn't
trying to conceal a message so much as create an interesting
sound.
     The matter might have ended right there had it not been for
the Paul McCartney death rumor. College kids tried playing Beatles
records forward, backward, and at various speeds to find ""clues""
to McCartney's fate. In the process they found snippets of speech
from Lennon's experiments. Even after McCartney was found safe and
sound in Scotland, some listeners continued to look for hidden
messages.
     Somehow, fundamentalist Christian groups became convinced
(ca. 1982) that the alleged messages were commercials for devil
worship. Not a single indisputable satanic message has turned up,
but there were scattered attempts to ban or label certain albums.
In 1986 one fundamentalist group announced that the theme song for
the old MR. ED TV show contains the word ""Satan"" when played
backward.)
     Ironically, the publicity accorded nonexistent messages has
inspired several artists -- among them porn rock hearing witness
Frank Zappa -- to hide real background messages in their music.
It's easy to do.
     The performer speaks or sings the message normally, then
reverses the tape, which is mixed into the soundtrack. This is all
accomplished simply enough at any recording studio.
     What's not so simple is playing it back. More home record,
cassette, and compact disk players won't play backward. You can
turn a record backward with a pencil eraser, but it's not good for
the needle or the turntable. The only way to reproduce the message
with full fidelity is to use a professional-quality reel-to-reel
tape player and splice the tape in backward.
     We used the facilities of KLOS radio in Los Angeles to
reverse some recent records containing true backward messages.


""Secret Messages""
Electric Light Orchestra, SECRET MESSAGES

ELO's ELDORADO album was among those alleged to contain satanic
backward masked messages. A patient listening to ELDORADO played
backward reveals no such messages. You hear only what you ought to
hear -- the reversed lyrics of the songs, which sound nothing like
the ""messages"" claimed to be there. In the wake of such
allegations, ELO did put an (innocuous) backward message on their
FACE THE MUSIC album. Perhaps they thought this would show how
silly the allegations were. Instead, the backward-masking people
seized on this as proof that the other ""messages"" were real. In
the latest volley, ELO has named an album after the controversy.
     In Britain (where the backward-masking issue is viewed as an
American eccentricity), the cover of SECRET MESSAGES has a mock
warning label to youth about the hidden label. Word of the albums'
impending release in the United States caused enough of a furor to
chill CBS Records into deleting the cover blurb.
     The reversed message is easy to find. It's at the beginning
of the first song, which is itself called ""Secret Messages."" You
can hear reversed speech when you play the record normally. A
voice intones ""secret messages"" -- forward -- in the middle of the
reversed speech, lest anyone dare be so unhip as to not know
what's going on.
     We transferred a new copy of SECRET MESSAGES to reel-to-reel
tapes and played it backward. The backward message goes: ""WELCOME
TO THE BIG SHOW/ WELCOME TO THE BIG SHOW.""
     That's it.


""Ya Hozna""
Frank Zappa, THEM OR US

""Ya Hozna,"" a six-minute composition on the first record of the
THEM OR US double album, is ENTIRELY backward. The albums' inner
cover, which includes lyrics for the other songs, says, ""backwards
vocal -- you figure it out"" of this cut. It credits Frank and Moon
Zappa, George Duke, and Napoleon Murphy Brock as vocalists.
     Played forward, ""Ya Howza"" sounds like a record played
backward -- reasonably so. The vocals are prominent and
unintelligible. Moon Zappa's voice is curiously recognizable, even
in reverse. It is hard to tell whether the music was recorded
forward or backward.
     When ""Ya Howza"" is played in reverse, you discover that the
music is virtually a palindrome -- it sounds about the same
forward and backward. The voices are all backward. In some cases
they have been modified electronically. Many of the words are
muffled. Even after repeated careful listening on both stereo
tracks, it is difficult to make out many of the lyrics. It doesn't
help that some of the words seem to be stream-of-consciousness
nonsense. Some of the unintelligible stuff sounds like opera.
     Starting at the beginning of the reversed tape -- the end of
the forward tape -- the clearer vocals go like this: ""I am the
heaven, I am the water."" This is in a hymnlike register. ""You are
a lonely little girl./ But your mommy and your daddy hold you."" A
singsong synthesizer voice.
     The most interesting part of the lyrics is an intermittently
orgasmic rap in Moon Zappa's Valley Girl voice. There are three
short monologues:

I'm like green!
I'm like squat!
I'm like soul!
Repeat, like soul!
I'm like pull, push,
Okay, like slow, slow.

You're never too old
Like slow, like slow, like slow
Okay, I like it.


All right, faster, faster,
Go, do it, do it twice,
Yeah, that feels good,
I'm looking great,
Yeah, fer shure!
Like, no way!


""No Anchovies, Please""
J. Geils Band, LOVE STINKS

""No Anchovies, Please"" is a novelty song, really a narration with
sound effects, about a woman who is kidnapped after eating
anchovies. She is taken to a ""foreign-speaking"" country. The sound
effect of the foreign tongue seems reversed. When you do play it
in reverse, it becomes: ""It doesn't take a genius to know the
difference between chicken shit and chicken salad.""


""Darling Nikki""
Prince, PURPLE RAIN

""Darling Nikki,"" cited as porn rock before Congress, is about a
dominatrix in a hotel lobby masturbating with a magazine. In part,
the complaint was that the album cover (flowers, and Prince on a
motorcycle) wasn't explicit enough to warn kids of the suggestive
lyrics. Senator Paula Hawkins apparently was not aware of a
backward message hidden in ""Darling Nikki."" The last thirty-five
seconds of the song is gibberish. The music changes abruptly and
becomes a repeated glottal sound. Then a two-syllable sound is
repeated twice, something like ""heaven, heaven."" Unintelligible
speech follows. At the end is a sound reminiscent of rain or bacon
frying , and wind sounds.
     Played backward, the message becomes:

     Hello, how are you?
     I'm fine 'cause I know that the Lord is coming soon.
     Coming, coming soon.

     It is clearly Prince and the Revolution singing this. The
words are clear but the intonation is funny -- the linger on some
words. Perhaps this is to make the reversed message you hear
playing the record normally a little less conspicuous.
     This is a weird reversal of the supposed secret message
menace. Raunchy forward lyrics conceal a religious secret message.


""Judas Kiss""
Petra, MORE POWER TO YOU

Petra is an obscure group that sings religious songs to a rock
beat. As further proof that things have gone full circle, the
backward-masking controversy prompted Petra to include a wholesome
backward message on their MORE POWER TO YOU album. It is in the
transition between two songs, just before ""Judas Kiss."" Clearly
audible gibberish reverses to this (the husky voice a cross
between George Beverly Shea and Dee Snider): ""What are you looking
for the Devil for, when you ought to be looking for the Lord?""

AFL JoyceM Welcome to the Apple II Music & Sound chat - our discussion will
           be on NoiseTracker - the new FTA music program for the GS.  AFA
           Gene will be our host this evening...Gene, the floor is yours :)

AFA Gene   Hi all... well first I'd like to point out, if y'all aren't aware
           yet, that a spanking new version of NoiseTracker has recently
           been released (9 days ago) and is now available in our New Files
           library. It is version 0.5. I haven't played around with it much
           yet, but it's supposed to fix a lot of the little bugs in 0.3
           (the first version we had online).  NoiseTracker also includes
           the ability to directly import ""modules,"" a term used for a
           certain type of Amiga song file which has become popular among PC
           users using the SoundBlaster sound card.

           Now, via NT, these ""MOD"" files are accessible by the GS. We
           expect to see a lot of activity on this end as far as ports from
           the PC and Amiga go. Note that you should be able to go straight
           to the PC music forum and download any recently uploaded MOD
           songfiles (there was a bug in the first wide release of the PCAO
           software, however, so a bunch of files with dates between around
           March 1991 and September 1991 may not download properly. Note that
           to use these PC MOD files, you'll have to rename the downloaded
           file ""MOD.xxxxxx"" if you want it to show up automatically in NT's
           ""open"" dialog box. (On the PC, all MOD files are named
           ""xxxxxxxx.MOD"" instead.)   Also, if the files are packed with ZIP
           compression, you'll need a program from the Communications Forum
           called AGATE -- it's a terminal program that includes the ability
           to unpack ZIP files.

           Now, I guess the best thing to do would be to talk about our
           favorite songfiles... there have been a few complaints, in fact,
           that people were not being ""descriptive"" enough in their file
           descriptions for uploads in describing the songs.

AFC Eddie  ?

AFA Gene   GA ed

AFC Eddie  Once a MOD file is unpacked with Agate, is a file type change
           needed?

AFA Gene   Nope, since all that NT looks for is the ""MOD."" being the first
           four characters in the filename.

AFC Eddie  OK, Thanks!

Deanna7332 Question...

JonL7      Can you list some of the features of Noisetracker?

AFA Gene   (you don't even need that ""MOD."" if you want to type the name in
           directly.)

Deanna7332 Did any of these mod files have anything to do with FTA's ""Module
           A""

AFA Gene   Sure Jon, right after we answer Deanna's question. Deanna, you
           mean ""Modulae?""

Deanna7332 Yes, that's it.

AFA Gene   Modulae was a demo written by FTA last year. (i'll get to you in a
           sec Doors).  It used SoundSmith v0.95 for all it's music. There
           is no connection between MOD files and Modulae by FTA.

Deanna7332 Throughout the demo it said ""Loading modules""

AFA Gene   Those ""modules"" are not the same as Amiga soundfile ""modules"" --
           you see, what Modulae really was was a ""stringing together"" of a
           bunch of neat little tiny demos that FTA had written. So they
           called each little demo a ""module"" and thus the entire demo as a
           whole, ""Modulae"" (fancy plural of module?)

Deanna7332 Ok I understand.  Thank you. :)

AFL JoyceM Latin, Gene :)

AFA Gene   The term ""MODule"" from the Amiga comes from the idea that all the
           stuff needed to play the songfile (all the instruments + the
           sequence file) are included into one file, the ""module.""

TheDoors1  Gene, I have tried to d/l some recent uploaded MODs in the PC
           music area and still the problem exists.

AFA Gene   As I understand it, the problem was fixed VERY recently (correct
           me on this Joyce) and files uploaded as recently as early
           November still might not work depending on the version of the
           PCAO software that the uploader used.

AFL JoyceM Actually, Gene...I was under the impression that it had been, but
           if Doors is still having a problem, then it must not be fixed.

AFA Gene   What date was the file you tried to d/l, Door?

TheDoors1  umm 11/17, around there

AFA Gene   hmmm.... well i can tell you one thing... if it didn't work, don't
           waste your time again later... the problem is in the Apple
           software's method of d/lling files, and there are no plans to
           upgrade the Apple AO software.

AFL JoyceM I will endeavor to get an answer to that PC downloading
           problem/question :)

ThomasK63  i have a quick question... what can you use to unpack amiga mod
           files? On the PC side, that is.

TheDoors1  Agate Thomas

ELECTMUSIC Doors... what happens on after downloading..

Deanna7332 If it's LZHed you can't unless you have an IBM or
           PC/Transporter.

AFA Gene   If GS-ShrinkIt doesn't have that ability, i don't think there
           exists any such utility on the GS.

TheDoors1  What do you mean Elect?

ELECTMUSIC After you download the file... where do you encounter a problem?

TheDoors1  ok, you know when you download the file and at some point in the
           download the file starts to appear on your screen.  That's when I
           cancel it.

ThomasK63  I am sure soething good can be made w/out resorting to Amiga
           files

AFC Eddie  Yes, Doors, I believe the problem is with the PC software it was
           UL'd with.

TheDoors1  yeah Eddie.

GNO Tim    Amiga MOD files are typically compressed using LHarc.  I've
           uncompressed several on my Unix machine at school.

ThomasK63  good time for someone to make a lharc unpacker...

AFC DYAJim someone might be ;)

GNO Tim    Several people are already

AFC Eddie  Can't wait, Jim!

AFA Gene   Jon, did you have a question?

JonL7      The features of Noisetracker :)

AFA Gene   Oh yes... okay, here goes, in a nutshell, from most important to
           least:


AFA Gene   *  ability to import MOD files

           *  ability to import Soundsmith files

           *  ProDOS 8 based

           *  virtually no editing abilities (not a feature but important to
           know)

AFC DYAJim :)

AFA Gene   *  forgot: and the most important feature of all, the ability to
           hold instrument files in regular system RAM instead of DOC RAM,
           allowing for instruments far beyond the regular 64K limit found
           in ALL other GS music programs.

ThomasK63  I'll buy that!

TheDoors1  I have another question...when you're ready.

AFA Gene   GA Doors

TheDoors1  ok..is it true that NoiseTracker will take in soundsmith files and
           play them more clearly

AFA Gene   Well, as far as ""what you hear,"" yes there is a definite
           difference with some instruments. It does NOT play the sounds
           more ""clearly,"" but it just plays them in a different way. What
           many people seem to like about this ""different way"" is that
           sustained instruments (i.e. instruments designed to be played
           in a loop to simulate a long held note) seem to work better (or
           perhaps simply the way they were originally intended to work).

TheDoors1  I see

Deanna7332 Which takes up more space - MOD or NT  w/soundfile ?

AFA Gene   Deanna, it depends a few things, such as how big the sequence is,
           how many instruments you have, etc. Once you have a lot of
           assorted files, it'll probably average out to be about the same
           give or take a hundred blocks on your HD. So it basically depends
           on whether you prefer to have your instruments separate or not.

Deanna7332 Does playing quality differ with either one ?

AFA Gene   Nope. It's exactly the same either way. Loading time is the same
           too.

AFC Eddie  Can NT save songs as MOD files?

AFA Gene   Nope. It has options for Open and Close module, but these are
           still inactive.

AFA Gene   If there are no more questions, I'd like to talk about which NT
           files out there are the ""hottest,"" since this info could be
           useful to many users who are interested in downloading NT/MOD
           files.

           My personal favorite is ""Lambada,"" which is supplied by FTA with
           the program but is available separately on America
           Online.Everything about this file is really impressive except
           perhaps the sound quality of the horn-ish melody instrument.

           What about y'all, what are your favorite NT files?

AFL JoyceM Gene, there is a classical song for NT, but can't remember the
           name, but it is good.

AFC Eddie  I like Dragnet!

ELECTMUSIC So do I Ed

TheDoors1  I like Seven something

Deanna7332 My most favorite of all mod files is Pleasure Principle

AFC Eddie  <--appreciate's Greg's taste!

AFL JoyceM :)

AFA Gene   Deanna, i assume you got that from a local board?

Deanna7332 I got it from the PC forum here.

TheDoors1  I saw it there also

Deanna7332 I think under ""Pleasure""

AFA Gene   Would you be able to upload it here? If it's really that good, we
           ought to have it available directly in our oun NT lib here (BTW
           folks, we will be releasing a new NoiseTracker software library
           soon!)

AFC Eddie  What a Forum!!!

Deanna7332 That sounds great!

AFL JoyceM Gene, do you think it will be possible for synthLAB files to be
           converted to MOD files?

AFL JoyceM MOD files?

AFA Gene   I doubt it, Joyce. The formats are so diametrically opposed in
           their entire basis of their file formats that it wouldn't be
           worth the time for a programmer to develop such a convertor.

Deanna7332 Isn't it possible to move the mod file from the PC forum to our
           music library?

AFA Gene   But..... it might be worth the time for a MIDI File Format to MOD
           convertor, since these two formats are more widely accepted.

Nuzz       they have nothing better to do Gene

ELECTMUSIC Gene.. some interesting similarities with DTune and NTracker

AFA Gene   They lose the file, tho, Deanna. :)

AFL JoyceM In what way, Greg?

ELECTMUSIC Both Prodos 8

Deanna7332 Shhh they won't know a thing :)

ELECTMUSIC I also believe Bill uses a shuttling of sound data between Doc
           Ram and Ram.

AFC Eddie  Interesting, Greg.

ELECTMUSIC Thats how he gets some of the excellent instrument quality

AFC Eddie  But Diversitune has that one distinction:  MIDI input.

AFL JoyceM Deanna, we would greatly appreciate it if you would upload that
           'Pleasure' song to our library :)

ELECTMUSIC Agreed Ed.. one of the factors FTA doesn't like to incorporate
           into their programs.

Deanna7332 I'll u/l it tonight if possible.

AFL JoyceM Thanks :)

AFC Eddie  Thanks, Deanna!

AFL JoyceM I will send Bill B a copy of NoiseTracker + some MOD files...to
           see what comments we get from him (will send when I get back).

AFC DYAJim What ever happened to that diversitune upgrade that was talked
           about ?

ELECTMUSIC That would be interesting Joyce

AFC Eddie  Bill apparently still working on it, Jim.

ELECTMUSIC I am sure he would appreciate the Prodos 8

AFC DYAJim good..

AFL JoyceM Jim...RSN....he was hoping by Christmas (this year), but he is
           soooo busy with his job, who knows?

AFC DYAJim Oh yeah, I noticed the speed calcuation in NT .5 is inaccurate
           :)

AFC DYAJim I recall he has set a lot of Christmas projected dates :)

ELECTMUSIC He was one of the first ""Free Tools"" experts in breaking all the
           rules for economic sake.

AFC DYAJim like for the vaporware DT inst editor like 2 years ago.

Deanna7332 Are there any Christmas Mod or NT songs?

AFC Eddie  Oh yeah, Diversi-Editor!

AFL JoyceM I know, Jim - but that I know he has been working on.

AFC DYAJim he projected Christmas for it, and it never came :)

AFA Gene   Not yet in AMS, but hopefully the Holiday Contest will change all
           that. :)

AFC DYAJim I look foreward to any upgrades..

AFL JoyceM Not that I am aware of Deanna - you have some?  hint, hint

Deanna7332 Nope sorry.  I was hoping there were some that could be u/led
           here

AFC DYAJim I'll be breaking out the xmas tune book rsn.. I should be able to
           midi a few :) (which rules out nt)

AFL JoyceM Question...

AFC Eddie  It would be more appropriate to have a converter from Appleworks
           spreadsheet to MOD than from MIDI!

AFL JoyceM If I got ahold of an Amiga song (MOD) disk...how would I convert
           them for here?

AFA Gene   You mean an Amiga-formatted disk?

AFL JoyceM Yes

AFC DYAJim Ack.. methinks you need an amiga and a null modem cable or a
           modem.

AFA Gene   Methinks Jim is right

AFC DYAJim LOL!!  Design your music in the spreadsheet then import to NT :)
           IT might actually have better editing?!! :)

AFC Eddie  Right!

AFL JoyceM Me thinks he is right.  If I had them upload to me, would that
           work?

AFA Gene   Yep; should work like a charm.

AFC DYAJim Yah.. as long as they're coming from an amiga

AFL JoyceM Great....I will work on that when I get back  (making note now).

AFL JoyceM Gene, will you get some of those files (NT) sent to that area
           tonight?  If so, I will leave the needed message :)

AFA Gene   That's all I have planned for tonight's chat, Joyce. Yep, I'll
           move some files right now.

AFL JoyceM Thanks...

AFL JoyceM Then we should have our NoiseTracker Library by end of the week in
           AMS :)

ELECTMUSIC Gene... quick question:  Are you launching NTracker from a 3.5
           disk?

AFL JoyceM Okay, guys...I will see you all the week of December 11th (may the
           4th) as I am off on vacation.

AFA Gene   Yep greg

AFC JohnC  Where are you going?

ELECTMUSIC Do you encounter out of memory problems

AFL JoyceM Night all...and Gene, thanks for an excellent chat and great
           explanations of NoiseTracker.

Nuzz       Joyce, I have good news for FutureSound owners. SoundConvert will
           support it in the first release

AFC Eddie  Great, Mike!

AFA Gene   Greg, i always keep my RAMdisk at 0 when using noisetracker. Not
           only are

AFC JohnC  Mike...SoundConvert...released?

AFL JoyceM Great, Mike.  When can we get SoundConvert, Mike? and FutureSound
           :)

AFA Gene   there a couple of bugs with memory management, but if you're
           loading in a MOD file that's really big, NT will eat your RAMdisk.

AFC Eddie  Sounds good.

Nuzz       The manual is being ""layout"". Release date should be about 1st
           week of Dec

ELECTMUSIC Tnxs Gene

AFC JohnC  YES.......WTG Nuzz!!!!!!!!

Deanna7332 Yes, why is there on some MOD files a stop somewhere in the middle
           ?

Deanna7332 That's really frustrating!

AFL JoyceM Mike, leave me E-Mail on when and how I can send your the $$ to
           get it.

AFL JoyceM Again...night all

Nuzz       gee John, I had to do something to explain the delay :)

ELECTMUSIC Thanks Gene for a GREAT chat!

AFC Eddie  Yes, Gene!  Great!

AFA Gene   Thanks Greg, 'night!

AFA Gene   thanx, see y'all later :)

Copyright 1987 Bob Szekely.

    John Michael Osbourne, (known as ""Ozzy"" to his fans), has in his long 
career as vocalist for Black Sabbath had his work with the group misconstrued 
as advocating Satanism.  In a 1983 radio special featuring Ozzy, the 
interviewer expressed precisely this point; ""...Ozzy has always been shrouded 
in the darkest of Satanic imagery.  Yet if you really listen to his music, 
you'll find that what he is saying differs greatly from his image....""(1)  Even 
the group's image has often been described as ""occult and diabolic"".(2)

    The important point to remember here is to differentiate between appearance 
and reality.  Although the name ""Black Sabbath"" conjures up images of witches 
and sorcerers paying homage to Satan for the powers bestowed upon them, this 
does not make it safe to assume that the group that went by this name 
necessarily drew the inspiration from the occult.(3)  The closest they ever 
came to it was a gothic horror film featuring Boris Karloff as narrator; they 
adopted their name directly from the name of this film.(4)  Black Sabbath was 
involved in the black arts as much as Karloff practiced casting spells off-
screen.  Tony Iommi, the group's guitarist, summed it up best when he described 
the group as having basically ""...the same appeal as a horror movie.  It's all 
an act.""(5)










    Just as their film counterpart did, Ozzy and Sabbath found the occult 
mythos to be an effective vehicle for powerful social commentary; particularly 
when put in the context of heavy-metal rock and roll.  Ozzy himself noted that 
there are ""...people who pick up my [album] cover[s] and go...'This guy's got 
to be singing about Devil, doom, death and destruction.'  Which is not the 
case....""(6)

    The late Lester Bangs likened the group to Bob Dylan and William Burroughs, 
describing them all as ""...moralists...trying to deal with a serious present 
situation in an honest way....""(7)  Ozzy and Black Sabbath merely bring to 
light the many evils of our world in their work, to try and make us realize 
that we are all victim to their influence.  They hope to make us recognize 
these evils so that we may take up arms against them; a point Ozzy emphatically 
stresses:  ""...one thing everybody has got to understand about Black Sabbath's 
lyrics.  They're not downer lyrics, they're just telling everybody where it's 
at...""(8)  He also cites the group's most controversial tune, ""Black Sabbath"", 
as a response to the ignorant hippie culture still force when the tune was 
written in 1970:  ""The hippies said: 'The world is beautiful man.' (sic)  You 
only had to look around you to see how crappy it was.  It was ridiculous 
listening to that stuff, let alone playing it, so we just wrote about the world 
the way it really was and how it affected us - and we felt better in ourselves 
because we were really being honest....""(9)

        5   IS GOD JUST A THOUGHT WITHIN YOUR HEAD OR IS
        6   HE A PART OF YOU?

        32  SAY YOU DON'T BELIEVE?
        33  YOU HAD THE CHANCE BUT YOU TURNED IT DOWN
        34  NOW YOU CAN'T RETRIEVE.










    VI  35  PERHAPS YOU'LL THINK BEFORE YOU SAY THAT
        36  GOD IS DEAD AND GONE
        37  OPEN YOUR EYES, JUST REALIZE THAT HE IS THE
        38  ONE.
        39  THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN SAVE YOU KNOW FROM
        40  ALL THIS SIN AND HATE.
        41  OR WILL YOU STILL JEER AT ALL YOU HEAR?
        42  YES!-I THINK IT'S TOO LATE.

    In this piece, the group asserts a belief in an afterlife and spiritual 
redemption.  As grisly as the image of a hanged pontiff is, its shock value is 
a necessary part of the message:  They reject religious dogma, stating that a 
belief in God, in one's own heart, is the only guiding light to help one inn 
his life (lines 11/12, 39/40).  Furthermore, the reject religious hypocrisy 
(lines 5/6, 7/8) and peer pressure (verses III, IV) as excuses for not 
accepting God.  To clarify further:  following the crowd does not justify 
shrugging responsibility for one's own actions.

    After re-reading, it becomes obvious that this song is an ascerbic critique 
of atheism; (line 35/36) I refer here again to verses three and four.  In these 
two verses, the picture painted in one of Godless conformity and how it's 
viewed as being as foolish as Paganism.  These lyrics set an example for the 
listener by relating personal experience (lines 13-16).  However, for those who 
cannot accept this the group has no recourse but to condemn them, although 
rather ironically; they hope that their rhetorical loss of faith in the 
listener will open his eyes (line 42).










                           B L A C K   S A B B A T H 



            WHAT IS THIS, THAT STANDS BEFORE ME?
            FIGURE IN BLACK, WHICH POINTS AT ME
            TURN ROUND QUICK AND START TO RUN
            FIND OUT I'M THE CHOSEN ONE.  OH, NO!
            
            BIG BLACK SHAPE WITH EYES OF FIRE
            TELLING PEOPLE THEIR DESIRE
            SATAN'S SITTING THERE, HE'S SMILING
            WATCHES THOSE FLAMES GET HIGHER AND HIGHER
            OH, NO, NO, -- PLEASE GOD HELP ME!
            
                IS THIS THE END MY FRIEND?
                SATAN'S COMING 'ROUND THE BEND
                PEOPLE RUNNING 'CAUSE THEY'RE SCARED
                THE PEOPLE BETTER GO AND BEWARE
                NO, NO!  PLEASE--NO!!
                
                
    The all time controversy winner!  Is this not irrefutably  THE song about 
Black Magic in rock?  It's all so obvious, suffuse with evil imagery; Satan, 
walls of flame, figure in black, and damnation at the end.  Yes, I see the 
images too; it definitely concerns Black Magic.  Then again, Shakespeare's 
Macbeth employed scenes of witches involved in conjurations; does that mean 
that Shakespeare was a warlock?  Poe used to write sardonic tragedies about 
twisted murderers and the bizarre nature of acts, did that make him an evil, 
leering, demented killer?  Did either of them advocated what they wrote about?  
One has to remember that writing about something is not necessarily the same as 
emulating it.  Tony Iommi spoke out quite strongly about this:  ""People are 
bringing us down saying that we are a Black Magic group.  I think they must be










getting mixed up with Black Widow.  We don't do any sacrifices on stage, and 
we're not on a black magic kick.  We wanted to do heavy numbers and the guitar 
riffs we worked out were more suited to evil things than love.  We play songs 
about black magic, but they are more likely to be against than for it.""(12)  

    By now, you're probably asking yourself who Black Widow is, right?  Then 
it's time for a little history:

        Sabbath, before they were known as Sabbath, had the same line-up but 
two earlier names.  The first one was Polka Tulk, which seemed sure to doom 
them to obscurity.(13)  The soon realized this and changed the group's name to 
Earth.  Now, Earth was a blues band at the end of the English blues boom.  As 
if that wasn't bad enough, they soon discovered that not only was there another 
group named Earth, but they had also released a single.  To avoid confusion, 
they changed their name again.(14)  But what made them decide on that name?  
Just ask Ozzy:  ""I just liked the name Black Sabbath because of the succession 
of vowel sounds.(15)  If that sounds ludicrous just consider this:  Sabbath was 
""...the first of the really committed, loud and heavy bands...""(16)  They 
needed a name to match the gut-wrenching power they were developing.  Tony knew 
that he wanted Sabbath to be noticed above all the rest of the British blues 
bands:  ""We wanted something of our own that we'd like and people would like.  
And we wanted something loud!""










    Tony didn't hate the blues.  He'd cut his teeth as a guitarist on the likes 
of The Shadows, Buddy Holly and Django Rheinhardt, developing his own style 
from there.  But he realized the group had no future in the blues:

        'We couldn't keep playing 12-bars forever.  We just got fed up with 
Earth music.  It was jazz, blues stuff.  It was good for practice but nothing 
else.'

    In the late 'Sixties, blues groups were a dime a dozen in Birmingham and 
interest was waning in the blues boom due to the glut of groups.  One man, by 
the name of Jim Simpson, had heard Earth around the Birmingham club circuit and 
understood what they were trying to do.  He decided to take them under his 
wing.  With the aid of his massive record collection, Jim expanded the group's 
horizons in the areas of jazz and blues.  He introduced them to artists like 
Wes Montgomery, Count Basie and Jimmy Rushing.  It was from Rushing in 
particular that they derived the repetitive riff style so readily noticeable in 
their later incarnation as Black Sabbath.

    The Count Basie influence is evidenced in the song ""Wicked World"" from the 
first album; Sabbath drummer Bill Ward uses a ""'sighing hi-hat'...in the manner 
of Basie's drummer Jo Jones.""










    The influence is subtle, almost subliminal.  Yet it is one which was not 
thought capable of hard, 'heavy' rock bands in the late 'Sixties.  Although Led 
Zeppelin and Jimi Hendrix also had their work steeped in blues and jazz 
derivations (Hendrix' ""Third Stone From the Sun"" and Zeppelin's version of 
Willie Dixon's ""I Can't Quit You Baby"" from their first album), neither was 
able to match the intense energy of Black Sabbath.  Iommi has always had a 
preference for music with an original, distinct style of its' own; as an 
example, he mentions guitarists Joe Pass and Alvin Lee as two of his strongest 
songwriting influences.

    It would also be necessary that Sabbath develop a unique, distinctive style 
and image of their own.  Though they had changed their name from Earth to Black 
Sabbath to avoid confusion with the other Earth; at the same time another group 
emerged by the name of Black Widow ""...who WERE profoundly influenced by the 
occult, had a male witch as a patron, and wrote pieces like ""Come to The 
Sabbat.""  Unfortunately, Sabbath was constantly reaping the benefits of Widow's 
publicity.

    Sabbath was a group that never minced words.  If they saw something as 
destructive, they would be sure to rub the listener's face it it.  They did not 
want their point to be missed.

    With their straightforward, sometimes brutal way of looking at things, they 
try to shock the listener's conscience back into awareness.  The imagery of 
""Hand of Doom"", from the Paranoid album, is candid and condemning; it is a 
strong statement against drug addiction and rightly so...

    Many people felt the group's overall direction was pessimistic and had a 
negative effect on its listener's due to that.  ""Ozzy insisted that if people 
thought he was having a bad effect on the minds of young kids, they should go 
and watch the TV news where real murder and mayhem were a way of life, and 
shown night after night."" (18)

    Sabbath was never negative in their message; they were simply truthful 
about waht they saw as wrong in the world.  If you ""Strip away the horror 
stories, the imagery and the hysteria, (and) turn down the amps a notch...you 
have a well-rehearsed, solid blues and rock band, powered by a dedication to 
well defined objectives.""  On the top of the list of those objectives was 
truth; Sabbath never feared facing that truth squarely, regardless of what many 
people thought of them.

Long, long, time ago,
I can still remember,
When the local calls were ""free"".
And I knew if I paid my bill,
And never wished them any ill,
That the phone company would let me be...

But Uncle Sam said he knew better,
Split 'em up, for all and ever!
We'll foster competition:
It's good capital-ism!

I can't remember if I cried,
When my phone bill first tripled in size.
But something touched me deep inside,
The day... Bell System... died.

And we were singing...

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

Is your office Step by Step,
Or have you gotten some Crossbar yet?
Everybody used to ask...
Oh, is TSPS coming soon?
IDDD will be a boon!
And, I hope to get a Touch-Tone phone, real soon...

The color phones are really neat,
And direct dialing can't be beat!
My area code is ""low"":
The prestige way to go!

Oh, they just raised phone booths to a dime!
Well, I suppose it's about time.
I remember how the payphones chimed,
The day... Bell System... died.

And we were singing...

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

Back then we were all at one rate,
Phone installs didn't cause debate,
About who'd put which wire where...
Installers came right out to you,
No ""phone stores"" with their ballyhoo,
And 411 was free, seemed very fair!

But FCC wanted it seems,
To let others skim long-distance creams,
No matter 'bout the locals,
They're mostly all just yokels!

And so one day it came to pass,
That the great Bell System did collapse,
In rubble now, we all do mass,
The day... Bell System... died.

So bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

I drove on out to Murray Hill,
To see Bell Labs, some time to kill,
But the sign there said the Labs were gone.
I went back to my old CO,
Where I'd had my phone lines, years ago,
But it was empty, dark, and ever so forlorn...

No relays pulsed,
No data crooned,
No MF tones did play their tunes,
There wasn't a word spoken,
All carrier paths were broken...

And so that's how it all occurred,
Microwave horns just nests for birds,
Everything became so absurd,
The day... Bell System... died.

So bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

We were singing:

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?

But she's good enough for me.         So he's good enough for me!

Shall we sing in praise of Loki,      It was good enough for Odin
Though he left poor Midgard smokey?   Though the tremblin' got forbodin'

But he's good enough for me.          But it's good enough for me.

                      (Tune: ""Lily the Pink"")

   Now here's a story, a little bit gory,
   A little bit happy, a little bit sad.
   About a drink called Imperium Compound
   And how the SCA's been had!                       (1)

   Chorus: Oh we think, we think, we think,
           The King is a fink, a fink, a fink,
           A figure of respectability
           Rules the Kingdom thru Imperium Compound
           The results are plain to see!

   Duke Treegirtsea, was known for his courtesy,
   And his fighting prowess was well-renowned
   Took a thimble of Imperium Compound
   And the poor Duke nearly drowned!                  (2)

   Words with Andy, you never should bandy
   He is strong enough to kill a moose
   He drinks copious Imperium Compound
   But he can't take Jungle Juice!                    (2)

   Meriwold, he's the bane of a Skald, he
   Has no attributes of which to sing
   Polite and formal, incredibly normal,
   Are you SURE he was the King?                       (3)

   Bearengaer(y) he lived solitary,
   From his presence folks would hide in fear
   Dipped his blade in Imperium Compound
   And now we're stuck with him this year!             

   Thaid Mak Tiessown, he taught us a lesson,
   And his praises now we sing,
   With the aid of Imperium Compound
   Any fool can be a King!                             (1)

   There was Al Frank, some thought him an old crank
   But a brilliant troubador and skald,
   Drank a toast with Imperium Compound
   Now he's prematurely bald!       //and married!//    (1)

   There was Roland, he wrote with a slow hand
   But in what he writes he does take pride
   Dipped his quill in Imperium Compound
   And took Wandor for a ride!      //for money!//      (2)

   Azarael, a melodious fellow
   Sings a song both sweet and terse,
   After drinking Imperium Compound,
   He gets verse and verse and verse!                    

   Hakan Redbeard, we thought him a bit wierd,
   We thought Vikings all were six foot four,
   Bathed his beard in Imperium Compound
   And he shrank right to the floor! //still singing!//  
2
   After Hakan, we sing of the KaKhan,
   And his Horde, which never seems to leave!
   They just smile at Imperium Compound,
   I wonder what is up his sleeve?   //wheet - thunk!//    

   AltChorus: Oh, we think, we think, we think,
              The Khan is a fink, a fink, a fink,
              A figure of incredibility
              Rules the Horde with Ghengis Compound
              With results that you can never see!

   Robert Asprin, pulled many a fast one
   On the Kingdom and its' Kings,
   So we all drank Imperium Compound
   Now we can stand the songs he sings! //oh, yeah?//    (4)

   But he was a Scot, you see,
   He took treatments of Imperium Compound,
   Now he's as wise as you or me!       //not likely!//   (1)

   Ol' Duke Siggie, a West Coast biggie,
   Didn't know enough for his own good!
   Threw a knife at Yang the Nauseating,
   And escaped with Brotherhood!                         (2)

   Kenneth of Cheviot, I haven't quite rhymed yet,
   But he has a fair and roving eye,
   When imbibing Imperium Compound
   He is never, ever, ever, shy!                         (2)

   Mongol Hordemen, those free-living swordsmen
   Subverting the Kingdoms from underneath!
   Have no use for Imperium Compound
   Except perhaps to brush their teeth!

   AltChorus: Oh we fink, we fink, we fink,
              The Khan and the Kink, the Kink, the Kink,
              And the Board, their Great Senilities!
              The Western Irgun, drinks Imperium Compound
              And we're BACK, with results you'll see!    (13)

              The King is a fink, a fink, a fink,
              A figure of delectability!
              Combs his hair with Imperium Compound
              The results are plain to see!

   Said Kevin Perigrynne, I've really got to win
   My fighting poem is three years old today
   Rubbed his pinions with Imperium Compound
   And brought an old grey wolf to bay!

   Kevin Perigrynne, they told him ""You'll never win!""
   You're just a falcon with a broken wing
   Rubbed his elbow with Imperium Compound

   And let's go Royalty-bedeviling!                         (5)

   Duchess Anna is quite a fan-a
   Going on a wartime shopping spree!  \\ War Point!\\
   Took a drink of Imperium Compound
   And shopped so fast we couldn't see! \\ Z-o-o-o-om!\\    (5)

   Lyn of Whitewolfe, made of the right stuff,
   Twice the Queen of Atenveldt;
   Took a drink of Imperium Compound
   And the Kingdom of Caid before her knelt!                (5)

   Duke Sir Brion, and Duke Sir Trelon,
   Won the Crown with regularity;
   Drank a lot of Imperium Compound,
   And founded a dynasty!                                   (5)

   Stephan von Geist, was most awful nice,
   And a chivalrous fighter without any doubt
   Took a swig of Imperium Compound
   And won the Crown his first time out!                    (5)

   All the Crusadenes were big, but not mean,
   And the finest fighters in the town.
   But they all drank Jerusalem Compound,
   Winning Crown after Crown after Crown!                   (5)

   Good Duke Arthur couldn't get no farth-er
   A Norman King in Aten Land
   Drank too much of Imperium Compound
   And went off to conquer Engel-land!                      (5)

   Then King Richard, a bit of a bitch, heard
   A King's Crown could be done.
   Drank a little Imperium Compound
   And became the Aten King, first one!                     (5)

   There was Astra, no one ever asked her
   And she was for having fun!
   Then she sampled Imperium Compound,
   And today she is a nun   \\ not better!\\               (19)

   There's good old Igor, his prowess is meager
   For he never learned to water-ski!
   But instead he drinks Imperium Compound
   Then he howls and climbs a tree!  \\Hoo Hah!\\          (19)

   Then there's Dagan, his brother's the Ka-Khan,
   Which is quite funny in a King!
   If he gets hooked on Imperium Compound
   There'll be new songs to sing!    \\ Oh, really?\\       (19)  

   Fredrick of Holland, who dwells in the Northland,
   A Master from the West, he came!
   Spends all his money for Imperium Compound
   That's why his garb's always the same!                   (20)

   Now Gyrth Oldcastle, round as a beer barrel,
   Once chose to quarrel with a certain Bard;
   The poet served him with Imperium Compound,
   And left him rendered down to lard!                      (20)

   Many tales abound of Imperium Compound
   And its' strange effects on Royalty,
   But after an hour, this song has no power,
   And by now, it's boring ME!                             (16)

   Duchess Malinda, who doesn't do windas
   But she does a lot of Duchess Things,
   But give her a LOT of Imperium Compound,
   And she sings and sings and sings and sings and sings!   (5)

   AltChorus: Oh it's too long, too long, too long
              To sing the whole song, the song, the song
              Longer than a Royal Court, it is!
              But sing it serial, this ditty Imperial
              And you'll be a bardic whiz!                 (5)

                                             IMPERIUM COMPOUND    
                                             (Atenveldt Verses)

   Now here's a story, a little bit gory,
   A little bit happy, a little bit sad.
   About a drink called Imperium Compound
   And how the SCA's been had!                       

   Chorus: Oh we think, we think, we think,
           The King is a fink, a fink, a fink,
           A figure of respectability
           Rules the Kingdom thru Imperium Compound
           The results are plain to see!

   Mongol Hordemen, those free-living swordsmen
   Subverting the Kingdoms from underneath!
   Have no use for Imperium Compound
   Except perhaps to brush their teeth!

   AltChorus: Oh we fink, we fink, we fink,
              The Khan and the Kink, the Kink, the Kink,
              And the Board, their Great Senilities!
              The Western Irgun, drinks Imperium Compound
              And we're BACK, with results you'll see!    

   Lady Laurel, with Authority Royal,
   Passes and rejects our heraldry
   She needs a swig of Imperium Compound
   Then perhaps she'd deign to talk to me!            

   Lady Trude thought it her duty
   To turn a social wrong into a Right
   Proved her point with Imperium Compound
   And showed that Cheshire Cats can fight!  //and scratch//

   The Board of Directors styled themselves The Electors
   And another con they tried to swing
   Now the BoD drinks Imperium Compound
   So we no longer need a King!                        

   AltChorus: Oh the Bod, the BoD, the BoD,
              It thinks it is God, is God, is God,
              The figure of Supreme Authority!
              And if we O.D.'d on Imperium Compund
              there'd be no need for Royalty!          

   Oh, MEDIEVAL Net, we thought it was all wet
   With witty remarks, and other kinds of sass
   We'll feed our computers on Imperium Compound
   And BYTE the BoD right on its' righteous ass!         

   Good old Duncan was often drunken
   Chasing all the ladies fair
   He bathed himself in Imperium Compound
   Now he has a little savoir faire!                     

                    (more)


  ATEN IMPERIUM (cont.)

   Ioseph of Locksley, never changes his socks, he
   Runs around looking like a Cavalier,
   He stocked up on Imperium Compound
   And he has enough to last for years and years!        

   AltChorus: Oh they forgot, forgot, forgot
              The Locks-e-ly Plot, the Plot, the Plot!
              And it works the best when it is underground!
              It isn't a hassle for a green-and-white tassle
              They're the ones that BREW Imperium Compound!  

   Trelon of the Wood, he was very good, he
   Was a leader that had never been beat before;
   But Caid had Imperium Compound,
   And Imperial Roman Caid won the War!  //with help!//   

   In Tyr Ysgithr, it's regularly whispered there
   That the Kingdom is ruled over by a King    // What's THAT? //
   They're ""democratic"" and quite erratic....
   They've forgot the purpose of the whole damn thing!     

   King Sir Mark von, with his pretty white suit on,
   Rules the Kingdom both with Grace and Purity!
   He never touches Imperium Compound
   At least not where anyone else can see!               

   Duke Sir Deaton, was never beaten
   On the field, or in the drinking hall;
   At the Catbox War with Caid,
   Left thirty bodies piled against the wall!             

   Denis O'Titans was good at smitin'
   A Locksley Monster in every single way!
   Drank a little Imperium Compound
   And ATE Deaton's sword that day  // No! REALLY! //       

   Wotan the Mongoloid, a little bit paranoid,
   But a nice guy none the less;
   Drank a mess of Imperium Compound
   Now he's Justin du Roc, I confess!                       

   Then there's Duke Reynard, with a face like a St. Bernard
   Of the Dukes, he is the homliest
   He tends to toke up on Imperium Compound
   And go out and whomp on anybody's best!                   

   This song'll bedevil the folks at a revel,
   And most of the time it will annoy the King,
   So take a drink of Imperium Compound
   And let's go Royalty-bedeviling!                        

   Duchess Anna is quite a fan-a
   Going on a wartime shopping spree!  \\ War Point!\\
   Took a drink of Imperium Compound
   And shopped so fast we couldn't see! \\ Z-o-o-o-om!\\    (5)

   Duke Sir Brion, with his pretty white suit on,
   Is a model of goodness and purity
   Never touches Imperium Compound
(spoken:) And I'll sell ya seashore property in Yuma, too!  

   Optional last verse:

   Many tales abound of Imperium Compound
   And its' strange effects on Royalty,
   But after an hour, this song has no power,
   And by now, it's boring ME!

                recorded: CELTIC CIRCLE DANCE
                          WTP-0002C

        Last night I had the strangest dream in this bleak century
        I dreamed that people the world around believed in Chivalry

        I dreamed I saw a Kingly Crown enshrined in laurel leaves
        with Grace and Joy and Purity attendant at his feet

        I dreamed I saw the perfect Knight receive his accolade
        and minstrels sang and children laughed in some soft forest glade

        I dreamed I saw the finest thing that ever man could make
        grow great and strong and undefiled: Pray God I never wake!

        Last night I had the strangest dream in this bleak century
        I dreamed that people the world around believed in Chivalry

               (to the tune of ""Good King Wenceslaus"")

                Locksley Monsters never yield
                on the field of battle
                strike the helm and bash the shield
                make their eyeteeth rattle
                Bodies on the ground will lie
                bones will burst in sunder
                search for Locksleys' enemies:
                You'll find them six feet under!

                              SONG OF IVANOF

            There is a man who we know well that does the best he can
            but he's displayed in armour made of reticulated garbage cans!

            He looks so fine and fair and strong, oh how he plays the man
            and how it's prized, those galvanized, reticulated garbage cans

            The noblest Roman of them all, a good Praetorian
            a combatant who wears no pants, judst reticulated garbage cans!

            Like old Horatius at the Bridge, like the Legions of Valerian
            (O dearie me: those LOVELY knees!)
            and those reticulated garbage cans!

                         C. McCray Bethancourt

         (sung to the tune (obviously) of the 12 Days of Christmas)


1.           The first time I sent my device, The Heralds said to me

            ""It violates the Rule of Three""

2.           The next time I tried it, the Heralds said to me

            ""We changed the forms, and it violates the Rule of
             Three"".

3.           The third time I tried, and the Heralds said to me, 

            ""We upped the fees, we changed the forms, and it
             violates the Rule of Three"".

4.           Another time I tried and the Heralds said to me,
 
            ""We haven't got it, we upped the fees, we changed the 
             forms, and it violates the Rule of Three"".

5.           The fifth time I tried it, the Heralds said to me,  

            ""In a decision rendered by the College of Arms on
             August 1st, A.S. V it was decided that this style of
             heraldic design was not appropriate to the aims and 
             intentions of the Corporate Body. Holy! Holy! Holy! ""

 note: verse 5 is delivered in an extremely fast, mono-
       tone, similiar to a Gregorian Chant.

           "" ....we haven't got it, we upped the fees, we changed the forms,
             and it violates the Rule of Three.""

6.           I tried it a sixth time, and the Heralds said to me,

            ""We changed the rules, &c""

7.           A seventh time I tried and, the Heralds said to me,

            ""It's against the Rule of Tincture, we changed the
             rules, &c""

8.           I tried it once again and the heralds said to me,

            ""It's not a Period design, It's against the Rule of Tincture, We
             changed the rules, &c""

                                * more *



    Heralds Said To Me (cont.)

9.           I sent it in once more, and the Heralds said to me,

            ""We changed the rules again, It's not a Period design,
             it's against the Rule of Tincture, we changed the
             rules, &c""

10. (sung in cold anger)
             The LAST time I sent my device, the Heralds said to me

    (sung in a state of SMUG)
             ""Someone else has got it, &c""




              (nb: every single one of these reasons has been used by the
              CoA, at one point or another, to reject perfectly good
              heraldry, along with some even MORE stupid.  If the shoe 
              fits....................!!!!!!!!)

                        BUGS ON THE BARONESS
                        Tune: Waltzing Matilda
 
           or: Who was that Vermin I saw you with last, Knight?
   or: There may be Lice on all you Knice, but there ain't no Lice on me

           Once there was a Barony howling in the wilderness
           nestled in the Valley where the River doesn't flow
           and the folks were driven buggy by the insects in the Revel Hall
           Authenticity is wonderful, but this doesn't go!

                   Bugs on the Baroness, bugs on the Baroness!
                   That was the cry that you heard all the day
                   and the scratching can be heard from Ysgithr to Ered Sul
                   why did we come here? Let's go away!

           See them all a scratching, nestled in their armour tight
           the fleas have a melee team that's challenging the field!
           call Truly Nolen! Someone's gotta help us out!
           the crabs are nesting in our helms but we'll never yield!

                   (chorus)

           Dawn comes a-breaking, the bugs have won the Coronet...
           flea-infested Conan-clones in piles upon the lawn
           where is the Barony? The bugs have eaten everyone...
           termites got the stick-jocks, and all their sticks are gone!

                   (chorus)

                          tune: The West's Awake

                  For all the Lands where I have dwelt
                  Oh Atenveldt, Oh Atenveldt
                  till rivers burn and mountains melt
                  lest I forget my Atenveldt
                  From deserts stark to snow-capped peaks
                  from silent lakes and laughing creeks
                  sing: Oh let man find his heart's ease
                  on rocky plains
                  in desert breeze

                  For oft I thought of mighty men
                  who carved a Land with sword and pen
                  and lit a candle, burning bright,
                  that pierced the darkness; stirred the night!
                  tho some are gone their deeds remain
                  this sunny Crown without a stain
                  sing: Oh, their deeds were not in vain!
                  in sunlit days
                  and falling rain.....

                  So raise your banners, blazoned bright
                  Advance the Dream and Shine the Light!
                  in battle's crash and Revel's song
                  raise high the Flag and wave it long!
                  For all the Lands wherein I've dwelt
                  I love you best, my Atenveldt!
                  Sing: Oh the Joy that I have felt!
                  My Atenveldt

      What the use of wearing panties
      whalebone corsets of your Auntie's
      boxer shorts and other scanties
      best of all is nude
      there's such fun in going bra-less
      now that it's no longer lawless
      'specially if your figure's flawless
      best of all is nude
      nude is what you're born in
      shirts are never torn in
      underwear and lacy flimsies, garter belts and other whimsies
      yards of itchy cloth to put your form in
      ducks all do it, maidens rue it
      even ancient Picts in Britain blue it
      going naked's how to do it
      best of all is nude!

      If your garters aren't elastic
      tie them up in knots fantastic
      (panty hose is something drastic!)
      best of all is nude!
      If you're tired of wearing clotheses
      shed your garment 'mongst the roses
      never mind the old bluenoses
      best of all is nude!
      Nude is best for ducking!
      Worst for horses bucking!
      Moonlit nights will see such sights
          that are very best for fooling round
                              .....and elbows!
      Nudity is grand to see
       a well-known antidote to virginity
      take your clothes off and you'll see:
      best of all is nude!

                   once I talked to a great Grey Man
                   spun three times and said with a sigh
                   hadn't been for the Runes had his other eye!

                   Hi said the Lady, dressed in green
                   prettiest thing I've ever seen
                   she went down underneath the hill
                   and came back out of her own free will

                   Brian Boru, on Irish ground
                   walked three times the Island round
                   Norsemen came lookin for a fight
                   just another Irish Saturday night!

                   Hi said Lugh on the banquest night
                   a poet and a player and a good wheelwright
                   a harper and a warrior and none the least:
                   a Druid and he got in to the Feast!

                   Harold Haardrada's face was red!
                   Came to Britain and he wound up dead
                   Stamford Bridge is where he's found
                   got six feet of English ground

                   the Legion with it's Eagles bright
                   marched into the Pictish night
                   met them there upon the sand
                   gave em up to the Wicker Man!

                   eight-legged steed and hound of Hel
                   the one-eyed Man, he loves ya well
                   fire burn and fire spark
                   are you then feared of the dark?

                   The Circle forms, the Circle flows
                   the Circle goes where no man knows
                   Hail to the Lady, one in three:
                   Present is Past and Past is Me!

                   Rhiannon's Birds are still in flight
                   all thru the Day all thru the Night

                   Hi said the Lady dressed in white
                   sang the Day and sang the Night
                   sang the Land and sang the Sea
                   sang the Song, and then sang Me!

                                  From the misty crystal sea
                                  came the Lady to the lea
                                  Sword and Roses in Her Hand
                                  spread their seeds thruout the Land

                                  Came the Stag from oaken wood
                                  saw the Lady where she stood
                                  by the fire burning bright
                                  came to know his heart's delight!

               and kept our hands from Hellishe Crime
               and made us a Kingdom in their own good time

                    WEAPONS AT THE DOOR

 Being a Polemic concerning the alleged Custom of the West Kingdom concerning 
 checking your Weapons at the Door of the Revel Hall. As the Satire is the 
 Weapon of the Bard, this said Polemic is to be checked at the Door, along with 
 swords, knives, redheaded Ladies and other such Deadly Things.....

         As I roved out to Western Lands to take the Western Air
         I went into a Revel Hall and I saw a Twelfth Night there
         but I was halted at the gate by a Privy Consellor
                 (that's the man who tells the King of the West how to go to
                  the bath room!)
         who told me I would have to check my Weapons at the door

         As I, in my astonishment, stood hung on tenter-pegs
         a Knight came in whose Prouess hung down between his legs
         the Doorman grabbed a greatsword and he struck the Knight full sore
         and gave him a reciept; he left his weapon at the door!

         a Bard was next whose goodly Voice has entertained us all
         but he, too, was prevented from entering the Hall
         and told he could not carry deadly weapons on the floor
         he left his Voice and Harp among the weapons at the door

         a Master entered graciously, a man we all know well
         who holds a 3rd Dan Black Belt, tho this he'd never tell
         the Master struggled valiantly, the Master cursed and swore
         but he left his hands, and feet, as weapons at the door

         the company was jovial, altho a bit dismayed
         for lack of proper cutlery, down to the smallest blade
         for even teeth and fingernails, each can be used in War
         were cut, and pulled, and left behind, as weapons at the door!

         And has their King not loyal Knights that He must be afraid
         of brawling in his Hall and of Assassin's bloody blade?
         the Rights of Men to carry Arms at least WE'VE not foreswore
         and a POX on them that made the Rule of Weapons at the Door!

                           THE STREETS OF ANN ARBOR

               As I walked out thru the streets of Ann Arbor
               as I walked out thru Ann Arbor one day
               I spied a young Mongol all dressed in white linen
               all dressed in white linen and cold as the clay

               I then spied another, done in on the sidewalk
               along with just about six dozen more
               their wounds were all gaping, from mace and from braoadsword
               from claymore and cannon, all dripping with gore

               what caused this grave carnage, I cried to the Monglos
               oh pray what's the reason for this awful sight
               my answer came slowly from under the corpse-pile
               ""It seems that our bark is much worse than our bite.....""

               the answer continued from pale lips a-shaking
               we sang all our songs and believed them as true
               the Dark Horde could never be beaten in battle
               we thought this was what all good Mongols could do...

               we went down to Atenveldt all for to plunder
               ""too large to defend"" was our song every night
               but Atenveldt's different from East, West or Middle
               there, even the bushes have learned how to bite!

               the Clann stole our ponies, the Scraelings our foodstuffs
               we ran into axes in AtenViking hands
               our maidens ran off with one Richard of Arkham
               and we're all that's left to return to our lands

               MacChluarains and Monsters, Lockehaven and Foxmoor
               that Kingdom is BIG and its' fighters are MEAN!
               we fought and we lost, and fled back to Ann Arbor
               we all came back home with results that you've seen

               keep away from that Land with its' cactus and marshes
               it's no place for Mongols who are bent on War
               they count their blows well, but they strick them yet better
               he crawled into his Yurt, and fell, dead, on the floor.....

       tune: the song of the Cowardly Lion, Tin Woodsman and Scarecrow
             in the movie version of the Wizard of Oz

        (Enter the Scarecrow, who singeth:)

        My wife is always nagging; my Prowess it is lagging
        I can't do anything
        she has got a reason, but revenge is out of season
        Oh I wish I could be King!

        If I just had the Crown on, I'd always have a frown on
        and the Barons on a string
        Heads they would be rolling, the Board would be cajoling
        Oh if only I was King!

        I am very fed up with the way this group is set up
        Oh I'd change everything!
        they are so high and mighty with the way that they do fight-ey
        Oh, someday I'll be King!

        Tho my wife is melancholic, and very...vitriolic
        she's a wasp without a sting!
        I'd have to supervise her with a pack of tranquilizers
        If I only was a King......

        (the Tin Woodsman joineth him, and singeth:)

        I grew up kind of cocky, and rather big, and stocky
        and straight as any rod
        on the field I'm a battallion, with the Ladies I'm a stallion
        ...Oh they'd better make me God!

        The other boys are jealous they say I'm over-zealous
        they'd do better to applaud
        the things that I am giving to this Dream that we are living
        oh I wish they'd make me God!

        They say that I'm conceited, but I'm just badly treated
        by people and by BoD
        just think of what they're missing by My Majesty dismissing
        Oh they'd better make me God!

        (the Cowardly Lion creepeth forth, and singeth:)

        Oh I could be a fighter, a great and mighty smiter
        and be the perfect knight
        it's a great and nasty shame, and everyone's to blame
        oh I wish that I could fight!

        Song of the Three (cont.)

        I could be a Cavalier drinking wine and ale and beer
        and be a gorgeous sight
        but it would cost me too much money so it isn't very funny
        oh I wish that I could fight!                               

        Let me at 'em on the field, I would surely make them yield
        to my Power and my Might
        with rattan, shinai and rapier they would nevermore escape here
        If they'd only let me fight

                The Mongols invaded the Middle
                But the Middle did not want to play...

                  (eins - zwei - drei, but the Dark Horde wouldn't die!)

                      by William Poundstone
                              1983

     Two mentalities are at work here: 1960s rock fans and 1980s
fundamentalist Christians. The idea of phonographically concealed
messages dates from the Paul McCartney death scare of 1969. For
hard-core types, the secret-message rumors never really died. Avid
rock fans have auditioned ever album release since the late 1960s
for hidden nuances. Backward messages, barely audible messages,
and messages on one stereo track only have been alleged. At the
other end of the sociosensual spectrum, fundamentalist Christians
have gotten into the act. TV programs such as PRAISE THE LORD and
THE 700 CLUB have propagated rumors of a satanic plot in the
recording industry, no less, in which various albums conceal
""backward-masked"" demonic murmurings. If THAT sounds too spacey to
be taken seriously, consider that it was the fundamentalist groups
who were behind House Resolution 6363, a bill introduced in the
U.S. House of Representatives by Robert K. Dornan (R., Calif.) in
1982 to label all suspect records: ""WARNING: THIS RECORD CONTAINS
BACKWARD MASKING THAT MAKES A VERBAL STATEMENT WHICH IS AUDIBLE
WHEN THIS RECORD IS PLAYED BACKWARD AND WHICH MAY BE PERCEPTIBLE
AT A SUBLIMINAL LEVEL WHEN THIS RECORD IS PLAYED FORWARD."" In
February 1983, the Arkansas State Senate passed a similar record-
labeling bill by a vote of 86 to 0.
     Contributing to the quasi-occult status of these rumors is
the difficulty of checking them out on home audio equipment. You
pretty much have to take someone else's word for it, or dismiss
the rumors out of hand.
     From a technical standpoint, there are four simple ways to
conceal a verbal message on a recording. The most obvious is to
record the message at a very low volume. The message may then be
recovered by turning the volume up while playing the record or
tape. If the message is faint enough, though, noise levels of home
equipment may garble it. If the accompanying music or lyrics are
loud enough, or if the message itself is indistinct or
electronically modified, it may be hard to hear on any equipment.
     A second gimmick is to record a message on one stereo track
only. Records and tapes have two independent recordings, of
course, normally played simultaneously for stereo effect. On a
record, each stereo track occupies on one side of the V-shaped
groove for the needle. On a tape, the tracks are recorded in
parallel lanes of the magnetic material. The two tracks are called
""right"" and ""left"" after the stereo speakers they will play on.
Otherwise, the tracks are interchangeable -- the sound mixer can
put anything he or she wants on each track. A message on one track
can be masked by simultaneous loud music or lyrics on the opposite
track. With normal stereo balance (or mono equipment) the loud
track drowns out the message track. At home, single-track messages
can be recovered by adjusting the stereo balance so that only the
desired track plays. Sometimes this trick also makes indistinct
words clearer. Even if the words are not exclusively on one track,
they may happen to be more audible on one track.
     A message could be recorded at a speed different from the
rest of the record. Then the record would have to be played faster
or slower than usual to recover the message. Unless the message
was at one of the standard speeds (say, 45 rpm on a 33 1/3 rpm
record), it could not be played normally on home equipment.
     The fourth and most commonly alleged trick is to record a
verbal message backward. Reversed speech has several unexpected
features. One is that syllables are not a constant in the reversal
process. A one-syllable word can have two or three syllables when
played backward. Thus ""number nine"" in the Beatles' REVOLUTION 9
reverses to ""Turn me on, dead man"" (or something like it), a jump
from three to five syllables.
     There is no simple way to predict what a word or phrase will
sound like reversed. Obviously, you can't just reverse the
letters.
     Reversed messages are difficult to recover at home. Record
turntables are not built to go backwards. Some have a neutral
setting, in which the pickup and amplifier remain active and you
can turn the record backward by hand. But hardly anyone has a
stead enough hand to produce satisfactory results.
     With patience, it is possible to reverse a cassette
recording. Transfer the music from the original record or tape
onto a blank tape cassette. Place the cassette flat on a table.
Draw our the part of the tape with the suspected message and snip
it off at both ends. Hold the tape segment horizontally. Rotate it
180 degrees, keep it horizontal at all times. This turns the tape
end for end. Splice the reversed tape segment back onto the two
loose ends of the cassette with strong adhesive tape. Reel the
tape back inside the cassette. The sliced segment will play
backward on an ordinary cassette player.
     I rented a recording studio to test the secret-message
rumors. New copiies of the records in question were transcribed on
a quarter-inch master tape. Where rumor alleged that a single
stereo track contained a message, right and left stereo tracks
were transcribed separately. Records with alleged inaudible
messages were treated similarly. To test claims of reversed
messages, recordings on the master tape were edited out and
spliced in backward. Twenty cuts or portions of cuts from sixteen
albums were tested.


""Another One Bites the Dust""
Queen, THE GAME

Rumor: When played backward, the lyrics say, ""It's fun to smoke
marijuana.""
Findings: There is something that sounds like ""It's fun to smoke
marijuana"" in the reversed music. It is repeated over and over. It
might be rendered no less faithfully, however, as ""sfun to scout
mare wanna."" This ""message"" is the reversal of the song title,
which is repeated as a line in the song.
     Let's make a distinction between engineered and phonetic
reversals. When an artist records a verbal statement, reverses it
by turning the tape end for end, mixes the reversed statement onto
a master tape, and has records and tapes produced from the master,
that is an engineered reversal. When the phonetic properties of
song lyrics are such that they can be reversed to sound like
something else, that is a phonetic reversal.
     ""It's fun to smoke marijuna"" is clearly a phonetic reversal.
The lyrics are perfectly plain played forward (""Another one bites
the dust""), no so plain played backward (""sfun to scout mare
wanna""). With an engineered reversal, the opposite should hold
true: gibberish forward, clear as a bell backward. Some are
prepared to believe that phonetic reversals are just as
intentional as engineered reversals -- that the songwriter
painstakinginly planned the phonetic double-entendre. In the
absence of confirming evidence, that just doesn't wash. It's too
easy to find coincidences. If, for example, the letters of the
alphabet are recited in conventional fashion (Ay, Bee, Cee, etc.)
and reversed, at least five sound like English language words. D
reverses to ""eden,"" F becomes ""pray,"" S becomes ""say,"" V becomes
""even,"" and Z becomes ""easy."" ""It's fun to smoke marijuana"" is
likewise a coincidence.


""A Child is Coming""
Jefferson Starship, BLOWS AGAINST THE EMPIRE

Rumor: When played backward, ""son of Satan.""
Findings: Another phonetic coincidence. The repeated ""It's getting
better"" reverses to an iffy ""son of Satan,"" the ""of"" drawn out and
the ""Satan"" strongly accented on the first syllable.


""Eldorado""
Electric Light Orchestra, ELDORADO

Rumor: When played backward, ""He is the nasty one/ Christ, you're
infernal/ It is said we're dead men/ Everyone who has the mark
will live.""
Findings: Coincidence. The supposed message lurks around the line
""On a voyage of no return to see."" Reversed, this passage becomes
the expected syllable salad -- no one hearing it would describe it
as anything but reversed music. Only if you listen while reading
along with what you're supposed to hear will you get anything. The
rumored version of the message is somewhat fudged. The passage
sounds more like ""He's to nasty one/ Christ you are, Christ,
you're fernal/ There wiss uh, we're dead men..."" There is no ""in""
in what is taken to be ""infernal."" The line that is supposed to be
""Everyone who has the mark will live"" isn't even close, though the
syllable count is right.


""Shoo Be Doo""
The Cars, CANDY-O

Rumor: When played backward, the word ""Satan"" repeated
approximately eleven times.
Findings: Coincidence. The rumor refers to the reversal of the ""Shoo
be doo, shoo be doo, shoo be doo..."" near the end of the song. Given
the mysterious logic of reversed phonemes, these three-syllable units
can be hard as a repeated two-syllable word. The word sounds a little
like ""Satan.""


""Snowblind""
Styx, PARADISE THEATER

Rumor: According to a mimeographed list of suspect records distributed
by Congressman Dornan, the words ""Satan move through our voices"" when
played backwards.
Findings: Negative. Despite repeated listenings, it was not even
possible to identify the part of the reversed track that Dornan et al.
are talking about.


""Stairway to Heaven""
Led Zeppelin, untitled, a.k.a. STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN

Rumor: In reverse, ""I live for Satan... The Lord turns me off...
There's no escaping it... Here's to my sweet Satan... There's power in
Satan... He will give you 666.""
Findings: Coincidence. If you listen very carefully to the ""And it
makes me wonder"" lines in reverse, you'll hear something approaching
""There's no escaping it."" A better description is ""There's no escape
do."" Knock of the last syllable, and you have ""There's no escape,"" a
complete, intelligible sentence in reverse. It's there, all right, but
it's not an unlikely enough coincidence to -- well, make you wonder.
      The ""Satan"" in ""I live for Satan"" is good and clear. The ""I live
for"" part isn't. The other alleged lines are unremarkable. All are
phonetic reversals of the entirely lucid forward lyrics and obviously
just accidents.


""When Electricity Came to Arkansas""
Black Oak Arkansas, BLACK OAK ARKANSAS and RONCH AND ROLL

Rumor: In reverse, ""Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan. He is God. He
is God.""
Findings: The BLACK OAK ARKANSAS cut was reversed. Again, pairs of
reversed syllables are being freely interpreted as ""Satan."" ""He is
God"" was not identifiable.


""Rain""
The Beatles, HEY JUDE

Rumor: Unintelligible lyrics at the end are reversed.
Findings: A true engineered reversal and not really a secret. ""Rain""
seems to have been the first popular recording to incorporate an
obviously reversed lyric. The story is that John Lennon accidentally
spliced the last part of the song in backward and liked the effect.
When reversed, the strange-sounding vocals at the end become
intelligible as a reprise starting with the drawn-out word
""sunshine.""
      The reversal is less apparent to the casual listener than it
might be because the accompanying music is not reversed. The ending
fits in smoothly with the rest of the song, the vocals suggesting a
foreign language.


""Fire on High""
Electric Light Orchestra, FACE THE MUSIC

Rumor: When played backward, ""The music is reversible, but time --
turn back!""
Findings: ""Fire on High"" is instrumental. About twenty-six seconds
into the music, scrambled speech is heard. It is mostly louder than
the accompanying music and begins with a two-syllable unit repeated
several times. The seeming speech lasts for about fourteen seconds.
      Reversing the music confirms that there is a true, engineered
message. In reverse, a voice (Jeff Lynne's?) says, ""The music is
reversible, but time -- turn back! Turn back! Turn back! Turn back!""
All the words are clear and unambiguous. Anyone comparing this to the
alleged reversal on ELO's ""Eldorado"" will have no trouble telling
which is genuine.


""Goodbye Blue Sky""
Pink Floyd, THE WALL

Rumor: In reverse, ""You have discovered the secret message.""
Findings: The ""secret message"" is at the very end of the instrumental
passage following the ""Goodbye Blue Sky"" vocals. It comes just before
the words ""What shall we do"" at the start of the song that is
identified as ""Empty Spaces"" on the record label and as ""What shall we
do now?"" on the record sleeve. Played forward, the message is less
apparent than the FACE THE MUSIC reversal: A reasonably attentive
listener might play THE WALL through and not catch it. It suggests
speech not quite close enough to be overheard. In context this is not
unusual because the ""Goodbye Blue Sky"" instrumental passage includes
""airport noises"" and other sound effects. A loud climax in the music
further masks the unintelligible voice.
      When played backward, the voice (Roger Waters?) plainly intones,
""Congratulations, you have just discovered the secret message. Please
send your answer to old Pink, care of the funny farm..."" As the voice
fades out, there may be another word -- perhaps ""Chalfonte or
""Chelsea"" -- after ""funny farm.""


""Heavy Metal Poisoning""
Styx, KILROY WAS HERE

Rumor: A red sticker on the KILROY WAS HERE cover warns, ""By order of
the Majority for Musical Morality, this album contains secret backward
messages...""
Findings: This is a case of second-generation backward-masking. Styx'
PARADISE THEATER did not contain a backward message, though a lot of
people said it did. So Styx has included a sure enough backward
message on KILROY WAS HERE. It is at the very beginning of ""Heavy
Metal Poisoning."" The reversed speech last about three seconds. There
is no musical background. The words reverse to ""Annuit coeptis. Novus
ordo seclorum."" This is the Latin motto encircling the pyramid on the
back of a dollar bill. The usual translation: ""God has favored our
undertakings. A new order of the ages.""
      The cover sticker's ""Majority for Musical Morality"" is a
fictitious Falwellesque group in the KILROY WAS HERE video. Although
the sticker suggests a plurality of ""messages,"" only one was found.


Space between ""I'm So Tired"" and ""Blackbird""
The Beatles, untitled, a.k.a. THE WHITE ALBUM

Rumor: A reversed message. At the time of the Paul-is-dead stories,
the segue from ""I'm So Tired"" to ""Blackbird"" was offered as evidence.
It was held to contain John Lennon's voice, reveresed, saying ""Paul is
dead, miss him, miss him, miss him."" That interpretation seems
unlikely now, but there is a mysterious low muttering between the
songs.
Findings: The mumbling is actually just to the ""I'm So Tired"" side of
the shiny ""space"" between cuts on the record. Each of the stereo
tracks was recorded separately, twice, and a copy of each track was
reversed. This produced four versions of the two-second passage: right
forward, left forward, right reversed, and left reversed. All were
equally unintelligible. It was not even apparent whether the voice is
forward or reversed. Nor could John Lennon be identified as the
speaker. There are nine or ten syllables. The first six (when played
forward) are a two-syllable unit repeated three times. There is little
or no difference betwen the stereo tracks. Any claimed interpretation
of the sounds seems doubtful.


""Strawberry Fields Forever""
The Beatles, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR

Rumor: It was, of course, claimed that John Lennon says ""I buried
Paul"" at the end. (It's forward, at the very end after the music
fades to complete silence, returns, and starts to fade out again.)
But Lennon told ROLLING STONE that the words are ""cranberry
sauce.""
Findings: They are ""cranberry sauce."" The ""sauce""/""Paul"" part is
indistinct, but the first syllable sounds a lot more like ""cran""
than ""I.""


""Baby You're a Rich Man""
The Beatles, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR

Rumor: On one of the tracks the line ""Baby you're a rich man too""
is sung as ""Baby you're a rich fag Jew,"" a dig at Brian Epstein.
Or some think it's ""rich fat Jew"" and claim it as evidence of
Beatle anti-Semitism.
Findings: Negative. The two stereo tracks are nearly identical.
It's always possible to hear words as similar-sounding words, but
basically, the lyrics jibe with the published version.


""Revolution 9""
The Beatles, untitled, a.k.a. THE WHITE ALBUM

Rumor: Various reversed and/or one-track speech. The reversal of
""Number nine"" to ""Turn me on, dead man"" has pretty much been
discounted as coincidence (though it appears on Congressman
Dornan's list).
Findings: Distinction between lyrics and any hidden message blurs
on ""Revolution 9."" The eight-minute cut is a montage of sounds
collected by John Lennon and Yoko Ono. It includes discordant
music, radio broadcasts, sirens, applause, gunfights, sports
cheers, the crackling of a fire, screams, a baby gurgling, a choir
singing, and much that cannot be identified. For this
investigation, ""Revolution 9"" was transcribed four times, twice on
each stereo channel. One copy of each of the tracks was reversed.
The four resulting versions were compared with each other and
against the original two-channel version.
     ""Revolution 9"" contains a lot of talking. Played in stereo,
forward, the longest stretch of understandable speech is probably
an announcer saying, ""...every one of them knew that as time went
by they'd get a little bit older and a little bit slower...""
     One believable instance of reversed speech occurs: someone
saying ""Let me out! Let me out!"" (once held to represent McCartney
in his totaled Aston-Martin). Two iffy reversals occur on the
backward recording of the right stereo track:""She used to be
assistant"" and ""There were two men..."" Neither is clear enough or
long enough to be convincing. Some of the music, including the
recurring theme, sounds more natural in reverse.
     ""Turn me on, dead man"" is a typical phonetic reversal. The
forward ""number nine"" (repeated throughout the cut) is clear; the
reversal is slurred -- something like ""turn me on dedmun."" It has
been claimed that ""number nine"" must be pronounced with a British
accent or with some careful inflection in order to reverse to
""Turn me on, dead man."" This seems not to be so. As an experiment,
three American-accent renderings of ""number nine"" were reversed.
All sound about as much like ""Turn me on, dead man"" as the record
did. Like the other phonetic reversals, ""Turn me on, dead man""
must be considered a coincidence.
     Much of ""Revolution 9"" is on one stereo track only. Near the
end a voice says ""A fine natural imbalance...the Watusi...the
twist...Eldorado...Eldorado."" ""A fine natural imbalance"" is on the
right track only, though the words that follow are in stereo. One
of the longer bits of speech -- ""Who could tell what he was
saying? His voice was low and his [unintelligible] was high and
his eyes were low"" -- is clear on the left track, a bare whisper
on the right.
     There is a stereophonically concealed ""secret message"" on
""Revolution 9."" The words are on the right track. They begin about
four minutes, fifty-eight seconds into the cut and run for about
twenty-two seconds. They are not likely to be noticed in stereo
because of the much louder left track. The sound of applause
begins on the left track at about five minutes, one second into
the cut. Deafening noises -- the clapping, sirens, music --
continue on the left track until five minutes, forty seconds. It
may or may not have been Lennon's and Ono's intention to conceal
the spoken passage. Given the haphazard quality of ""Revolution 9,""
the concealment may have been accidental. To recover the passage,
the left track must be switched off. The right track can then be
heard to contain a sound like a stopwatch ticking, behind these
words:

     So the wife called, and we better go to see a
     surgeon....[A SCREAM MUFFLES A LINE THAT SOUNDS LIKE
     Well, what with the prices, the prices have snowballed,
     no wonder it's closed.] ...So any and all, we went to
     see the dentist instead, who gave him a pair of teeth,
     which wasn't any good at all. So instead of that he
     joined the bloody navy and went to sea.
                      by William Poundstone
                              1986

     There really are backward messages on rock albums. And the
controversy over ""backward masking"" and ""porn rock"" has inspired a
whole new spate of messages. There may have been more genuine
backward messages in the past few years than ever before.
     The backward message controversy is usually traced to the
1960s and John Lennon's avant-garde sound mixing on such tracks as
""Revolution 9"" on the Beatles' WHITE ALBUM. Lennon probably wasn't
trying to conceal a message so much as create an interesting
sound.
     The matter might have ended right there had it not been for
the Paul McCartney death rumor. College kids tried playing Beatles
records forward, backward, and at various speeds to find ""clues""
to McCartney's fate. In the process they found snippets of speech
from Lennon's experiments. Even after McCartney was found safe and
sound in Scotland, some listeners continued to look for hidden
messages.
     Somehow, fundamentalist Christian groups became convinced
(ca. 1982) that the alleged messages were commercials for devil
worship. Not a single indisputable satanic message has turned up,
but there were scattered attempts to ban or label certain albums.
In 1986 one fundamentalist group announced that the theme song for
the old MR. ED TV show contains the word ""Satan"" when played
backward.)
     Ironically, the publicity accorded nonexistent messages has
inspired several artists -- among them porn rock hearing witness
Frank Zappa -- to hide real background messages in their music.
It's easy to do.
     The performer speaks or sings the message normally, then
reverses the tape, which is mixed into the soundtrack. This is all
accomplished simply enough at any recording studio.
     What's not so simple is playing it back. More home record,
cassette, and compact disk players won't play backward. You can
turn a record backward with a pencil eraser, but it's not good for
the needle or the turntable. The only way to reproduce the message
with full fidelity is to use a professional-quality reel-to-reel
tape player and splice the tape in backward.
     We used the facilities of KLOS radio in Los Angeles to
reverse some recent records containing true backward messages.


""Secret Messages""
Electric Light Orchestra, SECRET MESSAGES

ELO's ELDORADO album was among those alleged to contain satanic
backward masked messages. A patient listening to ELDORADO played
backward reveals no such messages. You hear only what you ought to
hear -- the reversed lyrics of the songs, which sound nothing like
the ""messages"" claimed to be there. In the wake of such
allegations, ELO did put an (innocuous) backward message on their
FACE THE MUSIC album. Perhaps they thought this would show how
silly the allegations were. Instead, the backward-masking people
seized on this as proof that the other ""messages"" were real. In
the latest volley, ELO has named an album after the controversy.
     In Britain (where the backward-masking issue is viewed as an
American eccentricity), the cover of SECRET MESSAGES has a mock
warning label to youth about the hidden label. Word of the albums'
impending release in the United States caused enough of a furor to
chill CBS Records into deleting the cover blurb.
     The reversed message is easy to find. It's at the beginning
of the first song, which is itself called ""Secret Messages."" You
can hear reversed speech when you play the record normally. A
voice intones ""secret messages"" -- forward -- in the middle of the
reversed speech, lest anyone dare be so unhip as to not know
what's going on.
     We transferred a new copy of SECRET MESSAGES to reel-to-reel
tapes and played it backward. The backward message goes: ""WELCOME
TO THE BIG SHOW/ WELCOME TO THE BIG SHOW.""
     That's it.


""Ya Hozna""
Frank Zappa, THEM OR US

""Ya Hozna,"" a six-minute composition on the first record of the
THEM OR US double album, is ENTIRELY backward. The albums' inner
cover, which includes lyrics for the other songs, says, ""backwards
vocal -- you figure it out"" of this cut. It credits Frank and Moon
Zappa, George Duke, and Napoleon Murphy Brock as vocalists.
     Played forward, ""Ya Howza"" sounds like a record played
backward -- reasonably so. The vocals are prominent and
unintelligible. Moon Zappa's voice is curiously recognizable, even
in reverse. It is hard to tell whether the music was recorded
forward or backward.
     When ""Ya Howza"" is played in reverse, you discover that the
music is virtually a palindrome -- it sounds about the same
forward and backward. The voices are all backward. In some cases
they have been modified electronically. Many of the words are
muffled. Even after repeated careful listening on both stereo
tracks, it is difficult to make out many of the lyrics. It doesn't
help that some of the words seem to be stream-of-consciousness
nonsense. Some of the unintelligible stuff sounds like opera.
     Starting at the beginning of the reversed tape -- the end of
the forward tape -- the clearer vocals go like this: ""I am the
heaven, I am the water."" This is in a hymnlike register. ""You are
a lonely little girl./ But your mommy and your daddy hold you."" A
singsong synthesizer voice.
     The most interesting part of the lyrics is an intermittently
orgasmic rap in Moon Zappa's Valley Girl voice. There are three
short monologues:

I'm like green!
I'm like squat!
I'm like soul!
Repeat, like soul!
I'm like pull, push,
Okay, like slow, slow.

You're never too old
Like slow, like slow, like slow
Okay, I like it.


All right, faster, faster,
Go, do it, do it twice,
Yeah, that feels good,
I'm looking great,
Yeah, fer shure!
Like, no way!


""No Anchovies, Please""
J. Geils Band, LOVE STINKS

""No Anchovies, Please"" is a novelty song, really a narration with
sound effects, about a woman who is kidnapped after eating
anchovies. She is taken to a ""foreign-speaking"" country. The sound
effect of the foreign tongue seems reversed. When you do play it
in reverse, it becomes: ""It doesn't take a genius to know the
difference between chicken shit and chicken salad.""


""Darling Nikki""
Prince, PURPLE RAIN

""Darling Nikki,"" cited as porn rock before Congress, is about a
dominatrix in a hotel lobby masturbating with a magazine. In part,
the complaint was that the album cover (flowers, and Prince on a
motorcycle) wasn't explicit enough to warn kids of the suggestive
lyrics. Senator Paula Hawkins apparently was not aware of a
backward message hidden in ""Darling Nikki."" The last thirty-five
seconds of the song is gibberish. The music changes abruptly and
becomes a repeated glottal sound. Then a two-syllable sound is
repeated twice, something like ""heaven, heaven."" Unintelligible
speech follows. At the end is a sound reminiscent of rain or bacon
frying , and wind sounds.
     Played backward, the message becomes:

     Hello, how are you?
     I'm fine 'cause I know that the Lord is coming soon.
     Coming, coming soon.

     It is clearly Prince and the Revolution singing this. The
words are clear but the intonation is funny -- the linger on some
words. Perhaps this is to make the reversed message you hear
playing the record normally a little less conspicuous.
     This is a weird reversal of the supposed secret message
menace. Raunchy forward lyrics conceal a religious secret message.


""Judas Kiss""
Petra, MORE POWER TO YOU

Petra is an obscure group that sings religious songs to a rock
beat. As further proof that things have gone full circle, the
backward-masking controversy prompted Petra to include a wholesome
backward message on their MORE POWER TO YOU album. It is in the
transition between two songs, just before ""Judas Kiss."" Clearly
audible gibberish reverses to this (the husky voice a cross
between George Beverly Shea and Dee Snider): ""What are you looking
for the Devil for, when you ought to be looking for the Lord?""

AFL JoyceM Welcome to the Apple II Music & Sound chat - our discussion will
           be on NoiseTracker - the new FTA music program for the GS.  AFA
           Gene will be our host this evening...Gene, the floor is yours :)

AFA Gene   Hi all... well first I'd like to point out, if y'all aren't aware
           yet, that a spanking new version of NoiseTracker has recently
           been released (9 days ago) and is now available in our New Files
           library. It is version 0.5. I haven't played around with it much
           yet, but it's supposed to fix a lot of the little bugs in 0.3
           (the first version we had online).  NoiseTracker also includes
           the ability to directly import ""modules,"" a term used for a
           certain type of Amiga song file which has become popular among PC
           users using the SoundBlaster sound card.

           Now, via NT, these ""MOD"" files are accessible by the GS. We
           expect to see a lot of activity on this end as far as ports from
           the PC and Amiga go. Note that you should be able to go straight
           to the PC music forum and download any recently uploaded MOD
           songfiles (there was a bug in the first wide release of the PCAO
           software, however, so a bunch of files with dates between around
           March 1991 and September 1991 may not download properly. Note that
           to use these PC MOD files, you'll have to rename the downloaded
           file ""MOD.xxxxxx"" if you want it to show up automatically in NT's
           ""open"" dialog box. (On the PC, all MOD files are named
           ""xxxxxxxx.MOD"" instead.)   Also, if the files are packed with ZIP
           compression, you'll need a program from the Communications Forum
           called AGATE -- it's a terminal program that includes the ability
           to unpack ZIP files.

           Now, I guess the best thing to do would be to talk about our
           favorite songfiles... there have been a few complaints, in fact,
           that people were not being ""descriptive"" enough in their file
           descriptions for uploads in describing the songs.

AFC Eddie  ?

AFA Gene   GA ed

AFC Eddie  Once a MOD file is unpacked with Agate, is a file type change
           needed?

AFA Gene   Nope, since all that NT looks for is the ""MOD."" being the first
           four characters in the filename.

AFC Eddie  OK, Thanks!

Deanna7332 Question...

JonL7      Can you list some of the features of Noisetracker?

AFA Gene   (you don't even need that ""MOD."" if you want to type the name in
           directly.)

Deanna7332 Did any of these mod files have anything to do with FTA's ""Module
           A""

AFA Gene   Sure Jon, right after we answer Deanna's question. Deanna, you
           mean ""Modulae?""

Deanna7332 Yes, that's it.

AFA Gene   Modulae was a demo written by FTA last year. (i'll get to you in a
           sec Doors).  It used SoundSmith v0.95 for all it's music. There
           is no connection between MOD files and Modulae by FTA.

Deanna7332 Throughout the demo it said ""Loading modules""

AFA Gene   Those ""modules"" are not the same as Amiga soundfile ""modules"" --
           you see, what Modulae really was was a ""stringing together"" of a
           bunch of neat little tiny demos that FTA had written. So they
           called each little demo a ""module"" and thus the entire demo as a
           whole, ""Modulae"" (fancy plural of module?)

Deanna7332 Ok I understand.  Thank you. :)

AFL JoyceM Latin, Gene :)

AFA Gene   The term ""MODule"" from the Amiga comes from the idea that all the
           stuff needed to play the songfile (all the instruments + the
           sequence file) are included into one file, the ""module.""

TheDoors1  Gene, I have tried to d/l some recent uploaded MODs in the PC
           music area and still the problem exists.

AFA Gene   As I understand it, the problem was fixed VERY recently (correct
           me on this Joyce) and files uploaded as recently as early
           November still might not work depending on the version of the
           PCAO software that the uploader used.

AFL JoyceM Actually, Gene...I was under the impression that it had been, but
           if Doors is still having a problem, then it must not be fixed.

AFA Gene   What date was the file you tried to d/l, Door?

TheDoors1  umm 11/17, around there

AFA Gene   hmmm.... well i can tell you one thing... if it didn't work, don't
           waste your time again later... the problem is in the Apple
           software's method of d/lling files, and there are no plans to
           upgrade the Apple AO software.

AFL JoyceM I will endeavor to get an answer to that PC downloading
           problem/question :)

ThomasK63  i have a quick question... what can you use to unpack amiga mod
           files? On the PC side, that is.

TheDoors1  Agate Thomas

ELECTMUSIC Doors... what happens on after downloading..

Deanna7332 If it's LZHed you can't unless you have an IBM or
           PC/Transporter.

AFA Gene   If GS-ShrinkIt doesn't have that ability, i don't think there
           exists any such utility on the GS.

TheDoors1  What do you mean Elect?

ELECTMUSIC After you download the file... where do you encounter a problem?

TheDoors1  ok, you know when you download the file and at some point in the
           download the file starts to appear on your screen.  That's when I
           cancel it.

ThomasK63  I am sure soething good can be made w/out resorting to Amiga
           files

AFC Eddie  Yes, Doors, I believe the problem is with the PC software it was
           UL'd with.

TheDoors1  yeah Eddie.

GNO Tim    Amiga MOD files are typically compressed using LHarc.  I've
           uncompressed several on my Unix machine at school.

ThomasK63  good time for someone to make a lharc unpacker...

AFC DYAJim someone might be ;)

GNO Tim    Several people are already

AFC Eddie  Can't wait, Jim!

AFA Gene   Jon, did you have a question?

JonL7      The features of Noisetracker :)

AFA Gene   Oh yes... okay, here goes, in a nutshell, from most important to
           least:


AFA Gene   *  ability to import MOD files

           *  ability to import Soundsmith files

           *  ProDOS 8 based

           *  virtually no editing abilities (not a feature but important to
           know)

AFC DYAJim :)

AFA Gene   *  forgot: and the most important feature of all, the ability to
           hold instrument files in regular system RAM instead of DOC RAM,
           allowing for instruments far beyond the regular 64K limit found
           in ALL other GS music programs.

ThomasK63  I'll buy that!

TheDoors1  I have another question...when you're ready.

AFA Gene   GA Doors

TheDoors1  ok..is it true that NoiseTracker will take in soundsmith files and
           play them more clearly

AFA Gene   Well, as far as ""what you hear,"" yes there is a definite
           difference with some instruments. It does NOT play the sounds
           more ""clearly,"" but it just plays them in a different way. What
           many people seem to like about this ""different way"" is that
           sustained instruments (i.e. instruments designed to be played
           in a loop to simulate a long held note) seem to work better (or
           perhaps simply the way they were originally intended to work).

TheDoors1  I see

Deanna7332 Which takes up more space - MOD or NT  w/soundfile ?

AFA Gene   Deanna, it depends a few things, such as how big the sequence is,
           how many instruments you have, etc. Once you have a lot of
           assorted files, it'll probably average out to be about the same
           give or take a hundred blocks on your HD. So it basically depends
           on whether you prefer to have your instruments separate or not.

Deanna7332 Does playing quality differ with either one ?

AFA Gene   Nope. It's exactly the same either way. Loading time is the same
           too.

AFC Eddie  Can NT save songs as MOD files?

AFA Gene   Nope. It has options for Open and Close module, but these are
           still inactive.

AFA Gene   If there are no more questions, I'd like to talk about which NT
           files out there are the ""hottest,"" since this info could be
           useful to many users who are interested in downloading NT/MOD
           files.

           My personal favorite is ""Lambada,"" which is supplied by FTA with
           the program but is available separately on America
           Online.Everything about this file is really impressive except
           perhaps the sound quality of the horn-ish melody instrument.

           What about y'all, what are your favorite NT files?

AFL JoyceM Gene, there is a classical song for NT, but can't remember the
           name, but it is good.

AFC Eddie  I like Dragnet!

ELECTMUSIC So do I Ed

TheDoors1  I like Seven something

Deanna7332 My most favorite of all mod files is Pleasure Principle

AFC Eddie  <--appreciate's Greg's taste!

AFL JoyceM :)

AFA Gene   Deanna, i assume you got that from a local board?

Deanna7332 I got it from the PC forum here.

TheDoors1  I saw it there also

Deanna7332 I think under ""Pleasure""

AFA Gene   Would you be able to upload it here? If it's really that good, we
           ought to have it available directly in our oun NT lib here (BTW
           folks, we will be releasing a new NoiseTracker software library
           soon!)

AFC Eddie  What a Forum!!!

Deanna7332 That sounds great!

AFL JoyceM Gene, do you think it will be possible for synthLAB files to be
           converted to MOD files?

AFL JoyceM MOD files?

AFA Gene   I doubt it, Joyce. The formats are so diametrically opposed in
           their entire basis of their file formats that it wouldn't be
           worth the time for a programmer to develop such a convertor.

Deanna7332 Isn't it possible to move the mod file from the PC forum to our
           music library?

AFA Gene   But..... it might be worth the time for a MIDI File Format to MOD
           convertor, since these two formats are more widely accepted.

Nuzz       they have nothing better to do Gene

ELECTMUSIC Gene.. some interesting similarities with DTune and NTracker

AFA Gene   They lose the file, tho, Deanna. :)

AFL JoyceM In what way, Greg?

ELECTMUSIC Both Prodos 8

Deanna7332 Shhh they won't know a thing :)

ELECTMUSIC I also believe Bill uses a shuttling of sound data between Doc
           Ram and Ram.

AFC Eddie  Interesting, Greg.

ELECTMUSIC Thats how he gets some of the excellent instrument quality

AFC Eddie  But Diversitune has that one distinction:  MIDI input.

AFL JoyceM Deanna, we would greatly appreciate it if you would upload that
           'Pleasure' song to our library :)

ELECTMUSIC Agreed Ed.. one of the factors FTA doesn't like to incorporate
           into their programs.

Deanna7332 I'll u/l it tonight if possible.

AFL JoyceM Thanks :)

AFC Eddie  Thanks, Deanna!

AFL JoyceM I will send Bill B a copy of NoiseTracker + some MOD files...to
           see what comments we get from him (will send when I get back).

AFC DYAJim What ever happened to that diversitune upgrade that was talked
           about ?

ELECTMUSIC That would be interesting Joyce

AFC Eddie  Bill apparently still working on it, Jim.

ELECTMUSIC I am sure he would appreciate the Prodos 8

AFC DYAJim good..

AFL JoyceM Jim...RSN....he was hoping by Christmas (this year), but he is
           soooo busy with his job, who knows?

AFC DYAJim Oh yeah, I noticed the speed calcuation in NT .5 is inaccurate
           :)

AFC DYAJim I recall he has set a lot of Christmas projected dates :)

ELECTMUSIC He was one of the first ""Free Tools"" experts in breaking all the
           rules for economic sake.

AFC DYAJim like for the vaporware DT inst editor like 2 years ago.

Deanna7332 Are there any Christmas Mod or NT songs?

AFC Eddie  Oh yeah, Diversi-Editor!

AFL JoyceM I know, Jim - but that I know he has been working on.

AFC DYAJim he projected Christmas for it, and it never came :)

AFA Gene   Not yet in AMS, but hopefully the Holiday Contest will change all
           that. :)

AFC DYAJim I look foreward to any upgrades..

AFL JoyceM Not that I am aware of Deanna - you have some?  hint, hint

Deanna7332 Nope sorry.  I was hoping there were some that could be u/led
           here

AFC DYAJim I'll be breaking out the xmas tune book rsn.. I should be able to
           midi a few :) (which rules out nt)

AFL JoyceM Question...

AFC Eddie  It would be more appropriate to have a converter from Appleworks
           spreadsheet to MOD than from MIDI!

AFL JoyceM If I got ahold of an Amiga song (MOD) disk...how would I convert
           them for here?

AFA Gene   You mean an Amiga-formatted disk?

AFL JoyceM Yes

AFC DYAJim Ack.. methinks you need an amiga and a null modem cable or a
           modem.

AFA Gene   Methinks Jim is right

AFC DYAJim LOL!!  Design your music in the spreadsheet then import to NT :)
           IT might actually have better editing?!! :)

AFC Eddie  Right!

AFL JoyceM Me thinks he is right.  If I had them upload to me, would that
           work?

AFA Gene   Yep; should work like a charm.

AFC DYAJim Yah.. as long as they're coming from an amiga

AFL JoyceM Great....I will work on that when I get back  (making note now).

AFL JoyceM Gene, will you get some of those files (NT) sent to that area
           tonight?  If so, I will leave the needed message :)

AFA Gene   That's all I have planned for tonight's chat, Joyce. Yep, I'll
           move some files right now.

AFL JoyceM Thanks...

AFL JoyceM Then we should have our NoiseTracker Library by end of the week in
           AMS :)

ELECTMUSIC Gene... quick question:  Are you launching NTracker from a 3.5
           disk?

AFL JoyceM Okay, guys...I will see you all the week of December 11th (may the
           4th) as I am off on vacation.

AFA Gene   Yep greg

AFC JohnC  Where are you going?

ELECTMUSIC Do you encounter out of memory problems

AFL JoyceM Night all...and Gene, thanks for an excellent chat and great
           explanations of NoiseTracker.

Nuzz       Joyce, I have good news for FutureSound owners. SoundConvert will
           support it in the first release

AFC Eddie  Great, Mike!

AFA Gene   Greg, i always keep my RAMdisk at 0 when using noisetracker. Not
           only are

AFC JohnC  Mike...SoundConvert...released?

AFL JoyceM Great, Mike.  When can we get SoundConvert, Mike? and FutureSound
           :)

AFA Gene   there a couple of bugs with memory management, but if you're
           loading in a MOD file that's really big, NT will eat your RAMdisk.

AFC Eddie  Sounds good.

Nuzz       The manual is being ""layout"". Release date should be about 1st
           week of Dec

ELECTMUSIC Tnxs Gene

AFC JohnC  YES.......WTG Nuzz!!!!!!!!

Deanna7332 Yes, why is there on some MOD files a stop somewhere in the middle
           ?

Deanna7332 That's really frustrating!

AFL JoyceM Mike, leave me E-Mail on when and how I can send your the $$ to
           get it.

AFL JoyceM Again...night all

Nuzz       gee John, I had to do something to explain the delay :)

ELECTMUSIC Thanks Gene for a GREAT chat!

AFC Eddie  Yes, Gene!  Great!

AFA Gene   Thanks Greg, 'night!

AFA Gene   thanx, see y'all later :)

   And became the Aten King, first one!                    

   Duchess Malinda, who doesn't do windas,
   But she does a lot of Duchess Things,
   But give her a LOT of Imperium Compound,
   And she sings and sings and sings and sings and sings!   

   Duke Sir Brion, with his pretty white suit on,
   Is a model of goodness and purity
   Never touches Imperium Compound
(spoken:) And I'll sell ya seashore property in Yuma, too!  

   Optional last verse:

   Many tales abound of Imperium Compound
   And its' strange effects on Royalty,
   But after an hour, this song has no power,
   And by now, it's boring ME!                            

   AltChorus: Oh it's too long, too long, too long
              To sing the whole song, the song, the song
              Longer than a Royal Court, it is!
              But sing it serial, this ditty Imperial
              And you'll be a bardic whiz!

        Last night I had the strangest dream in this bleak century
        I dreamed that people the world around believed in Chivalry

        I dreamed I saw a Kingly Crown enshrined in laurel leaves
        with Grace and Joy and Purity attendant at his feet

        I dreamed I saw the perfect Knight receive his accolade
        and minstrels sang and children laughed in some soft forest glade

        I dreamed I saw the finest thing that ever man could make
        grow great and strong and undefiled: Pray God I never wake!

        Last night I had the strangest dream in this bleak century
        I dreamed that people the world around believed in Chivalry

               (to the tune of ""Good King Wenceslaus"")

                Locksley Monsters never yield
                on the field of battle
                strike the helm and bash the shield
                make their eyeteeth rattle
                Bodies on the ground will lie
                bones will burst in sunder
                search for Locksleys' enemies:
                You'll find them six feet under!

                              SONG OF IVANOF

            There is a man who we know well that does the best he can
            but he's displayed in armour made of reticulated garbage cans!

            He looks so fine and fair and strong, oh how he plays the man
            and how it's prized, those galvanized, reticulated garbage cans

            The noblest Roman of them all, a good Praetorian
            a combatant who wears no pants, judst reticulated garbage cans!

            Like old Horatius at the Bridge, like the Legions of Valerian
            (O dearie me: those LOVELY knees!)
            and those reticulated garbage cans!

                         C. McCray Bethancourt

         (sung to the tune (obviously) of the 12 Days of Christmas)


1.           The first time I sent my device, The Heralds said to me

            ""It violates the Rule of Three""

2.           The next time I tried it, the Heralds said to me

            ""We changed the forms, and it violates the Rule of
             Three"".

3.           The third time I tried, and the Heralds said to me, 

            ""We upped the fees, we changed the forms, and it
             violates the Rule of Three"".

4.           Another time I tried and the Heralds said to me,
 
            ""We haven't got it, we upped the fees, we changed the 
             forms, and it violates the Rule of Three"".

5.           The fifth time I tried it, the Heralds said to me,  

            ""In a decision rendered by the College of Arms on
             August 1st, A.S. V it was decided that this style of
             heraldic design was not appropriate to the aims and 
             intentions of the Corporate Body. Holy! Holy! Holy! ""

 note: verse 5 is delivered in an extremely fast, mono-
       tone, similiar to a Gregorian Chant.

           "" ....we haven't got it, we upped the fees, we changed the forms,
             and it violates the Rule of Three.""

6.           I tried it a sixth time, and the Heralds said to me,

            ""We changed the rules, &c""

7.           A seventh time I tried and, the Heralds said to me,

            ""It's against the Rule of Tincture, we changed the
             rules, &c""

8.           I tried it once again and the heralds said to me,

            ""It's not a Period design, It's against the Rule of Tincture, We
             changed the rules, &c""

                                * more *



    Heralds Said To Me (cont.)

9.           I sent it in once more, and the Heralds said to me,

            ""We changed the rules again, It's not a Period design,
             it's against the Rule of Tincture, we changed the
             rules, &c""

10. (sung in cold anger)
             The LAST time I sent my device, the Heralds said to me

    (sung in a state of SMUG)
             ""Someone else has got it, &c""




              (nb: every single one of these reasons has been used by the
              CoA, at one point or another, to reject perfectly good
              heraldry, along with some even MORE stupid.  If the shoe 
              fits....................!!!!!!!!)

                        Tune: Waltzing Matilda
 
           or: Who was that Vermin I saw you with last, Knight?
   or: There may be Lice on all you Knice, but there ain't no Lice on me

           Once there was a Barony howling in the wilderness
           nestled in the Valley where the River doesn't flow
           and the folks were driven buggy by the insects in the Revel Hall
           Authenticity is wonderful, but this doesn't go!

                   Bugs on the Baroness, bugs on the Baroness!
                   That was the cry that you heard all the day
                   and the scratching can be heard from Ysgithr to Ered Sul
                   why did we come here? Let's go away!

           See them all a scratching, nestled in their armour tight
           the fleas have a melee team that's challenging the field!
           call Truly Nolen! Someone's gotta help us out!
           the crabs are nesting in our helms but we'll never yield!

                   (chorus)

           Dawn comes a-breaking, the bugs have won the Coronet...
           flea-infested Conan-clones in piles upon the lawn
           where is the Barony? The bugs have eaten everyone...
           termites got the stick-jocks, and all their sticks are gone!

                   (chorus)

                          ATENVELDT
                          tune: The West's Awake

                  For all the Lands where I have dwelt
                  Oh Atenveldt, Oh Atenveldt
                  till rivers burn and mountains melt
                  lest I forget my Atenveldt
                  From deserts stark to snow-capped peaks
                  from silent lakes and laughing creeks
                  sing: Oh let man find his heart's ease
                  on rocky plains
                  in desert breeze

                  For oft I thought of mighty men
                  who carved a Land with sword and pen
                  and lit a candle, burning bright,
                  that pierced the darkness; stirred the night!
                  tho some are gone their deeds remain
                  this sunny Crown without a stain
                  sing: Oh, their deeds were not in vain!
                  in sunlit days
                  and falling rain.....

                  So raise your banners, blazoned bright
                  Advance the Dream and Shine the Light!
                  in battle's crash and Revel's song
                  raise high the Flag and wave it long!
                  For all the Lands wherein I've dwelt
                  I love you best, my Atenveldt!
                  Sing: Oh the Joy that I have felt!
                  My Atenveldt
                  My Atenveldt

      What the use of wearing panties
      whalebone corsets of your Auntie's
      boxer shorts and other scanties
      best of all is nude
      there's such fun in going bra-less
      now that it's no longer lawless
      'specially if your figure's flawless
      best of all is nude
      nude is what you're born in
      shirts are never torn in
      underwear and lacy flimsies, garter belts and other whimsies
      yards of itchy cloth to put your form in
      ducks all do it, maidens rue it
      even ancient Picts in Britain blue it
      going naked's how to do it
      best of all is nude!

      If your garters aren't elastic
      tie them up in knots fantastic
      (panty hose is something drastic!)
      best of all is nude!
      If you're tired of wearing clotheses
      shed your garment 'mongst the roses
      never mind the old bluenoses
      best of all is nude!
      Nude is best for ducking!
      Worst for horses bucking!
      Moonlit nights will see such sights
          that are very best for fooling round
                              .....and elbows!
      Nudity is grand to see
       a well-known antidote to virginity
      take your clothes off and you'll see:
      best of all is nude!

                   Hi said the Norn, sittin in the sand
                   once I talked to a great Grey Man
                   spun three times and said with a sigh
                   hadn't been for the Runes had his other eye!

                   prettiest thing I've ever seen
                   she went down underneath the hill
                   and came back out of her own free will

                   Brian Boru, on Irish ground
                   walked three times the Island round
                   Norsemen came lookin for a fight
                   just another Irish Saturday night!

                   Hi said Lugh on the banquest night

                   a harper and a warrior and none the least:
                   a Druid and he got in to the Feast!

                   Harold Haardrada's face was red!
                   Came to Britain and he wound up dead
                   Stamford Bridge is where he's found
                   got six feet of English ground

                   the Legion with it's Eagles bright
                   marched into the Pictish night
                   met them there upon the sand
                   gave em up to the Wicker Man!

                   eight-legged steed and hound of Hel
                   the one-eyed Man, he loves ya well
                   fire burn and fire spark
                   are you then feared of the dark?

                   The Circle forms, the Circle flows
                   the Circle goes where no man knows
                   Hail to the Lady, one in three:
                   Present is Past and Past is Me!

                   Rhiannon's Birds are still in flight

                                  spread their seeds thruout the Land

                                  by the fire burning bright
                                  came to know his heart's delight!

        Away out here they have a name for even the Ump that's Wuggly
        But the last word in Awfulness, M'Lady, you're The Ugly!

                M'Lady, M'Lady, they call the pigs M'Lady!

        Before I knew M'Lady's name and heard her constant whinin'
        I thought all girls were beautiful and the sun was always shinin'

        Then one day, M'Lady came, and stopped the clocks from tickin'
        she curdled milk, aborted cows, and stopped my stamps from stickin'!

                (chorus)

        Away out here they have a name for everything worth seein'
        but if M'Lady looks at you, then soon you will be fleein'

        M'Lady disappeared one day, and that for sure is scary
        she was the result of experiments by a deranged Vetinary!

                    WEAPONS AT THE DOOR

 Being a Polemic concerning the alleged Custom of the West Kingdom concerning 
 checking your Weapons at the Door of the Revel Hall. As the Satire is the 
 Weapon of the Bard, this said Polemic is to be checked at the Door, along with 
 swords, knives, redheaded Ladies and other such Deadly Things.....

         As I roved out to Western Lands to take the Western Air
         I went into a Revel Hall and I saw a Twelfth Night there
         but I was halted at the gate by a Privy Consellor
                 (that's the man who tells the King of the West how to go to
                  the bath room!)
         who told me I would have to check my Weapons at the door

         As I, in my astonishment, stood hung on tenter-pegs
         a Knight came in whose Prouess hung down between his legs
         the Doorman grabbed a greatsword and he struck the Knight full sore
         and gave him a reciept; he left his weapon at the door!

         a Bard was next whose goodly Voice has entertained us all
         but he, too, was prevented from entering the Hall
         and told he could not carry deadly weapons on the floor
         he left his Voice and Harp among the weapons at the door

         a Master entered graciously, a man we all know well
         who holds a 3rd Dan Black Belt, tho this he'd never tell
         the Master struggled valiantly, the Master cursed and swore
         but he left his hands, and feet, as weapons at the door

         the company was jovial, altho a bit dismayed
         for lack of proper cutlery, down to the smallest blade
         for even teeth and fingernails, each can be used in War
         were cut, and pulled, and left behind, as weapons at the door!

         And has their King not loyal Knights that He must be afraid
         of brawling in his Hall and of Assassin's bloody blade?
         the Rights of Men to carry Arms at least WE'VE not foreswore
         and a POX on them that made the Rule of Weapons at the Door!

                           THE STREETS OF ANN ARBOR

               As I walked out thru the streets of Ann Arbor
               as I walked out thru Ann Arbor one day
               I spied a young Mongol all dressed in white linen
               all dressed in white linen and cold as the clay

               I then spied another, done in on the sidewalk
               along with just about six dozen more
               their wounds were all gaping, from mace and from braoadsword
               from claymore and cannon, all dripping with gore

               what caused this grave carnage, I cried to the Monglos
               oh pray what's the reason for this awful sight
               my answer came slowly from under the corpse-pile
               ""It seems that our bark is much worse than our bite.....""

               the answer continued from pale lips a-shaking
               we sang all our songs and believed them as true
               the Dark Horde could never be beaten in battle
               we thought this was what all good Mongols could do...

               we went down to Atenveldt all for to plunder
               ""too large to defend"" was our song every night
               but Atenveldt's different from East, West or Middle
               there, even the bushes have learned how to bite!

               the Clann stole our ponies, the Scraelings our foodstuffs
               we ran into axes in AtenViking hands
               our maidens ran off with one Richard of Arkham
               and we're all that's left to return to our lands

               MacChluarains and Monsters, Lockehaven and Foxmoor
               that Kingdom is BIG and its' fighters are MEAN!
               we fought and we lost, and fled back to Ann Arbor
               we all came back home with results that you've seen

               keep away from that Land with its' cactus and marshes
               it's no place for Mongols who are bent on War
               they count their blows well, but they strick them yet better
               he crawled into his Yurt, and fell, dead, on the floor.....

       tune: the song of the Cowardly Lion, Tin Woodsman and Scarecrow
             in the movie version of the Wizard of Oz

        (Enter the Scarecrow, who singeth:)

        My wife is always nagging; my Prowess it is lagging
        I can't do anything
        she has got a reason, but revenge is out of season
        Oh I wish I could be King!

        If I just had the Crown on, I'd always have a frown on
        and the Barons on a string
        Heads they would be rolling, the Board would be cajoling
        Oh if only I was King!

        I am very fed up with the way this group is set up
        Oh I'd change everything!
        they are so high and mighty with the way that they do fight-ey
        Oh, someday I'll be King!

        Tho my wife is melancholic, and very...vitriolic
        she's a wasp without a sting!
        I'd have to supervise her with a pack of tranquilizers
        If I only was a King......

        (the Tin Woodsman joineth him, and singeth:)

        I grew up kind of cocky, and rather big, and stocky
        and straight as any rod
        on the field I'm a battallion, with the Ladies I'm a stallion
        ...Oh they'd better make me God!

        The other boys are jealous they say I'm over-zealous
        they'd do better to applaud
        the things that I am giving to this Dream that we are living
        oh I wish they'd make me God!

        They say that I'm conceited, but I'm just badly treated
        by people and by BoD
        just think of what they're missing by My Majesty dismissing
        Oh they'd better make me God!

        (the Cowardly Lion creepeth forth, and singeth:)

        Oh I could be a fighter, a great and mighty smiter
        and be the perfect knight
        it's a great and nasty shame, and everyone's to blame
        oh I wish that I could fight!

        Song of the Three (cont.)

        I could be a Cavalier drinking wine and ale and beer
        and be a gorgeous sight
        but it would cost me too much money so it isn't very funny
        oh I wish that I could fight!                               

        Let me at 'em on the field, I would surely make them yield
        to my Power and my Might
        with rattan, shinai and rapier they would nevermore escape here
        If they'd only let me fight

                She was afraid to come out to the Tourney
                She was worried that ""something might show..""
                She was afraid to come out to the Tourney
                And the poor thing did NOT want to go...

                  (2 - 3 - 4, tell the people what she wore!)

                One day in the Kingdom of the Middle
                It happened at a Tourney one day:
                The Mongols invaded the Middle
                But the Middle did not want to play...

                  (eins - zwei - drei, but the Dark Horde wouldn't die!)

          I'd rather sing a song than work (if it's not too phrasey!)

          Yang, your yurt is very nice, and your Horde is smelly,
          And I'm sure that yak-meat will nicely fill one's belly!
          But remember this one line, or you're not worth jelly:
          FIRST you plunder, THEN you burn! That's how to be rakehelly!

          My Lady Lorelei your eyes do drive me to distraction

          And the Ladies, bless 'em all, are most ornamental!
          But that little Nikki-Toad....has me sentimental

          This stupid little song, m'lords, is mostly sung in Latin
          By the Goliards, of course, from vespers clear to matins!
          But I prefer a coarser cloth over silk or satins
          English is more understood, mine enemies to flatten!

          Good People all, I've made my Song, its' music's well-recited
          But my voice could use some work; the flowers it has blighted!
          It's rude and rusty, grim and bad, and squeaky like a door-hinge,
          But I'm a better Bard than you: I found a rhyme for ""orange!""

                      by William Poundstone
                              1983

     Two mentalities are at work here: 1960s rock fans and 1980s
fundamentalist Christians. The idea of phonographically concealed
messages dates from the Paul McCartney death scare of 1969. For
hard-core types, the secret-message rumors never really died. Avid
rock fans have auditioned ever album release since the late 1960s
for hidden nuances. Backward messages, barely audible messages,
and messages on one stereo track only have been alleged. At the
other end of the sociosensual spectrum, fundamentalist Christians
have gotten into the act. TV programs such as PRAISE THE LORD and
THE 700 CLUB have propagated rumors of a satanic plot in the
recording industry, no less, in which various albums conceal
""backward-masked"" demonic murmurings. If THAT sounds too spacey to
be taken seriously, consider that it was the fundamentalist groups
who were behind House Resolution 6363, a bill introduced in the
U.S. House of Representatives by Robert K. Dornan (R., Calif.) in
1982 to label all suspect records: ""WARNING: THIS RECORD CONTAINS
BACKWARD MASKING THAT MAKES A VERBAL STATEMENT WHICH IS AUDIBLE
WHEN THIS RECORD IS PLAYED BACKWARD AND WHICH MAY BE PERCEPTIBLE
AT A SUBLIMINAL LEVEL WHEN THIS RECORD IS PLAYED FORWARD."" In
February 1983, the Arkansas State Senate passed a similar record-
labeling bill by a vote of 86 to 0.
     Contributing to the quasi-occult status of these rumors is
the difficulty of checking them out on home audio equipment. You
pretty much have to take someone else's word for it, or dismiss
the rumors out of hand.
     From a technical standpoint, there are four simple ways to
conceal a verbal message on a recording. The most obvious is to
record the message at a very low volume. The message may then be
recovered by turning the volume up while playing the record or
tape. If the message is faint enough, though, noise levels of home
equipment may garble it. If the accompanying music or lyrics are
loud enough, or if the message itself is indistinct or
electronically modified, it may be hard to hear on any equipment.
     A second gimmick is to record a message on one stereo track
only. Records and tapes have two independent recordings, of
course, normally played simultaneously for stereo effect. On a
record, each stereo track occupies on one side of the V-shaped
groove for the needle. On a tape, the tracks are recorded in
parallel lanes of the magnetic material. The two tracks are called
""right"" and ""left"" after the stereo speakers they will play on.
Otherwise, the tracks are interchangeable -- the sound mixer can
put anything he or she wants on each track. A message on one track
can be masked by simultaneous loud music or lyrics on the opposite
track. With normal stereo balance (or mono equipment) the loud
track drowns out the message track. At home, single-track messages
can be recovered by adjusting the stereo balance so that only the
desired track plays. Sometimes this trick also makes indistinct
words clearer. Even if the words are not exclusively on one track,
they may happen to be more audible on one track.
     A message could be recorded at a speed different from the
rest of the record. Then the record would have to be played faster
or slower than usual to recover the message. Unless the message
was at one of the standard speeds (say, 45 rpm on a 33 1/3 rpm
record), it could not be played normally on home equipment.
     The fourth and most commonly alleged trick is to record a
verbal message backward. Reversed speech has several unexpected
features. One is that syllables are not a constant in the reversal
process. A one-syllable word can have two or three syllables when
played backward. Thus ""number nine"" in the Beatles' REVOLUTION 9
reverses to ""Turn me on, dead man"" (or something like it), a jump
from three to five syllables.
     There is no simple way to predict what a word or phrase will
sound like reversed. Obviously, you can't just reverse the
letters.
     Reversed messages are difficult to recover at home. Record
turntables are not built to go backwards. Some have a neutral
setting, in which the pickup and amplifier remain active and you
can turn the record backward by hand. But hardly anyone has a
stead enough hand to produce satisfactory results.
     With patience, it is possible to reverse a cassette
recording. Transfer the music from the original record or tape
onto a blank tape cassette. Place the cassette flat on a table.
Draw our the part of the tape with the suspected message and snip
it off at both ends. Hold the tape segment horizontally. Rotate it
180 degrees, keep it horizontal at all times. This turns the tape
end for end. Splice the reversed tape segment back onto the two
loose ends of the cassette with strong adhesive tape. Reel the
tape back inside the cassette. The sliced segment will play
backward on an ordinary cassette player.
     I rented a recording studio to test the secret-message
rumors. New copiies of the records in question were transcribed on
a quarter-inch master tape. Where rumor alleged that a single
stereo track contained a message, right and left stereo tracks
were transcribed separately. Records with alleged inaudible
messages were treated similarly. To test claims of reversed
messages, recordings on the master tape were edited out and
spliced in backward. Twenty cuts or portions of cuts from sixteen
albums were tested.


""Another One Bites the Dust""
Queen, THE GAME

Rumor: When played backward, the lyrics say, ""It's fun to smoke
marijuana.""
Findings: There is something that sounds like ""It's fun to smoke
marijuana"" in the reversed music. It is repeated over and over. It
might be rendered no less faithfully, however, as ""sfun to scout
mare wanna."" This ""message"" is the reversal of the song title,
which is repeated as a line in the song.
     Let's make a distinction between engineered and phonetic
reversals. When an artist records a verbal statement, reverses it
by turning the tape end for end, mixes the reversed statement onto
a master tape, and has records and tapes produced from the master,
that is an engineered reversal. When the phonetic properties of
song lyrics are such that they can be reversed to sound like
something else, that is a phonetic reversal.
     ""It's fun to smoke marijuna"" is clearly a phonetic reversal.
The lyrics are perfectly plain played forward (""Another one bites
the dust""), no so plain played backward (""sfun to scout mare
wanna""). With an engineered reversal, the opposite should hold
true: gibberish forward, clear as a bell backward. Some are
prepared to believe that phonetic reversals are just as
intentional as engineered reversals -- that the songwriter
painstakinginly planned the phonetic double-entendre. In the
absence of confirming evidence, that just doesn't wash. It's too
easy to find coincidences. If, for example, the letters of the
alphabet are recited in conventional fashion (Ay, Bee, Cee, etc.)
and reversed, at least five sound like English language words. D
reverses to ""eden,"" F becomes ""pray,"" S becomes ""say,"" V becomes
""even,"" and Z becomes ""easy."" ""It's fun to smoke marijuana"" is
likewise a coincidence.


""A Child is Coming""
Jefferson Starship, BLOWS AGAINST THE EMPIRE

Rumor: When played backward, ""son of Satan.""
Findings: Another phonetic coincidence. The repeated ""It's getting
better"" reverses to an iffy ""son of Satan,"" the ""of"" drawn out and
the ""Satan"" strongly accented on the first syllable.


""Eldorado""
Electric Light Orchestra, ELDORADO

Rumor: When played backward, ""He is the nasty one/ Christ, you're
infernal/ It is said we're dead men/ Everyone who has the mark
will live.""
Findings: Coincidence. The supposed message lurks around the line
""On a voyage of no return to see."" Reversed, this passage becomes
the expected syllable salad -- no one hearing it would describe it
as anything but reversed music. Only if you listen while reading
along with what you're supposed to hear will you get anything. The
rumored version of the message is somewhat fudged. The passage
sounds more like ""He's to nasty one/ Christ you are, Christ,
you're fernal/ There wiss uh, we're dead men..."" There is no ""in""
in what is taken to be ""infernal."" The line that is supposed to be
""Everyone who has the mark will live"" isn't even close, though the
syllable count is right.


""Shoo Be Doo""
The Cars, CANDY-O

Rumor: When played backward, the word ""Satan"" repeated
approximately eleven times.
Findings: Coincidence. The rumor refers to the reversal of the ""Shoo
be doo, shoo be doo, shoo be doo..."" near the end of the song. Given
the mysterious logic of reversed phonemes, these three-syllable units
can be hard as a repeated two-syllable word. The word sounds a little
like ""Satan.""


""Snowblind""
Styx, PARADISE THEATER

Rumor: According to a mimeographed list of suspect records distributed
by Congressman Dornan, the words ""Satan move through our voices"" when
played backwards.
Findings: Negative. Despite repeated listenings, it was not even
possible to identify the part of the reversed track that Dornan et al.
are talking about.


""Stairway to Heaven""
Led Zeppelin, untitled, a.k.a. STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN

Rumor: In reverse, ""I live for Satan... The Lord turns me off...
There's no escaping it... Here's to my sweet Satan... There's power in
Satan... He will give you 666.""
Findings: Coincidence. If you listen very carefully to the ""And it
makes me wonder"" lines in reverse, you'll hear something approaching
""There's no escaping it."" A better description is ""There's no escape
do."" Knock of the last syllable, and you have ""There's no escape,"" a
complete, intelligible sentence in reverse. It's there, all right, but
it's not an unlikely enough coincidence to -- well, make you wonder.
      The ""Satan"" in ""I live for Satan"" is good and clear. The ""I live
for"" part isn't. The other alleged lines are unremarkable. All are
phonetic reversals of the entirely lucid forward lyrics and obviously
just accidents.


""When Electricity Came to Arkansas""
Black Oak Arkansas, BLACK OAK ARKANSAS and RONCH AND ROLL

Rumor: In reverse, ""Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan. He is God. He
is God.""
Findings: The BLACK OAK ARKANSAS cut was reversed. Again, pairs of
reversed syllables are being freely interpreted as ""Satan."" ""He is
God"" was not identifiable.


""Rain""
The Beatles, HEY JUDE

Rumor: Unintelligible lyrics at the end are reversed.
Findings: A true engineered reversal and not really a secret. ""Rain""
seems to have been the first popular recording to incorporate an
obviously reversed lyric. The story is that John Lennon accidentally
spliced the last part of the song in backward and liked the effect.
When reversed, the strange-sounding vocals at the end become
intelligible as a reprise starting with the drawn-out word
""sunshine.""
      The reversal is less apparent to the casual listener than it
might be because the accompanying music is not reversed. The ending
fits in smoothly with the rest of the song, the vocals suggesting a
foreign language.


""Fire on High""
Electric Light Orchestra, FACE THE MUSIC

Rumor: When played backward, ""The music is reversible, but time --
turn back!""
Findings: ""Fire on High"" is instrumental. About twenty-six seconds
into the music, scrambled speech is heard. It is mostly louder than
the accompanying music and begins with a two-syllable unit repeated
several times. The seeming speech lasts for about fourteen seconds.
      Reversing the music confirms that there is a true, engineered
message. In reverse, a voice (Jeff Lynne's?) says, ""The music is
reversible, but time -- turn back! Turn back! Turn back! Turn back!""
All the words are clear and unambiguous. Anyone comparing this to the
alleged reversal on ELO's ""Eldorado"" will have no trouble telling
which is genuine.


""Goodbye Blue Sky""
Pink Floyd, THE WALL

Rumor: In reverse, ""You have discovered the secret message.""
Findings: The ""secret message"" is at the very end of the instrumental
passage following the ""Goodbye Blue Sky"" vocals. It comes just before
the words ""What shall we do"" at the start of the song that is
identified as ""Empty Spaces"" on the record label and as ""What shall we
do now?"" on the record sleeve. Played forward, the message is less
apparent than the FACE THE MUSIC reversal: A reasonably attentive
listener might play THE WALL through and not catch it. It suggests
speech not quite close enough to be overheard. In context this is not
unusual because the ""Goodbye Blue Sky"" instrumental passage includes
""airport noises"" and other sound effects. A loud climax in the music
further masks the unintelligible voice.
      When played backward, the voice (Roger Waters?) plainly intones,
""Congratulations, you have just discovered the secret message. Please
send your answer to old Pink, care of the funny farm..."" As the voice
fades out, there may be another word -- perhaps ""Chalfonte or
""Chelsea"" -- after ""funny farm.""


""Heavy Metal Poisoning""
Styx, KILROY WAS HERE

Rumor: A red sticker on the KILROY WAS HERE cover warns, ""By order of
the Majority for Musical Morality, this album contains secret backward
messages...""
Findings: This is a case of second-generation backward-masking. Styx'
PARADISE THEATER did not contain a backward message, though a lot of
people said it did. So Styx has included a sure enough backward
message on KILROY WAS HERE. It is at the very beginning of ""Heavy
Metal Poisoning."" The reversed speech last about three seconds. There
is no musical background. The words reverse to ""Annuit coeptis. Novus
ordo seclorum."" This is the Latin motto encircling the pyramid on the
back of a dollar bill. The usual translation: ""God has favored our
undertakings. A new order of the ages.""
      The cover sticker's ""Majority for Musical Morality"" is a
fictitious Falwellesque group in the KILROY WAS HERE video. Although
the sticker suggests a plurality of ""messages,"" only one was found.


Space between ""I'm So Tired"" and ""Blackbird""
The Beatles, untitled, a.k.a. THE WHITE ALBUM

Rumor: A reversed message. At the time of the Paul-is-dead stories,
the segue from ""I'm So Tired"" to ""Blackbird"" was offered as evidence.
It was held to contain John Lennon's voice, reveresed, saying ""Paul is
dead, miss him, miss him, miss him."" That interpretation seems
unlikely now, but there is a mysterious low muttering between the
songs.
Findings: The mumbling is actually just to the ""I'm So Tired"" side of
the shiny ""space"" between cuts on the record. Each of the stereo
tracks was recorded separately, twice, and a copy of each track was
reversed. This produced four versions of the two-second passage: right
forward, left forward, right reversed, and left reversed. All were
equally unintelligible. It was not even apparent whether the voice is
forward or reversed. Nor could John Lennon be identified as the
speaker. There are nine or ten syllables. The first six (when played
forward) are a two-syllable unit repeated three times. There is little
or no difference betwen the stereo tracks. Any claimed interpretation
of the sounds seems doubtful.


""Strawberry Fields Forever""
The Beatles, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR

Rumor: It was, of course, claimed that John Lennon says ""I buried
Paul"" at the end. (It's forward, at the very end after the music
fades to complete silence, returns, and starts to fade out again.)
But Lennon told ROLLING STONE that the words are ""cranberry
sauce.""
Findings: They are ""cranberry sauce."" The ""sauce""/""Paul"" part is
indistinct, but the first syllable sounds a lot more like ""cran""
than ""I.""


""Baby You're a Rich Man""
The Beatles, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR

Rumor: On one of the tracks the line ""Baby you're a rich man too""
is sung as ""Baby you're a rich fag Jew,"" a dig at Brian Epstein.
Or some think it's ""rich fat Jew"" and claim it as evidence of
Beatle anti-Semitism.
Findings: Negative. The two stereo tracks are nearly identical.
It's always possible to hear words as similar-sounding words, but
basically, the lyrics jibe with the published version.


""Revolution 9""
The Beatles, untitled, a.k.a. THE WHITE ALBUM

Rumor: Various reversed and/or one-track speech. The reversal of
""Number nine"" to ""Turn me on, dead man"" has pretty much been
discounted as coincidence (though it appears on Congressman
Dornan's list).
Findings: Distinction between lyrics and any hidden message blurs
on ""Revolution 9."" The eight-minute cut is a montage of sounds
collected by John Lennon and Yoko Ono. It includes discordant
music, radio broadcasts, sirens, applause, gunfights, sports
cheers, the crackling of a fire, screams, a baby gurgling, a choir
singing, and much that cannot be identified. For this
investigation, ""Revolution 9"" was transcribed four times, twice on
each stereo channel. One copy of each of the tracks was reversed.
The four resulting versions were compared with each other and
against the original two-channel version.
     ""Revolution 9"" contains a lot of talking. Played in stereo,
forward, the longest stretch of understandable speech is probably
an announcer saying, ""...every one of them knew that as time went
by they'd get a little bit older and a little bit slower...""
     One believable instance of reversed speech occurs: someone
saying ""Let me out! Let me out!"" (once held to represent McCartney
in his totaled Aston-Martin). Two iffy reversals occur on the
backward recording of the right stereo track:""She used to be
assistant"" and ""There were two men..."" Neither is clear enough or
long enough to be convincing. Some of the music, including the
recurring theme, sounds more natural in reverse.
     ""Turn me on, dead man"" is a typical phonetic reversal. The
forward ""number nine"" (repeated throughout the cut) is clear; the
reversal is slurred -- something like ""turn me on dedmun."" It has
been claimed that ""number nine"" must be pronounced with a British
accent or with some careful inflection in order to reverse to
""Turn me on, dead man."" This seems not to be so. As an experiment,
three American-accent renderings of ""number nine"" were reversed.
All sound about as much like ""Turn me on, dead man"" as the record
did. Like the other phonetic reversals, ""Turn me on, dead man""
must be considered a coincidence.
     Much of ""Revolution 9"" is on one stereo track only. Near the
end a voice says ""A fine natural imbalance...the Watusi...the
twist...Eldorado...Eldorado."" ""A fine natural imbalance"" is on the
right track only, though the words that follow are in stereo. One
of the longer bits of speech -- ""Who could tell what he was
saying? His voice was low and his [unintelligible] was high and
his eyes were low"" -- is clear on the left track, a bare whisper
on the right.
     There is a stereophonically concealed ""secret message"" on
""Revolution 9."" The words are on the right track. They begin about
four minutes, fifty-eight seconds into the cut and run for about
twenty-two seconds. They are not likely to be noticed in stereo
because of the much louder left track. The sound of applause
begins on the left track at about five minutes, one second into
the cut. Deafening noises -- the clapping, sirens, music --
continue on the left track until five minutes, forty seconds. It
may or may not have been Lennon's and Ono's intention to conceal
the spoken passage. Given the haphazard quality of ""Revolution 9,""
the concealment may have been accidental. To recover the passage,
the left track must be switched off. The right track can then be
heard to contain a sound like a stopwatch ticking, behind these
words:

     So the wife called, and we better go to see a
     surgeon....[A SCREAM MUFFLES A LINE THAT SOUNDS LIKE
     Well, what with the prices, the prices have snowballed,
     no wonder it's closed.] ...So any and all, we went to
     see the dentist instead, who gave him a pair of teeth,
     which wasn't any good at all. So instead of that he
     joined the bloody navy and went to sea.
                      by William Poundstone
                              1986

     There really are backward messages on rock albums. And the
controversy over ""backward masking"" and ""porn rock"" has inspired a
whole new spate of messages. There may have been more genuine
backward messages in the past few years than ever before.
     The backward message controversy is usually traced to the
1960s and John Lennon's avant-garde sound mixing on such tracks as
""Revolution 9"" on the Beatles' WHITE ALBUM. Lennon probably wasn't
trying to conceal a message so much as create an interesting
sound.
     The matter might have ended right there had it not been for
the Paul McCartney death rumor. College kids tried playing Beatles
records forward, backward, and at various speeds to find ""clues""
to McCartney's fate. In the process they found snippets of speech
from Lennon's experiments. Even after McCartney was found safe and
sound in Scotland, some listeners continued to look for hidden
messages.
     Somehow, fundamentalist Christian groups became convinced
(ca. 1982) that the alleged messages were commercials for devil
worship. Not a single indisputable satanic message has turned up,
but there were scattered attempts to ban or label certain albums.
In 1986 one fundamentalist group announced that the theme song for
the old MR. ED TV show contains the word ""Satan"" when played
backward.)
     Ironically, the publicity accorded nonexistent messages has
inspired several artists -- among them porn rock hearing witness
Frank Zappa -- to hide real background messages in their music.
It's easy to do.
     The performer speaks or sings the message normally, then
reverses the tape, which is mixed into the soundtrack. This is all
accomplished simply enough at any recording studio.
     What's not so simple is playing it back. More home record,
cassette, and compact disk players won't play backward. You can
turn a record backward with a pencil eraser, but it's not good for
the needle or the turntable. The only way to reproduce the message
with full fidelity is to use a professional-quality reel-to-reel
tape player and splice the tape in backward.
     We used the facilities of KLOS radio in Los Angeles to
reverse some recent records containing true backward messages.


""Secret Messages""
Electric Light Orchestra, SECRET MESSAGES

ELO's ELDORADO album was among those alleged to contain satanic
backward masked messages. A patient listening to ELDORADO played
backward reveals no such messages. You hear only what you ought to
hear -- the reversed lyrics of the songs, which sound nothing like
the ""messages"" claimed to be there. In the wake of such
allegations, ELO did put an (innocuous) backward message on their
FACE THE MUSIC album. Perhaps they thought this would show how
silly the allegations were. Instead, the backward-masking people
seized on this as proof that the other ""messages"" were real. In
the latest volley, ELO has named an album after the controversy.
     In Britain (where the backward-masking issue is viewed as an
American eccentricity), the cover of SECRET MESSAGES has a mock
warning label to youth about the hidden label. Word of the albums'
impending release in the United States caused enough of a furor to
chill CBS Records into deleting the cover blurb.
     The reversed message is easy to find. It's at the beginning
of the first song, which is itself called ""Secret Messages."" You
can hear reversed speech when you play the record normally. A
voice intones ""secret messages"" -- forward -- in the middle of the
reversed speech, lest anyone dare be so unhip as to not know
what's going on.
     We transferred a new copy of SECRET MESSAGES to reel-to-reel
tapes and played it backward. The backward message goes: ""WELCOME
TO THE BIG SHOW/ WELCOME TO THE BIG SHOW.""
     That's it.


""Ya Hozna""
Frank Zappa, THEM OR US

""Ya Hozna,"" a six-minute composition on the first record of the
THEM OR US double album, is ENTIRELY backward. The albums' inner
cover, which includes lyrics for the other songs, says, ""backwards
vocal -- you figure it out"" of this cut. It credits Frank and Moon
Zappa, George Duke, and Napoleon Murphy Brock as vocalists.
     Played forward, ""Ya Howza"" sounds like a record played
backward -- reasonably so. The vocals are prominent and
unintelligible. Moon Zappa's voice is curiously recognizable, even
in reverse. It is hard to tell whether the music was recorded
forward or backward.
     When ""Ya Howza"" is played in reverse, you discover that the
music is virtually a palindrome -- it sounds about the same
forward and backward. The voices are all backward. In some cases
they have been modified electronically. Many of the words are
muffled. Even after repeated careful listening on both stereo
tracks, it is difficult to make out many of the lyrics. It doesn't
help that some of the words seem to be stream-of-consciousness
nonsense. Some of the unintelligible stuff sounds like opera.
     Starting at the beginning of the reversed tape -- the end of
the forward tape -- the clearer vocals go like this: ""I am the
heaven, I am the water."" This is in a hymnlike register. ""You are
a lonely little girl./ But your mommy and your daddy hold you."" A
singsong synthesizer voice.
     The most interesting part of the lyrics is an intermittently
orgasmic rap in Moon Zappa's Valley Girl voice. There are three
short monologues:

I'm like green!
I'm like squat!
I'm like soul!
Repeat, like soul!
I'm like pull, push,
Okay, like slow, slow.

You're never too old
Like slow, like slow, like slow
Okay, I like it.


All right, faster, faster,
Go, do it, do it twice,
Yeah, that feels good,
I'm looking great,
Yeah, fer shure!
Like, no way!


""No Anchovies, Please""
J. Geils Band, LOVE STINKS

""No Anchovies, Please"" is a novelty song, really a narration with
sound effects, about a woman who is kidnapped after eating
anchovies. She is taken to a ""foreign-speaking"" country. The sound
effect of the foreign tongue seems reversed. When you do play it
in reverse, it becomes: ""It doesn't take a genius to know the
difference between chicken shit and chicken salad.""


""Darling Nikki""
Prince, PURPLE RAIN

""Darling Nikki,"" cited as porn rock before Congress, is about a
dominatrix in a hotel lobby masturbating with a magazine. In part,
the complaint was that the album cover (flowers, and Prince on a
motorcycle) wasn't explicit enough to warn kids of the suggestive
lyrics. Senator Paula Hawkins apparently was not aware of a
backward message hidden in ""Darling Nikki."" The last thirty-five
seconds of the song is gibberish. The music changes abruptly and
becomes a repeated glottal sound. Then a two-syllable sound is
repeated twice, something like ""heaven, heaven."" Unintelligible
speech follows. At the end is a sound reminiscent of rain or bacon
frying , and wind sounds.
     Played backward, the message becomes:

     Hello, how are you?
     I'm fine 'cause I know that the Lord is coming soon.
     Coming, coming soon.

     It is clearly Prince and the Revolution singing this. The
words are clear but the intonation is funny -- the linger on some
words. Perhaps this is to make the reversed message you hear
playing the record normally a little less conspicuous.
     This is a weird reversal of the supposed secret message
menace. Raunchy forward lyrics conceal a religious secret message.


""Judas Kiss""
Petra, MORE POWER TO YOU

Petra is an obscure group that sings religious songs to a rock
beat. As further proof that things have gone full circle, the
backward-masking controversy prompted Petra to include a wholesome
backward message on their MORE POWER TO YOU album. It is in the
transition between two songs, just before ""Judas Kiss."" Clearly
audible gibberish reverses to this (the husky voice a cross
between George Beverly Shea and Dee Snider): ""What are you looking
for the Devil for, when you ought to be looking for the Lord?""

AFL JoyceM Welcome to the Apple II Music & Sound chat - our discussion will
           be on NoiseTracker - the new FTA music program for the GS.  AFA
           Gene will be our host this evening...Gene, the floor is yours :)

AFA Gene   Hi all... well first I'd like to point out, if y'all aren't aware
           yet, that a spanking new version of NoiseTracker has recently
           been released (9 days ago) and is now available in our New Files
           library. It is version 0.5. I haven't played around with it much
           yet, but it's supposed to fix a lot of the little bugs in 0.3
           (the first version we had online).  NoiseTracker also includes
           the ability to directly import ""modules,"" a term used for a
           certain type of Amiga song file which has become popular among PC
           users using the SoundBlaster sound card.

           Now, via NT, these ""MOD"" files are accessible by the GS. We
           expect to see a lot of activity on this end as far as ports from
           the PC and Amiga go. Note that you should be able to go straight
           to the PC music forum and download any recently uploaded MOD
           songfiles (there was a bug in the first wide release of the PCAO
           software, however, so a bunch of files with dates between around
           March 1991 and September 1991 may not download properly. Note that
           to use these PC MOD files, you'll have to rename the downloaded
           file ""MOD.xxxxxx"" if you want it to show up automatically in NT's
           ""open"" dialog box. (On the PC, all MOD files are named
           ""xxxxxxxx.MOD"" instead.)   Also, if the files are packed with ZIP
           compression, you'll need a program from the Communications Forum
           called AGATE -- it's a terminal program that includes the ability
           to unpack ZIP files.

           Now, I guess the best thing to do would be to talk about our
           favorite songfiles... there have been a few complaints, in fact,
           that people were not being ""descriptive"" enough in their file
           descriptions for uploads in describing the songs.

AFC Eddie  ?

AFA Gene   GA ed

AFC Eddie  Once a MOD file is unpacked with Agate, is a file type change
           needed?

AFA Gene   Nope, since all that NT looks for is the ""MOD."" being the first
           four characters in the filename.

AFC Eddie  OK, Thanks!

Deanna7332 Question...

JonL7      Can you list some of the features of Noisetracker?

AFA Gene   (you don't even need that ""MOD."" if you want to type the name in
           directly.)

Deanna7332 Did any of these mod files have anything to do with FTA's ""Module
           A""

AFA Gene   Sure Jon, right after we answer Deanna's question. Deanna, you
           mean ""Modulae?""

Deanna7332 Yes, that's it.

AFA Gene   Modulae was a demo written by FTA last year. (i'll get to you in a
           sec Doors).  It used SoundSmith v0.95 for all it's music. There
           is no connection between MOD files and Modulae by FTA.

Deanna7332 Throughout the demo it said ""Loading modules""

AFA Gene   Those ""modules"" are not the same as Amiga soundfile ""modules"" --
           you see, what Modulae really was was a ""stringing together"" of a
           bunch of neat little tiny demos that FTA had written. So they
           called each little demo a ""module"" and thus the entire demo as a
           whole, ""Modulae"" (fancy plural of module?)

Deanna7332 Ok I understand.  Thank you. :)

AFL JoyceM Latin, Gene :)

AFA Gene   The term ""MODule"" from the Amiga comes from the idea that all the
           stuff needed to play the songfile (all the instruments + the
           sequence file) are included into one file, the ""module.""

TheDoors1  Gene, I have tried to d/l some recent uploaded MODs in the PC
           music area and still the problem exists.

AFA Gene   As I understand it, the problem was fixed VERY recently (correct
           me on this Joyce) and files uploaded as recently as early
           November still might not work depending on the version of the
           PCAO software that the uploader used.

AFL JoyceM Actually, Gene...I was under the impression that it had been, but
           if Doors is still having a problem, then it must not be fixed.

AFA Gene   What date was the file you tried to d/l, Door?

TheDoors1  umm 11/17, around there

AFA Gene   hmmm.... well i can tell you one thing... if it didn't work, don't
           waste your time again later... the problem is in the Apple
           software's method of d/lling files, and there are no plans to
           upgrade the Apple AO software.

AFL JoyceM I will endeavor to get an answer to that PC downloading
           problem/question :)

ThomasK63  i have a quick question... what can you use to unpack amiga mod
           files? On the PC side, that is.

TheDoors1  Agate Thomas

ELECTMUSIC Doors... what happens on after downloading..

Deanna7332 If it's LZHed you can't unless you have an IBM or
           PC/Transporter.

AFA Gene   If GS-ShrinkIt doesn't have that ability, i don't think there
           exists any such utility on the GS.

TheDoors1  What do you mean Elect?

ELECTMUSIC After you download the file... where do you encounter a problem?

TheDoors1  ok, you know when you download the file and at some point in the
           download the file starts to appear on your screen.  That's when I
           cancel it.

ThomasK63  I am sure soething good can be made w/out resorting to Amiga
           files

AFC Eddie  Yes, Doors, I believe the problem is with the PC software it was
           UL'd with.

TheDoors1  yeah Eddie.

GNO Tim    Amiga MOD files are typically compressed using LHarc.  I've
           uncompressed several on my Unix machine at school.

ThomasK63  good time for someone to make a lharc unpacker...

AFC DYAJim someone might be ;)

GNO Tim    Several people are already

AFC Eddie  Can't wait, Jim!

AFA Gene   Jon, did you have a question?

JonL7      The features of Noisetracker :)

AFA Gene   Oh yes... okay, here goes, in a nutshell, from most important to
           least:


AFA Gene   *  ability to import MOD files

           *  ability to import Soundsmith files

           *  ProDOS 8 based

           *  virtually no editing abilities (not a feature but important to
           know)

AFC DYAJim :)

AFA Gene   *  forgot: and the most important feature of all, the ability to
           hold instrument files in regular system RAM instead of DOC RAM,
           allowing for instruments far beyond the regular 64K limit found
           in ALL other GS music programs.

ThomasK63  I'll buy that!

TheDoors1  I have another question...when you're ready.

AFA Gene   GA Doors

TheDoors1  ok..is it true that NoiseTracker will take in soundsmith files and
           play them more clearly

AFA Gene   Well, as far as ""what you hear,"" yes there is a definite
           difference with some instruments. It does NOT play the sounds
           more ""clearly,"" but it just plays them in a different way. What
           many people seem to like about this ""different way"" is that
           sustained instruments (i.e. instruments designed to be played
           in a loop to simulate a long held note) seem to work better (or
           perhaps simply the way they were originally intended to work).

TheDoors1  I see

Deanna7332 Which takes up more space - MOD or NT  w/soundfile ?

AFA Gene   Deanna, it depends a few things, such as how big the sequence is,
           how many instruments you have, etc. Once you have a lot of
           assorted files, it'll probably average out to be about the same
           give or take a hundred blocks on your HD. So it basically depends
           on whether you prefer to have your instruments separate or not.

Deanna7332 Does playing quality differ with either one ?

AFA Gene   Nope. It's exactly the same either way. Loading time is the same
           too.

AFC Eddie  Can NT save songs as MOD files?

AFA Gene   Nope. It has options for Open and Close module, but these are
           still inactive.

AFA Gene   If there are no more questions, I'd like to talk about which NT
           files out there are the ""hottest,"" since this info could be
           useful to many users who are interested in downloading NT/MOD
           files.

           My personal favorite is ""Lambada,"" which is supplied by FTA with
           the program but is available separately on America
           Online.Everything about this file is really impressive except
           perhaps the sound quality of the horn-ish melody instrument.

           What about y'all, what are your favorite NT files?

AFL JoyceM Gene, there is a classical song for NT, but can't remember the
           name, but it is good.

AFC Eddie  I like Dragnet!

ELECTMUSIC So do I Ed

TheDoors1  I like Seven something

Deanna7332 My most favorite of all mod files is Pleasure Principle

AFC Eddie  <--appreciate's Greg's taste!

AFL JoyceM :)

AFA Gene   Deanna, i assume you got that from a local board?

Deanna7332 I got it from the PC forum here.

TheDoors1  I saw it there also

Deanna7332 I think under ""Pleasure""

AFA Gene   Would you be able to upload it here? If it's really that good, we
           ought to have it available directly in our oun NT lib here (BTW
           folks, we will be releasing a new NoiseTracker software library
           soon!)

AFC Eddie  What a Forum!!!

Deanna7332 That sounds great!

AFL JoyceM Gene, do you think it will be possible for synthLAB files to be
           converted to MOD files?

AFL JoyceM MOD files?

AFA Gene   I doubt it, Joyce. The formats are so diametrically opposed in
           their entire basis of their file formats that it wouldn't be
           worth the time for a programmer to develop such a convertor.

Deanna7332 Isn't it possible to move the mod file from the PC forum to our
           music library?

AFA Gene   But..... it might be worth the time for a MIDI File Format to MOD
           convertor, since these two formats are more widely accepted.

Nuzz       they have nothing better to do Gene

ELECTMUSIC Gene.. some interesting similarities with DTune and NTracker

AFA Gene   They lose the file, tho, Deanna. :)

AFL JoyceM In what way, Greg?

ELECTMUSIC Both Prodos 8

Deanna7332 Shhh they won't know a thing :)

ELECTMUSIC I also believe Bill uses a shuttling of sound data between Doc
           Ram and Ram.

AFC Eddie  Interesting, Greg.

ELECTMUSIC Thats how he gets some of the excellent instrument quality

AFC Eddie  But Diversitune has that one distinction:  MIDI input.

AFL JoyceM Deanna, we would greatly appreciate it if you would upload that
           'Pleasure' song to our library :)

ELECTMUSIC Agreed Ed.. one of the factors FTA doesn't like to incorporate
           into their programs.

Deanna7332 I'll u/l it tonight if possible.

AFL JoyceM Thanks :)

AFC Eddie  Thanks, Deanna!

AFL JoyceM I will send Bill B a copy of NoiseTracker + some MOD files...to
           see what comments we get from him (will send when I get back).

AFC DYAJim What ever happened to that diversitune upgrade that was talked
           about ?

ELECTMUSIC That would be interesting Joyce

AFC Eddie  Bill apparently still working on it, Jim.

ELECTMUSIC I am sure he would appreciate the Prodos 8

AFC DYAJim good..

AFL JoyceM Jim...RSN....he was hoping by Christmas (this year), but he is
           soooo busy with his job, who knows?

AFC DYAJim Oh yeah, I noticed the speed calcuation in NT .5 is inaccurate
           :)

AFC DYAJim I recall he has set a lot of Christmas projected dates :)

ELECTMUSIC He was one of the first ""Free Tools"" experts in breaking all the
           rules for economic sake.

AFC DYAJim like for the vaporware DT inst editor like 2 years ago.

Deanna7332 Are there any Christmas Mod or NT songs?

AFC Eddie  Oh yeah, Diversi-Editor!

AFL JoyceM I know, Jim - but that I know he has been working on.

AFC DYAJim he projected Christmas for it, and it never came :)

AFA Gene   Not yet in AMS, but hopefully the Holiday Contest will change all
           that. :)

AFC DYAJim I look foreward to any upgrades..

AFL JoyceM Not that I am aware of Deanna - you have some?  hint, hint

Deanna7332 Nope sorry.  I was hoping there were some that could be u/led
           here

AFC DYAJim I'll be breaking out the xmas tune book rsn.. I should be able to
           midi a few :) (which rules out nt)

AFL JoyceM Question...

AFC Eddie  It would be more appropriate to have a converter from Appleworks
           spreadsheet to MOD than from MIDI!

AFL JoyceM If I got ahold of an Amiga song (MOD) disk...how would I convert
           them for here?

AFA Gene   You mean an Amiga-formatted disk?

AFL JoyceM Yes

AFC DYAJim Ack.. methinks you need an amiga and a null modem cable or a
           modem.

AFA Gene   Methinks Jim is right

AFC DYAJim LOL!!  Design your music in the spreadsheet then import to NT :)
           IT might actually have better editing?!! :)

AFC Eddie  Right!

AFL JoyceM Me thinks he is right.  If I had them upload to me, would that
           work?

AFA Gene   Yep; should work like a charm.

AFC DYAJim Yah.. as long as they're coming from an amiga

AFL JoyceM Great....I will work on that when I get back  (making note now).

AFL JoyceM Gene, will you get some of those files (NT) sent to that area
           tonight?  If so, I will leave the needed message :)

AFA Gene   That's all I have planned for tonight's chat, Joyce. Yep, I'll
           move some files right now.

AFL JoyceM Thanks...

AFL JoyceM Then we should have our NoiseTracker Library by end of the week in
           AMS :)

ELECTMUSIC Gene... quick question:  Are you launching NTracker from a 3.5
           disk?

AFL JoyceM Okay, guys...I will see you all the week of December 11th (may the
           4th) as I am off on vacation.

AFA Gene   Yep greg

AFC JohnC  Where are you going?

ELECTMUSIC Do you encounter out of memory problems

AFL JoyceM Night all...and Gene, thanks for an excellent chat and great
           explanations of NoiseTracker.

Nuzz       Joyce, I have good news for FutureSound owners. SoundConvert will
           support it in the first release

AFC Eddie  Great, Mike!

AFA Gene   Greg, i always keep my RAMdisk at 0 when using noisetracker. Not
           only are

AFC JohnC  Mike...SoundConvert...released?

AFL JoyceM Great, Mike.  When can we get SoundConvert, Mike? and FutureSound
           :)

AFA Gene   there a couple of bugs with memory management, but if you're
           loading in a MOD file that's really big, NT will eat your RAMdisk.

AFC Eddie  Sounds good.

Nuzz       The manual is being ""layout"". Release date should be about 1st
           week of Dec

ELECTMUSIC Tnxs Gene

AFC JohnC  YES.......WTG Nuzz!!!!!!!!

Deanna7332 Yes, why is there on some MOD files a stop somewhere in the middle
           ?

Deanna7332 That's really frustrating!

AFL JoyceM Mike, leave me E-Mail on when and how I can send your the $$ to
           get it.

AFL JoyceM Again...night all

Nuzz       gee John, I had to do something to explain the delay :)

ELECTMUSIC Thanks Gene for a GREAT chat!

AFC Eddie  Yes, Gene!  Great!

AFA Gene   Thanks Greg, 'night!

AFA Gene   thanx, see y'all later :)

Copyright 1987 Bob Szekely.

    John Michael Osbourne, (known as ""Ozzy"" to his fans), has in his long 
career as vocalist for Black Sabbath had his work with the group misconstrued 
as advocating Satanism.  In a 1983 radio special featuring Ozzy, the 
interviewer expressed precisely this point; ""...Ozzy has always been shrouded 
in the darkest of Satanic imagery.  Yet if you really listen to his music, 
you'll find that what he is saying differs greatly from his image....""(1)  Even 
the group's image has often been described as ""occult and diabolic"".(2)

    The important point to remember here is to differentiate between appearance 
and reality.  Although the name ""Black Sabbath"" conjures up images of witches 
and sorcerers paying homage to Satan for the powers bestowed upon them, this 
does not make it safe to assume that the group that went by this name 
necessarily drew the inspiration from the occult.(3)  The closest they ever 
came to it was a gothic horror film featuring Boris Karloff as narrator; they 
adopted their name directly from the name of this film.(4)  Black Sabbath was 
involved in the black arts as much as Karloff practiced casting spells off-
screen.  Tony Iommi, the group's guitarist, summed it up best when he described 
the group as having basically ""...the same appeal as a horror movie.  It's all 
an act.""(5)










    Just as their film counterpart did, Ozzy and Sabbath found the occult 
mythos to be an effective vehicle for powerful social commentary; particularly 
when put in the context of heavy-metal rock and roll.  Ozzy himself noted that 
there are ""...people who pick up my [album] cover[s] and go...'This guy's got 
to be singing about Devil, doom, death and destruction.'  Which is not the 
case....""(6)

    The late Lester Bangs likened the group to Bob Dylan and William Burroughs, 
describing them all as ""...moralists...trying to deal with a serious present 
situation in an honest way....""(7)  Ozzy and Black Sabbath merely bring to 
light the many evils of our world in their work, to try and make us realize 
that we are all victim to their influence.  They hope to make us recognize 
these evils so that we may take up arms against them; a point Ozzy emphatically 
stresses:  ""...one thing everybody has got to understand about Black Sabbath's 
lyrics.  They're not downer lyrics, they're just telling everybody where it's 
at...""(8)  He also cites the group's most controversial tune, ""Black Sabbath"", 
as a response to the ignorant hippie culture still force when the tune was 
written in 1970:  ""The hippies said: 'The world is beautiful man.' (sic)  You 
only had to look around you to see how crappy it was.  It was ridiculous 
listening to that stuff, let alone playing it, so we just wrote about the world 
the way it really was and how it affected us - and we felt better in ourselves 
because we were really being honest....""(9)

    I   1   HAVE YOU EVER THOUGH ABOUT YOUR SOUL-
        2   CAN IT BE SAVED?
        3   OR PERHAPS YOU THINK THAT WHEN YOU ARE DEAD
        4   YOU JUST STAY IN YOUR GRAVE.
        5   IS GOD JUST A THOUGHT WITHIN YOUR HEAD OR IS
        6   HE A PART OF YOU?
        7   IS CHRIST JUST A NAME THAT YOU READ IN A BOOK
        8   WHEN YOU WERE AT SCHOOL?

    II  9   WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT DEATH DO YOU LOSE
        10  YOUR BREATH OR DO YOU KEEP YOUR COOL?
        11  WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE THE POPE ON THE END
        12  OF A ROPE - DO YOU THINK HE'S A FOOL?
        13  WELL I'VE SEEN THE TRUTH - YES I'VE SEEN 
        14  THE LIGHT AND I'VE CHANGED MY WAYS.
        15  AND I'LL BE PREPARED WHEN YOU'RE LONELY 
        16  AND SCARED AT THE END OF OUR DAYS.

    III 17  COULD IT BE YOU'RE AFRAID OF WHAT YOU'R
        18  FRIENDS MIGHT SAY 
        19  IF THEY NEW YOU BELIEVED IN GOD ABOVE
        20  THEY SHOULD REALISE BEFORE THE CRITICISE
        21  THAT GOD IS THE ONLY WAY TO LOVE.

    IV  23  IS YOUR MIND SO SMALL THAT YOU HAVE TO FALL
        24 IN WITH THE PACK WHEREVER THEY RUN
        25  WILL YOU STILL SNEER WHEN DEATH IS NEAR
        26  AND SAY THEY MAY AS WELL WORSHIP THE SUN.

    V   27  I THINK IT WAS TRUE IT WAS PEOPLE LIKE YOU
        28  THAT CRUCIFIED CHRIST
        29  I THINK IT IS SAD THE OPINION YOU HADE WAS THE
        30  ONLY ONE VOICED.
        31  WILL YOU BE SO SURE WHEN YOUR DAY IS NEAR
        32  SAY YOU DON'T BELIEVE?
        33  YOU HAD THE CHANCE BUT YOU TURNED IT DOWN
        34  NOW YOU CAN'T RETRIEVE.










    VI  35  PERHAPS YOU'LL THINK BEFORE YOU SAY THAT
        36  GOD IS DEAD AND GONE
        37  OPEN YOUR EYES, JUST REALIZE THAT HE IS THE
        38  ONE.
        39  THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN SAVE YOU KNOW FROM
        40  ALL THIS SIN AND HATE.
        41  OR WILL YOU STILL JEER AT ALL YOU HEAR?
        42  YES!-I THINK IT'S TOO LATE.

    In this piece, the group asserts a belief in an afterlife and spiritual 
redemption.  As grisly as the image of a hanged pontiff is, its shock value is 
a necessary part of the message:  They reject religious dogma, stating that a 
belief in God, in one's own heart, is the only guiding light to help one inn 
his life (lines 11/12, 39/40).  Furthermore, the reject religious hypocrisy 
(lines 5/6, 7/8) and peer pressure (verses III, IV) as excuses for not 
accepting God.  To clarify further:  following the crowd does not justify 
shrugging responsibility for one's own actions.

    After re-reading, it becomes obvious that this song is an ascerbic critique 
of atheism; (line 35/36) I refer here again to verses three and four.  In these 
two verses, the picture painted in one of Godless conformity and how it's 
viewed as being as foolish as Paganism.  These lyrics set an example for the 
listener by relating personal experience (lines 13-16).  However, for those who 
cannot accept this the group has no recourse but to condemn them, although 
rather ironically; they hope that their rhetorical loss of faith in the 
listener will open his eyes (line 42).










                           B L A C K   S A B B A T H 



            WHAT IS THIS, THAT STANDS BEFORE ME?
            FIGURE IN BLACK, WHICH POINTS AT ME
            TURN ROUND QUICK AND START TO RUN
            FIND OUT I'M THE CHOSEN ONE.  OH, NO!
            
            BIG BLACK SHAPE WITH EYES OF FIRE
            TELLING PEOPLE THEIR DESIRE
            SATAN'S SITTING THERE, HE'S SMILING
            WATCHES THOSE FLAMES GET HIGHER AND HIGHER
            OH, NO, NO, -- PLEASE GOD HELP ME!
            
                IS THIS THE END MY FRIEND?
                SATAN'S COMING 'ROUND THE BEND
                PEOPLE RUNNING 'CAUSE THEY'RE SCARED
                THE PEOPLE BETTER GO AND BEWARE
                NO, NO!  PLEASE--NO!!
                
                
    The all time controversy winner!  Is this not irrefutably  THE song about 
Black Magic in rock?  It's all so obvious, suffuse with evil imagery; Satan, 
walls of flame, figure in black, and damnation at the end.  Yes, I see the 
images too; it definitely concerns Black Magic.  Then again, Shakespeare's 
Macbeth employed scenes of witches involved in conjurations; does that mean 
that Shakespeare was a warlock?  Poe used to write sardonic tragedies about 
twisted murderers and the bizarre nature of acts, did that make him an evil, 
leering, demented killer?  Did either of them advocated what they wrote about?  
One has to remember that writing about something is not necessarily the same as 
emulating it.  Tony Iommi spoke out quite strongly about this:  ""People are 
bringing us down saying that we are a Black Magic group.  I think they must be










getting mixed up with Black Widow.  We don't do any sacrifices on stage, and 
we're not on a black magic kick.  We wanted to do heavy numbers and the guitar 
riffs we worked out were more suited to evil things than love.  We play songs 
about black magic, but they are more likely to be against than for it.""(12)  

    By now, you're probably asking yourself who Black Widow is, right?  Then 
it's time for a little history:

        Sabbath, before they were known as Sabbath, had the same line-up but 
two earlier names.  The first one was Polka Tulk, which seemed sure to doom 
them to obscurity.(13)  The soon realized this and changed the group's name to 
Earth.  Now, Earth was a blues band at the end of the English blues boom.  As 
if that wasn't bad enough, they soon discovered that not only was there another 
group named Earth, but they had also released a single.  To avoid confusion, 
they changed their name again.(14)  But what made them decide on that name?  
Just ask Ozzy:  ""I just liked the name Black Sabbath because of the succession 
of vowel sounds.(15)  If that sounds ludicrous just consider this:  Sabbath was 
""...the first of the really committed, loud and heavy bands...""(16)  They 
needed a name to match the gut-wrenching power they were developing.  Tony knew 
that he wanted Sabbath to be noticed above all the rest of the British blues 
bands:  ""We wanted something of our own that we'd like and people would like.  
And we wanted something loud!""










    Tony didn't hate the blues.  He'd cut his teeth as a guitarist on the likes 
of The Shadows, Buddy Holly and Django Rheinhardt, developing his own style 
from there.  But he realized the group had no future in the blues:

        'We couldn't keep playing 12-bars forever.  We just got fed up with 
Earth music.  It was jazz, blues stuff.  It was good for practice but nothing 
else.'

    In the late 'Sixties, blues groups were a dime a dozen in Birmingham and 
interest was waning in the blues boom due to the glut of groups.  One man, by 
the name of Jim Simpson, had heard Earth around the Birmingham club circuit and 
understood what they were trying to do.  He decided to take them under his 
wing.  With the aid of his massive record collection, Jim expanded the group's 
horizons in the areas of jazz and blues.  He introduced them to artists like 
Wes Montgomery, Count Basie and Jimmy Rushing.  It was from Rushing in 
particular that they derived the repetitive riff style so readily noticeable in 
their later incarnation as Black Sabbath.

    The Count Basie influence is evidenced in the song ""Wicked World"" from the 
first album; Sabbath drummer Bill Ward uses a ""'sighing hi-hat'...in the manner 
of Basie's drummer Jo Jones.""










    The influence is subtle, almost subliminal.  Yet it is one which was not 
thought capable of hard, 'heavy' rock bands in the late 'Sixties.  Although Led 
Zeppelin and Jimi Hendrix also had their work steeped in blues and jazz 
derivations (Hendrix' ""Third Stone From the Sun"" and Zeppelin's version of 
Willie Dixon's ""I Can't Quit You Baby"" from their first album), neither was 
able to match the intense energy of Black Sabbath.  Iommi has always had a 
preference for music with an original, distinct style of its' own; as an 
example, he mentions guitarists Joe Pass and Alvin Lee as two of his strongest 
songwriting influences.

    It would also be necessary that Sabbath develop a unique, distinctive style 
and image of their own.  Though they had changed their name from Earth to Black 
Sabbath to avoid confusion with the other Earth; at the same time another group 
emerged by the name of Black Widow ""...who WERE profoundly influenced by the 
occult, had a male witch as a patron, and wrote pieces like ""Come to The 
Sabbat.""  Unfortunately, Sabbath was constantly reaping the benefits of Widow's 
publicity.

    Sabbath was a group that never minced words.  If they saw something as 
destructive, they would be sure to rub the listener's face it it.  They did not 
want their point to be missed.

    With their straightforward, sometimes brutal way of looking at things, they 
try to shock the listener's conscience back into awareness.  The imagery of 
""Hand of Doom"", from the Paranoid album, is candid and condemning; it is a 
strong statement against drug addiction and rightly so...

            FEEL YOUR BODY HEAVE
            DEATH'S HANDS START TO WEAVE
            
            IT'S TO LATE TOO TURN
            YOU DON'T WANNA LEARN
            PRICE OF LIFE YOU CRY
            NOW YOU'RE GONNA DIE
            
            
    Many people felt the group's overall direction was pessimistic and had a 
negative effect on its listener's due to that.  ""Ozzy insisted that if people 
thought he was having a bad effect on the minds of young kids, they should go 
and watch the TV news where real murder and mayhem were a way of life, and 
shown night after night."" (18)

    Sabbath was never negative in their message; they were simply truthful 
about waht they saw as wrong in the world.  If you ""Strip away the horror 
stories, the imagery and the hysteria, (and) turn down the amps a notch...you 
have a well-rehearsed, solid blues and rock band, powered by a dedication to 
well defined objectives.""  On the top of the list of those objectives was 
truth; Sabbath never feared facing that truth squarely, regardless of what many 
people thought of them.

Long, long, time ago,
I can still remember,
When the local calls were ""free"".
And I knew if I paid my bill,
And never wished them any ill,
That the phone company would let me be...

But Uncle Sam said he knew better,
Split 'em up, for all and ever!
We'll foster competition:
It's good capital-ism!

I can't remember if I cried,
When my phone bill first tripled in size.
But something touched me deep inside,
The day... Bell System... died.

And we were singing...

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

Is your office Step by Step,
Or have you gotten some Crossbar yet?
Everybody used to ask...
Oh, is TSPS coming soon?
IDDD will be a boon!
And, I hope to get a Touch-Tone phone, real soon...

The color phones are really neat,
And direct dialing can't be beat!
My area code is ""low"":
The prestige way to go!

Oh, they just raised phone booths to a dime!
Well, I suppose it's about time.
I remember how the payphones chimed,
The day... Bell System... died.

And we were singing...

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

Back then we were all at one rate,
Phone installs didn't cause debate,
About who'd put which wire where...
Installers came right out to you,
No ""phone stores"" with their ballyhoo,
And 411 was free, seemed very fair!

But FCC wanted it seems,
To let others skim long-distance creams,
No matter 'bout the locals,
They're mostly all just yokels!

And so one day it came to pass,
That the great Bell System did collapse,
In rubble now, we all do mass,
The day... Bell System... died.

So bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

I drove on out to Murray Hill,
To see Bell Labs, some time to kill,
But the sign there said the Labs were gone.
I went back to my old CO,
Where I'd had my phone lines, years ago,
But it was empty, dark, and ever so forlorn...

No relays pulsed,
No data crooned,
No MF tones did play their tunes,
There wasn't a word spoken,
All carrier paths were broken...

And so that's how it all occurred,
Microwave horns just nests for birds,
Everything became so absurd,
The day... Bell System... died.

So bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

We were singing:

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?

on that Resurrection Day!             where he'll hit you with a pie!

I hear Valkyries a-comin                There are people into Voodoo
In the air their song is comin          there are people into Voodoo
They forgot the words! They're hummin!  I know I do, I hope you do!
But they're good enough for me!         and it's good enough for me!

We will venerate Bubastis             We will read from the Kabahlah

With bold Gilgamesh the Brave!      but that's good enough for me!

We will all see Aphrodite               We will all sing Hare Krishna
Though she's pretty wild and flighty    We will all sing Hare Krishna
She will meet us in her nightie         It's not mentioned in the Mishna
And she's good enough for me!           But it's good enough for me!

It was good enough for Loki         We will all go to Nirvana

He thinks Thor's a little hokey     Make a left turn at Urbana

Here's to those who copy Conan    There will be a lot of lovin
Here's to those who copy Conan    when we're meetin in our Coven
They're just Followers of Onan    Quit yer pushin and yer shovin
and that's good enough for me!    So there's room enough for me!

We will have a mighty Party           It was good enough for Sappho
In the honor of Astarte               With her lady on her lap-o
Grab your chiton - don't be tardy     She put Lesbos on the map-o
'Cause she's good enough for me!      With her pagan poetry!

Shall we sing a verse for Venus,    Well the Christians all are humming
Of the Gods she is the meanest,     Cause they say their God is coming,
Cause she bit me on my...elbow      Our God came three times this evening
And it's good enough for me.        And that's good enough for me.

We will worship like the Druids,      Some guys have a circumcision
Drinking strange fermented fluids,    On account of their religion,
Running naked through the woo-ids,    An embarrassing incision
Coz that's good enough for me.        Cut just ENOUGH from me!   

We will sing a verse for Loki       It was good for old Jehovah
He's the old Norse god of Chaos     He had a son who was a nova!
Which is why this verse don't       Hey there, Mithras! Move on ova'!
       rhyme or scan or nothin'     Another resurrection Day!
But it's good enough for me...

It was good for Thor and Odin       It could be that you're a Parsi

There are those who, when they've got e-
Normous problems that are knotty
They just take them to Hecate         Thanks to great Quetzacoatl
And that's good enough for me!        And his sacred axolotl
                                      And his gift of chocolatl

And that's good enough for me!        But that's good enough for me!

Let us sing the praise of Horus    We went off to worship Venus
As our fathers did before us       By the Gods! You should have seen us!
We're the New Egyptian Chorus      Now the Clinic has to screen us...
And we sing in harmony!            But that's good enough for me!

Hare Krishna gets a laugh on         I'll arise at early mornin'

Well, that's good enough for me!     To know that's right for me!

Lilith wears a lacy nightie        That Bob Larson shrieks and hollers

She's wet-dream enough for me!     And that's good enough for me.

We will drive up to Valhalla         We will all bow to Hephaestus
Riding Beetles, not Impalas          As a blacksmith he will test us

And that's good enough for me.       So he's good enough for me.

We will sing of Iluvatur,             We will sing of Foul the Render,
Who sent the Valar 'cross the water   Who's got Drool Rockworm on a bender
To lead Morgoth to the slaughter      In his cave in Kiril Threndor--
And that's just fine with me.         They're both too much for me.

   Lady Trude thought it her duty
   To turn a social wrong into a Right
   Proved her point with Imperium Compound
   And showed that Cheshire Cats can fight!  //and scratch//

   The Board of Directors styled themselves The Electors
   And another con they tried to swing
   Now the BoD drinks Imperium Compound
   So we no longer need a King!                        

   AltChorus: Oh the Bod, the BoD, the BoD,
              It thinks it is God, is God, is God,
              The figure of Supreme Authority!
              And if we O.D.'d on Imperium Compund
              there'd be no need for Royalty!          

   Oh, MEDIEVAL Net, we thought it was all wet
   With witty remarks, and other kinds of sass
   We'll feed our computers on Imperium Compound
   And BYTE the BoD right on its' righteous ass!         

   Good old Duncan was often drunken
   Chasing all the ladies fair
   He bathed himself in Imperium Compound
   Now he has a little savoir faire!

  ATEN IMPERIUM (cont.)

   Ioseph of Locksley, never changes his socks, he
   Runs around looking like a Cavalier,
   He stocked up on Imperium Compound
   And he has enough to last for years and years!        

   AltChorus: Oh they forgot, forgot, forgot
              The Locks-e-ly Plot, the Plot, the Plot!
              And it works the best when it is underground!
              It isn't a hassle for a green-and-white tassle
              They're the ones that BREW Imperium Compound!  

   Trelon of the Wood, he was very good, he
   Was a leader that had never been beat before;
   But Caid had Imperium Compound,
   And Imperial Roman Caid won the War!  //with help!//   

   In Tyr Ysgithr, it's regularly whispered there
   That the Kingdom is ruled over by a King    // What's THAT? //
   They're ""democratic"" and quite erratic....
   They've forgot the purpose of the whole damn thing!     

   King Sir Mark von, with his pretty white suit on,
   Rules the Kingdom both with Grace and Purity!
   He never touches Imperium Compound
   At least not where anyone else can see!               

   Duke Sir Deaton, was never beaten
   On the field, or in the drinking hall;
   At the Catbox War with Caid,
   Left thirty bodies piled against the wall!             

   Denis O'Titans was good at smitin'
   A Locksley Monster in every single way!
   Drank a little Imperium Compound
   And ATE Deaton's sword that day  // No! REALLY! //       

   Wotan the Mongoloid, a little bit paranoid,
   But a nice guy none the less;
   Drank a mess of Imperium Compound
   Now he's Justin du Roc, I confess!                       

   Then there's Duke Reynard, with a face like a St. Bernard
   Of the Dukes, he is the homliest
   He tends to toke up on Imperium Compound
   And go out and whomp on anybody's best!                   

   This song'll bedevil the folks at a revel,
   And most of the time it will annoy the King,
   So take a drink of Imperium Compound
   And let's go Royalty-bedeviling!                        

   Duchess Anna is quite a fan-a
   Going on a wartime shopping spree!  \\ War Point!\\
   Took a drink of Imperium Compound
   And shopped so fast we couldn't see! \\ Z-o-o-o-om!\\    (5)

  ATEN IMPERIUM (Cont.)

   Lyn of Whitewolfe, made of the right stuff,
   Twice the Queen of Atenveldt;
   Took a drink of Imperium Compound
   And the Kingdom of Caid before her knelt!              

   Duke Sir Brion, and Duke Sir Trelon,
   Won the Crown with regularity;
   Drank a lot of Imperium Compound,
   And founded a dynasty!                                 

   Stephan von Geist, was most awful nice,
   And a chivalrous fighter without any doubt
   Took a swig of Imperium Compound
   And won the Crown his first time out!                    

   All the Crusadenes were big, but not mean,
   And the finest fighters in the town.
   But they all drank Jerusalem Compound,
   Winning Crown after Crown after Crown!                 

   Good Duke Arthur couldn't get no farth-er
   A Norman King in Aten Land
   Drank too much of Imperium Compound
   And went off to conquer Engel-land!                    

   Then King Richard, a bit of a bitch, heard
   A King's Crown could be done.
   Drank a little Imperium Compound
   And became the Aten King, first one!                    

   Duchess Malinda, who doesn't do windas,
   But she does a lot of Duchess Things,
   But give her a LOT of Imperium Compound,
   And she sings and sings and sings and sings and sings!   

   Duke Sir Brion, with his pretty white suit on,
   Is a model of goodness and purity
   Never touches Imperium Compound
(spoken:) And I'll sell ya seashore property in Yuma, too!  

   Optional last verse:

   Many tales abound of Imperium Compound
   And its' strange effects on Royalty,
   But after an hour, this song has no power,
   And by now, it's boring ME!                            

   AltChorus: Oh it's too long, too long, too long
              To sing the whole song, the song, the song
              Longer than a Royal Court, it is!
              But sing it serial, this ditty Imperial
              And you'll be a bardic whiz!

        Last night I had the strangest dream in this bleak century
        I dreamed that people the world around believed in Chivalry

        I dreamed I saw a Kingly Crown enshrined in laurel leaves
        with Grace and Joy and Purity attendant at his feet

        I dreamed I saw the perfect Knight receive his accolade
        and minstrels sang and children laughed in some soft forest glade

        I dreamed I saw the finest thing that ever man could make
        grow great and strong and undefiled: Pray God I never wake!

        Last night I had the strangest dream in this bleak century
        I dreamed that people the world around believed in Chivalry

               (to the tune of ""Good King Wenceslaus"")

                Locksley Monsters never yield
                on the field of battle
                strike the helm and bash the shield
                make their eyeteeth rattle
                Bodies on the ground will lie
                bones will burst in sunder
                search for Locksleys' enemies:
                You'll find them six feet under!

                              SONG OF IVANOF

            There is a man who we know well that does the best he can
            but he's displayed in armour made of reticulated garbage cans!

            He looks so fine and fair and strong, oh how he plays the man
            and how it's prized, those galvanized, reticulated garbage cans

            The noblest Roman of them all, a good Praetorian
            a combatant who wears no pants, judst reticulated garbage cans!

            Like old Horatius at the Bridge, like the Legions of Valerian
            (O dearie me: those LOVELY knees!)
            and those reticulated garbage cans!

         (sung to the tune (obviously) of the 12 Days of Christmas)


1.           The first time I sent my device, The Heralds said to me

            ""It violates the Rule of Three""

2.           The next time I tried it, the Heralds said to me

            ""We changed the forms, and it violates the Rule of
             Three"".

3.           The third time I tried, and the Heralds said to me, 

            ""We upped the fees, we changed the forms, and it
             violates the Rule of Three"".

4.           Another time I tried and the Heralds said to me,
 
            ""We haven't got it, we upped the fees, we changed the 
             forms, and it violates the Rule of Three"".

5.           The fifth time I tried it, the Heralds said to me,  

            ""In a decision rendered by the College of Arms on
             August 1st, A.S. V it was decided that this style of
             heraldic design was not appropriate to the aims and 
             intentions of the Corporate Body. Holy! Holy! Holy! ""

 note: verse 5 is delivered in an extremely fast, mono-
       tone, similiar to a Gregorian Chant.

           "" ....we haven't got it, we upped the fees, we changed the forms,
             and it violates the Rule of Three.""

6.           I tried it a sixth time, and the Heralds said to me,

            ""We changed the rules, &c""

7.           A seventh time I tried and, the Heralds said to me,

            ""It's against the Rule of Tincture, we changed the
             rules, &c""

8.           I tried it once again and the heralds said to me,

            ""It's not a Period design, It's against the Rule of Tincture, We
             changed the rules, &c""

                                * more *



    Heralds Said To Me (cont.)

9.           I sent it in once more, and the Heralds said to me,

            ""We changed the rules again, It's not a Period design,
             it's against the Rule of Tincture, we changed the
             rules, &c""

10. (sung in cold anger)
             The LAST time I sent my device, the Heralds said to me

    (sung in a state of SMUG)
             ""Someone else has got it, &c""




              (nb: every single one of these reasons has been used by the
              CoA, at one point or another, to reject perfectly good
              heraldry, along with some even MORE stupid.  If the shoe 
              fits....................!!!!!!!!)

           or: Who was that Vermin I saw you with last, Knight?
   or: There may be Lice on all you Knice, but there ain't no Lice on me

           Once there was a Barony howling in the wilderness
           nestled in the Valley where the River doesn't flow
           and the folks were driven buggy by the insects in the Revel Hall
           Authenticity is wonderful, but this doesn't go!

                   Bugs on the Baroness, bugs on the Baroness!
                   That was the cry that you heard all the day
                   and the scratching can be heard from Ysgithr to Ered Sul
                   why did we come here? Let's go away!

           See them all a scratching, nestled in their armour tight
           the fleas have a melee team that's challenging the field!
           call Truly Nolen! Someone's gotta help us out!
           the crabs are nesting in our helms but we'll never yield!

                   (chorus)

           Dawn comes a-breaking, the bugs have won the Coronet...
           flea-infested Conan-clones in piles upon the lawn
           where is the Barony? The bugs have eaten everyone...
           termites got the stick-jocks, and all their sticks are gone!

                  For all the Lands where I have dwelt
                  Oh Atenveldt, Oh Atenveldt
                  till rivers burn and mountains melt
                  lest I forget my Atenveldt
                  From deserts stark to snow-capped peaks
                  from silent lakes and laughing creeks
                  sing: Oh let man find his heart's ease
                  on rocky plains
                  in desert breeze

                  For oft I thought of mighty men
                  who carved a Land with sword and pen
                  and lit a candle, burning bright,
                  that pierced the darkness; stirred the night!
                  tho some are gone their deeds remain
                  this sunny Crown without a stain
                  sing: Oh, their deeds were not in vain!
                  in sunlit days
                  and falling rain.....

                  So raise your banners, blazoned bright
                  Advance the Dream and Shine the Light!
                  in battle's crash and Revel's song
                  raise high the Flag and wave it long!
                  For all the Lands wherein I've dwelt
                  I love you best, my Atenveldt!
                  Sing: Oh the Joy that I have felt!

      What the use of wearing panties
      whalebone corsets of your Auntie's
      boxer shorts and other scanties
      best of all is nude
      there's such fun in going bra-less
      now that it's no longer lawless
      'specially if your figure's flawless
      best of all is nude
      nude is what you're born in
      shirts are never torn in
      underwear and lacy flimsies, garter belts and other whimsies
      yards of itchy cloth to put your form in
      ducks all do it, maidens rue it
      even ancient Picts in Britain blue it
      going naked's how to do it
      best of all is nude!

      If your garters aren't elastic
      tie them up in knots fantastic
      (panty hose is something drastic!)
      best of all is nude!
      If you're tired of wearing clotheses
      shed your garment 'mongst the roses
      never mind the old bluenoses
      best of all is nude!
      Nude is best for ducking!
      Worst for horses bucking!
      Moonlit nights will see such sights
          that are very best for fooling round
                              .....and elbows!
      Nudity is grand to see
       a well-known antidote to virginity
      take your clothes off and you'll see:
      best of all is nude!

                                  spread their seeds thruout the Land

                                  Came the Stag from oaken wood
                                  saw the Lady where she stood
                                  by the fire burning bright
                                  came to know his heart's delight!

                   (end of extra verses)

                   By Sword and Harp, and Irish Hound
                   Blessed Be: the Day I've found
                   Hail to the Lady, one in Three
                   Present is Past and Past is WE

                   By Oak and Ash and Holy Thorn
                   bledded be the Day you're born!
                   Fire burn and fire bright

               I'll tell you a tale of Peace and Love
                       whack fol the diddle o the di do day
               Of those that Rule all Lands above
                       whack fol the diddle o the di do day
               may Peace, and Plenty be their share
               that keep our Empire in repair

               When we were Sauvage, Fierce and Wilde
               they came as a Mother to her childe
               they gently raised us from the slime
               and kept our hands from Hellishe Crime
               and made us a Kingdom in their own good time

               Now, Atenveldt forgets the Past
               and thinks on a Day that's coming fast
               when we shall all be....civilized....(puke)
               neat, and clean.....and WELL-ADVISED
               oh won't the Directors be....suprised?!

                    WEAPONS AT THE DOOR

 Being a Polemic concerning the alleged Custom of the West Kingdom concerning 
 checking your Weapons at the Door of the Revel Hall. As the Satire is the 
 Weapon of the Bard, this said Polemic is to be checked at the Door, along with 
 swords, knives, redheaded Ladies and other such Deadly Things.....

         As I roved out to Western Lands to take the Western Air
         I went into a Revel Hall and I saw a Twelfth Night there
         but I was halted at the gate by a Privy Consellor
                 (that's the man who tells the King of the West how to go to
                  the bath room!)
         who told me I would have to check my Weapons at the door

         As I, in my astonishment, stood hung on tenter-pegs
         a Knight came in whose Prouess hung down between his legs
         the Doorman grabbed a greatsword and he struck the Knight full sore
         and gave him a reciept; he left his weapon at the door!

         a Bard was next whose goodly Voice has entertained us all
         but he, too, was prevented from entering the Hall
         and told he could not carry deadly weapons on the floor
         he left his Voice and Harp among the weapons at the door

         a Master entered graciously, a man we all know well
         who holds a 3rd Dan Black Belt, tho this he'd never tell
         the Master struggled valiantly, the Master cursed and swore
         but he left his hands, and feet, as weapons at the door

         the company was jovial, altho a bit dismayed
         for lack of proper cutlery, down to the smallest blade
         for even teeth and fingernails, each can be used in War
         were cut, and pulled, and left behind, as weapons at the door!

         And has their King not loyal Knights that He must be afraid
         of brawling in his Hall and of Assassin's bloody blade?
         the Rights of Men to carry Arms at least WE'VE not foreswore
         and a POX on them that made the Rule of Weapons at the Door!

                           THE STREETS OF ANN ARBOR

               As I walked out thru the streets of Ann Arbor
               as I walked out thru Ann Arbor one day
               I spied a young Mongol all dressed in white linen
               all dressed in white linen and cold as the clay

               I then spied another, done in on the sidewalk
               along with just about six dozen more
               their wounds were all gaping, from mace and from braoadsword
               from claymore and cannon, all dripping with gore

               what caused this grave carnage, I cried to the Monglos
               oh pray what's the reason for this awful sight
               my answer came slowly from under the corpse-pile
               ""It seems that our bark is much worse than our bite.....""

               the answer continued from pale lips a-shaking
               we sang all our songs and believed them as true
               the Dark Horde could never be beaten in battle
               we thought this was what all good Mongols could do...

               we went down to Atenveldt all for to plunder
               ""too large to defend"" was our song every night
               but Atenveldt's different from East, West or Middle
               there, even the bushes have learned how to bite!

               the Clann stole our ponies, the Scraelings our foodstuffs
               we ran into axes in AtenViking hands
               our maidens ran off with one Richard of Arkham
               and we're all that's left to return to our lands

               MacChluarains and Monsters, Lockehaven and Foxmoor
               that Kingdom is BIG and its' fighters are MEAN!
               we fought and we lost, and fled back to Ann Arbor
               we all came back home with results that you've seen

               keep away from that Land with its' cactus and marshes
               it's no place for Mongols who are bent on War
               they count their blows well, but they strick them yet better
               he crawled into his Yurt, and fell, dead, on the floor.....

                            C. A. Bethancourt III
       tune: the song of the Cowardly Lion, Tin Woodsman and Scarecrow
             in the movie version of the Wizard of Oz

        (Enter the Scarecrow, who singeth:)

        My wife is always nagging; my Prowess it is lagging
        I can't do anything
        she has got a reason, but revenge is out of season
        Oh I wish I could be King!

        If I just had the Crown on, I'd always have a frown on
        and the Barons on a string
        Heads they would be rolling, the Board would be cajoling
        Oh if only I was King!

        I am very fed up with the way this group is set up
        Oh I'd change everything!
        they are so high and mighty with the way that they do fight-ey
        Oh, someday I'll be King!

        Tho my wife is melancholic, and very...vitriolic
        she's a wasp without a sting!
        I'd have to supervise her with a pack of tranquilizers
        If I only was a King......

        (the Tin Woodsman joineth him, and singeth:)

        I grew up kind of cocky, and rather big, and stocky
        and straight as any rod
        on the field I'm a battallion, with the Ladies I'm a stallion
        ...Oh they'd better make me God!

        The other boys are jealous they say I'm over-zealous
        they'd do better to applaud
        the things that I am giving to this Dream that we are living
        oh I wish they'd make me God!

        They say that I'm conceited, but I'm just badly treated
        by people and by BoD
        just think of what they're missing by My Majesty dismissing
        Oh they'd better make me God!

        (the Cowardly Lion creepeth forth, and singeth:)

        Oh I could be a fighter, a great and mighty smiter
        and be the perfect knight
        it's a great and nasty shame, and everyone's to blame
        oh I wish that I could fight!

                                * more *




        Song of the Three (cont.)

        I could be a Cavalier drinking wine and ale and beer
        and be a gorgeous sight
        but it would cost me too much money so it isn't very funny
        oh I wish that I could fight!                               

        Let me at 'em on the field, I would surely make them yield
        to my Power and my Might
        with rattan, shinai and rapier they would nevermore escape here
        If they'd only let me fight

                She was afraid to come out to the Tourney
                She was worried that ""something might show..""
                She was afraid to come out to the Tourney
                And the poor thing did NOT want to go...

                  (2 - 3 - 4, tell the people what she wore!)

                  It was an itsy bitsy teeny weenie little rabbit fur bikini
                  That she wore, for the first time, that day.
                  An itsy bitsy teenie weenie little rabbit fur bikini
                  And in her apartment she wanted to stay!

                One day in the Kingdom of the Middle
                It happened at a Tourney one day:
                The Mongols invaded the Middle
                But the Middle did not want to play...

                  (eins - zwei - drei, but the Dark Horde wouldn't die!)

                  It was an itsy bitsy tiny teenie Nauseating Mongol weenie
                  That they saw, for the first time, that day.
                  An itsy bitsy tiny teenie Nauseating Mongol weenie
                  And the Mongols did NOT go away!

                Now the Heralds made up a new Rulebook
                And to read it is some kind of gas!
                It's a bureaucrat's dream, this new Rulebook
                Now NOBODY'S blazon can pass!

                  (Win - Place - Show, tell the Heralds where to go!)

                                 (insert Bronx cheer!)

                  I want an itsy bitsy teenie weenie little rabbit fur bikini
                  On my shield, as my blazon, today!
                  An itsy bitsy teenie weenie little rabbit fur bikini
                  But ""that's offensive"" the Heralds all say!

                I sat down at the Revel last evening
                To a feast of green meat, and Rat Pie...
                It was cold, and disgusting, and greasy
                And I just want to upchuck and die!

                  (6 - 7 - 8, tell them what was on your plate!)

                  It was an itsy bitsy teenie weenie little rabbit fur bikini
                  With a side dish of cold cabbage pie!
                  An itsy bitsy teenie weenie little rabbit fur bikini

          Some folks call me many names, others call me crazy
          Tom O'Bedlam's son am I, for my mind is hazy!
          I'd rather sing a song than work (if it's not too phrasey!)
          Lengthy rhymes don't bother me....truth to tell: I'm lazy!

          Yang, your yurt is very nice, and your Horde is smelly,
          And I'm sure that yak-meat will nicely fill one's belly!
          But remember this one line, or you're not worth jelly:
          FIRST you plunder, THEN you burn! That's how to be rakehelly!

          My Lady Lorelei your eyes do drive me to distraction
          And the lovely Care-Cheri causes....petrifaction!
          But I, and they, quite taken are, so I can't take action...
          Therefore, Ladies, fill my cup; I'll drink to stupefaction!

          Now Atenveldt your fighters, all, are most good and gentle
          And the Ladies, bless 'em all, are most ornamental!
          But that little Nikki-Toad....has me sentimental
          Though with boffer in her hand she is argumental!

          This stupid little song, m'lords, is mostly sung in Latin
          By the Goliards, of course, from vespers clear to matins!
          But I prefer a coarser cloth over silk or satins
          English is more understood, mine enemies to flatten!

          Good People all, I've made my Song, its' music's well-recited
          But my voice could use some work; the flowers it has blighted!
          It's rude and rusty, grim and bad, and squeaky like a door-hinge,
          But I'm a better Bard than you: I found a rhyme for ""orange!""

                      by William Poundstone
                              1983

     Two mentalities are at work here: 1960s rock fans and 1980s
fundamentalist Christians. The idea of phonographically concealed
messages dates from the Paul McCartney death scare of 1969. For
hard-core types, the secret-message rumors never really died. Avid
rock fans have auditioned ever album release since the late 1960s
for hidden nuances. Backward messages, barely audible messages,
and messages on one stereo track only have been alleged. At the
other end of the sociosensual spectrum, fundamentalist Christians
have gotten into the act. TV programs such as PRAISE THE LORD and
THE 700 CLUB have propagated rumors of a satanic plot in the
recording industry, no less, in which various albums conceal
""backward-masked"" demonic murmurings. If THAT sounds too spacey to
be taken seriously, consider that it was the fundamentalist groups
who were behind House Resolution 6363, a bill introduced in the
U.S. House of Representatives by Robert K. Dornan (R., Calif.) in
1982 to label all suspect records: ""WARNING: THIS RECORD CONTAINS
BACKWARD MASKING THAT MAKES A VERBAL STATEMENT WHICH IS AUDIBLE
WHEN THIS RECORD IS PLAYED BACKWARD AND WHICH MAY BE PERCEPTIBLE
AT A SUBLIMINAL LEVEL WHEN THIS RECORD IS PLAYED FORWARD."" In
February 1983, the Arkansas State Senate passed a similar record-
labeling bill by a vote of 86 to 0.
     Contributing to the quasi-occult status of these rumors is
the difficulty of checking them out on home audio equipment. You
pretty much have to take someone else's word for it, or dismiss
the rumors out of hand.
     From a technical standpoint, there are four simple ways to
conceal a verbal message on a recording. The most obvious is to
record the message at a very low volume. The message may then be
recovered by turning the volume up while playing the record or
tape. If the message is faint enough, though, noise levels of home
equipment may garble it. If the accompanying music or lyrics are
loud enough, or if the message itself is indistinct or
electronically modified, it may be hard to hear on any equipment.
     A second gimmick is to record a message on one stereo track
only. Records and tapes have two independent recordings, of
course, normally played simultaneously for stereo effect. On a
record, each stereo track occupies on one side of the V-shaped
groove for the needle. On a tape, the tracks are recorded in
parallel lanes of the magnetic material. The two tracks are called
""right"" and ""left"" after the stereo speakers they will play on.
Otherwise, the tracks are interchangeable -- the sound mixer can
put anything he or she wants on each track. A message on one track
can be masked by simultaneous loud music or lyrics on the opposite
track. With normal stereo balance (or mono equipment) the loud
track drowns out the message track. At home, single-track messages
can be recovered by adjusting the stereo balance so that only the
desired track plays. Sometimes this trick also makes indistinct
words clearer. Even if the words are not exclusively on one track,
they may happen to be more audible on one track.
     A message could be recorded at a speed different from the
rest of the record. Then the record would have to be played faster
or slower than usual to recover the message. Unless the message
was at one of the standard speeds (say, 45 rpm on a 33 1/3 rpm
record), it could not be played normally on home equipment.
     The fourth and most commonly alleged trick is to record a
verbal message backward. Reversed speech has several unexpected
features. One is that syllables are not a constant in the reversal
process. A one-syllable word can have two or three syllables when
played backward. Thus ""number nine"" in the Beatles' REVOLUTION 9
reverses to ""Turn me on, dead man"" (or something like it), a jump
from three to five syllables.
     There is no simple way to predict what a word or phrase will
sound like reversed. Obviously, you can't just reverse the
letters.
     Reversed messages are difficult to recover at home. Record
turntables are not built to go backwards. Some have a neutral
setting, in which the pickup and amplifier remain active and you
can turn the record backward by hand. But hardly anyone has a
stead enough hand to produce satisfactory results.
     With patience, it is possible to reverse a cassette
recording. Transfer the music from the original record or tape
onto a blank tape cassette. Place the cassette flat on a table.
Draw our the part of the tape with the suspected message and snip
it off at both ends. Hold the tape segment horizontally. Rotate it
180 degrees, keep it horizontal at all times. This turns the tape
end for end. Splice the reversed tape segment back onto the two
loose ends of the cassette with strong adhesive tape. Reel the
tape back inside the cassette. The sliced segment will play
backward on an ordinary cassette player.
     I rented a recording studio to test the secret-message
rumors. New copiies of the records in question were transcribed on
a quarter-inch master tape. Where rumor alleged that a single
stereo track contained a message, right and left stereo tracks
were transcribed separately. Records with alleged inaudible
messages were treated similarly. To test claims of reversed
messages, recordings on the master tape were edited out and
spliced in backward. Twenty cuts or portions of cuts from sixteen
albums were tested.


""Another One Bites the Dust""
Queen, THE GAME

Rumor: When played backward, the lyrics say, ""It's fun to smoke
marijuana.""
Findings: There is something that sounds like ""It's fun to smoke
marijuana"" in the reversed music. It is repeated over and over. It
might be rendered no less faithfully, however, as ""sfun to scout
mare wanna."" This ""message"" is the reversal of the song title,
which is repeated as a line in the song.
     Let's make a distinction between engineered and phonetic
reversals. When an artist records a verbal statement, reverses it
by turning the tape end for end, mixes the reversed statement onto
a master tape, and has records and tapes produced from the master,
that is an engineered reversal. When the phonetic properties of
song lyrics are such that they can be reversed to sound like
something else, that is a phonetic reversal.
     ""It's fun to smoke marijuna"" is clearly a phonetic reversal.
The lyrics are perfectly plain played forward (""Another one bites
the dust""), no so plain played backward (""sfun to scout mare
wanna""). With an engineered reversal, the opposite should hold
true: gibberish forward, clear as a bell backward. Some are
prepared to believe that phonetic reversals are just as
intentional as engineered reversals -- that the songwriter
painstakinginly planned the phonetic double-entendre. In the
absence of confirming evidence, that just doesn't wash. It's too
easy to find coincidences. If, for example, the letters of the
alphabet are recited in conventional fashion (Ay, Bee, Cee, etc.)
and reversed, at least five sound like English language words. D
reverses to ""eden,"" F becomes ""pray,"" S becomes ""say,"" V becomes
""even,"" and Z becomes ""easy."" ""It's fun to smoke marijuana"" is
likewise a coincidence.


""A Child is Coming""
Jefferson Starship, BLOWS AGAINST THE EMPIRE

Rumor: When played backward, ""son of Satan.""
Findings: Another phonetic coincidence. The repeated ""It's getting
better"" reverses to an iffy ""son of Satan,"" the ""of"" drawn out and
the ""Satan"" strongly accented on the first syllable.


""Eldorado""
Electric Light Orchestra, ELDORADO

Rumor: When played backward, ""He is the nasty one/ Christ, you're
infernal/ It is said we're dead men/ Everyone who has the mark
will live.""
Findings: Coincidence. The supposed message lurks around the line
""On a voyage of no return to see."" Reversed, this passage becomes
the expected syllable salad -- no one hearing it would describe it
as anything but reversed music. Only if you listen while reading
along with what you're supposed to hear will you get anything. The
rumored version of the message is somewhat fudged. The passage
sounds more like ""He's to nasty one/ Christ you are, Christ,
you're fernal/ There wiss uh, we're dead men..."" There is no ""in""
in what is taken to be ""infernal."" The line that is supposed to be
""Everyone who has the mark will live"" isn't even close, though the
syllable count is right.


""Shoo Be Doo""
The Cars, CANDY-O

Rumor: When played backward, the word ""Satan"" repeated
approximately eleven times.
Findings: Coincidence. The rumor refers to the reversal of the ""Shoo
be doo, shoo be doo, shoo be doo..."" near the end of the song. Given
the mysterious logic of reversed phonemes, these three-syllable units
can be hard as a repeated two-syllable word. The word sounds a little
like ""Satan.""


""Snowblind""
Styx, PARADISE THEATER

Rumor: According to a mimeographed list of suspect records distributed
by Congressman Dornan, the words ""Satan move through our voices"" when
played backwards.
Findings: Negative. Despite repeated listenings, it was not even
possible to identify the part of the reversed track that Dornan et al.
are talking about.


""Stairway to Heaven""
Led Zeppelin, untitled, a.k.a. STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN

Rumor: In reverse, ""I live for Satan... The Lord turns me off...
There's no escaping it... Here's to my sweet Satan... There's power in
Satan... He will give you 666.""
Findings: Coincidence. If you listen very carefully to the ""And it
makes me wonder"" lines in reverse, you'll hear something approaching
""There's no escaping it."" A better description is ""There's no escape
do."" Knock of the last syllable, and you have ""There's no escape,"" a
complete, intelligible sentence in reverse. It's there, all right, but
it's not an unlikely enough coincidence to -- well, make you wonder.
      The ""Satan"" in ""I live for Satan"" is good and clear. The ""I live
for"" part isn't. The other alleged lines are unremarkable. All are
phonetic reversals of the entirely lucid forward lyrics and obviously
just accidents.


""When Electricity Came to Arkansas""
Black Oak Arkansas, BLACK OAK ARKANSAS and RONCH AND ROLL

Rumor: In reverse, ""Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan. He is God. He
is God.""
Findings: The BLACK OAK ARKANSAS cut was reversed. Again, pairs of
reversed syllables are being freely interpreted as ""Satan."" ""He is
God"" was not identifiable.


""Rain""
The Beatles, HEY JUDE

Rumor: Unintelligible lyrics at the end are reversed.
Findings: A true engineered reversal and not really a secret. ""Rain""
seems to have been the first popular recording to incorporate an
obviously reversed lyric. The story is that John Lennon accidentally
spliced the last part of the song in backward and liked the effect.
When reversed, the strange-sounding vocals at the end become
intelligible as a reprise starting with the drawn-out word
""sunshine.""
      The reversal is less apparent to the casual listener than it
might be because the accompanying music is not reversed. The ending
fits in smoothly with the rest of the song, the vocals suggesting a
foreign language.


""Fire on High""
Electric Light Orchestra, FACE THE MUSIC

Rumor: When played backward, ""The music is reversible, but time --
turn back!""
Findings: ""Fire on High"" is instrumental. About twenty-six seconds
into the music, scrambled speech is heard. It is mostly louder than
the accompanying music and begins with a two-syllable unit repeated
several times. The seeming speech lasts for about fourteen seconds.
      Reversing the music confirms that there is a true, engineered
message. In reverse, a voice (Jeff Lynne's?) says, ""The music is
reversible, but time -- turn back! Turn back! Turn back! Turn back!""
All the words are clear and unambiguous. Anyone comparing this to the
alleged reversal on ELO's ""Eldorado"" will have no trouble telling
which is genuine.


""Goodbye Blue Sky""
Pink Floyd, THE WALL

Rumor: In reverse, ""You have discovered the secret message.""
Findings: The ""secret message"" is at the very end of the instrumental
passage following the ""Goodbye Blue Sky"" vocals. It comes just before
the words ""What shall we do"" at the start of the song that is
identified as ""Empty Spaces"" on the record label and as ""What shall we
do now?"" on the record sleeve. Played forward, the message is less
apparent than the FACE THE MUSIC reversal: A reasonably attentive
listener might play THE WALL through and not catch it. It suggests
speech not quite close enough to be overheard. In context this is not
unusual because the ""Goodbye Blue Sky"" instrumental passage includes
""airport noises"" and other sound effects. A loud climax in the music
further masks the unintelligible voice.
      When played backward, the voice (Roger Waters?) plainly intones,
""Congratulations, you have just discovered the secret message. Please
send your answer to old Pink, care of the funny farm..."" As the voice
fades out, there may be another word -- perhaps ""Chalfonte or
""Chelsea"" -- after ""funny farm.""


""Heavy Metal Poisoning""
Styx, KILROY WAS HERE

Rumor: A red sticker on the KILROY WAS HERE cover warns, ""By order of
the Majority for Musical Morality, this album contains secret backward
messages...""
Findings: This is a case of second-generation backward-masking. Styx'
PARADISE THEATER did not contain a backward message, though a lot of
people said it did. So Styx has included a sure enough backward
message on KILROY WAS HERE. It is at the very beginning of ""Heavy
Metal Poisoning."" The reversed speech last about three seconds. There
is no musical background. The words reverse to ""Annuit coeptis. Novus
ordo seclorum."" This is the Latin motto encircling the pyramid on the
back of a dollar bill. The usual translation: ""God has favored our
undertakings. A new order of the ages.""
      The cover sticker's ""Majority for Musical Morality"" is a
fictitious Falwellesque group in the KILROY WAS HERE video. Although
the sticker suggests a plurality of ""messages,"" only one was found.


Space between ""I'm So Tired"" and ""Blackbird""
The Beatles, untitled, a.k.a. THE WHITE ALBUM

Rumor: A reversed message. At the time of the Paul-is-dead stories,
the segue from ""I'm So Tired"" to ""Blackbird"" was offered as evidence.
It was held to contain John Lennon's voice, reveresed, saying ""Paul is
dead, miss him, miss him, miss him."" That interpretation seems
unlikely now, but there is a mysterious low muttering between the
songs.
Findings: The mumbling is actually just to the ""I'm So Tired"" side of
the shiny ""space"" between cuts on the record. Each of the stereo
tracks was recorded separately, twice, and a copy of each track was
reversed. This produced four versions of the two-second passage: right
forward, left forward, right reversed, and left reversed. All were
equally unintelligible. It was not even apparent whether the voice is
forward or reversed. Nor could John Lennon be identified as the
speaker. There are nine or ten syllables. The first six (when played
forward) are a two-syllable unit repeated three times. There is little
or no difference betwen the stereo tracks. Any claimed interpretation
of the sounds seems doubtful.


""Strawberry Fields Forever""
The Beatles, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR

Rumor: It was, of course, claimed that John Lennon says ""I buried
Paul"" at the end. (It's forward, at the very end after the music
fades to complete silence, returns, and starts to fade out again.)
But Lennon told ROLLING STONE that the words are ""cranberry
sauce.""
Findings: They are ""cranberry sauce."" The ""sauce""/""Paul"" part is
indistinct, but the first syllable sounds a lot more like ""cran""
than ""I.""


""Baby You're a Rich Man""
The Beatles, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR

Rumor: On one of the tracks the line ""Baby you're a rich man too""
is sung as ""Baby you're a rich fag Jew,"" a dig at Brian Epstein.
Or some think it's ""rich fat Jew"" and claim it as evidence of
Beatle anti-Semitism.
Findings: Negative. The two stereo tracks are nearly identical.
It's always possible to hear words as similar-sounding words, but
basically, the lyrics jibe with the published version.


""Revolution 9""
The Beatles, untitled, a.k.a. THE WHITE ALBUM

Rumor: Various reversed and/or one-track speech. The reversal of
""Number nine"" to ""Turn me on, dead man"" has pretty much been
discounted as coincidence (though it appears on Congressman
Dornan's list).
Findings: Distinction between lyrics and any hidden message blurs
on ""Revolution 9."" The eight-minute cut is a montage of sounds
collected by John Lennon and Yoko Ono. It includes discordant
music, radio broadcasts, sirens, applause, gunfights, sports
cheers, the crackling of a fire, screams, a baby gurgling, a choir
singing, and much that cannot be identified. For this
investigation, ""Revolution 9"" was transcribed four times, twice on
each stereo channel. One copy of each of the tracks was reversed.
The four resulting versions were compared with each other and
against the original two-channel version.
     ""Revolution 9"" contains a lot of talking. Played in stereo,
forward, the longest stretch of understandable speech is probably
an announcer saying, ""...every one of them knew that as time went
by they'd get a little bit older and a little bit slower...""
     One believable instance of reversed speech occurs: someone
saying ""Let me out! Let me out!"" (once held to represent McCartney
in his totaled Aston-Martin). Two iffy reversals occur on the
backward recording of the right stereo track:""She used to be
assistant"" and ""There were two men..."" Neither is clear enough or
long enough to be convincing. Some of the music, including the
recurring theme, sounds more natural in reverse.
     ""Turn me on, dead man"" is a typical phonetic reversal. The
forward ""number nine"" (repeated throughout the cut) is clear; the
reversal is slurred -- something like ""turn me on dedmun."" It has
been claimed that ""number nine"" must be pronounced with a British
accent or with some careful inflection in order to reverse to
""Turn me on, dead man."" This seems not to be so. As an experiment,
three American-accent renderings of ""number nine"" were reversed.
All sound about as much like ""Turn me on, dead man"" as the record
did. Like the other phonetic reversals, ""Turn me on, dead man""
must be considered a coincidence.
     Much of ""Revolution 9"" is on one stereo track only. Near the
end a voice says ""A fine natural imbalance...the Watusi...the
twist...Eldorado...Eldorado."" ""A fine natural imbalance"" is on the
right track only, though the words that follow are in stereo. One
of the longer bits of speech -- ""Who could tell what he was
saying? His voice was low and his [unintelligible] was high and
his eyes were low"" -- is clear on the left track, a bare whisper
on the right.
     There is a stereophonically concealed ""secret message"" on
""Revolution 9."" The words are on the right track. They begin about
four minutes, fifty-eight seconds into the cut and run for about
twenty-two seconds. They are not likely to be noticed in stereo
because of the much louder left track. The sound of applause
begins on the left track at about five minutes, one second into
the cut. Deafening noises -- the clapping, sirens, music --
continue on the left track until five minutes, forty seconds. It
may or may not have been Lennon's and Ono's intention to conceal
the spoken passage. Given the haphazard quality of ""Revolution 9,""
the concealment may have been accidental. To recover the passage,
the left track must be switched off. The right track can then be
heard to contain a sound like a stopwatch ticking, behind these
words:

     So the wife called, and we better go to see a
     surgeon....[A SCREAM MUFFLES A LINE THAT SOUNDS LIKE
     Well, what with the prices, the prices have snowballed,
     no wonder it's closed.] ...So any and all, we went to
     see the dentist instead, who gave him a pair of teeth,
     which wasn't any good at all. So instead of that he
     joined the bloody navy and went to sea.
                      by William Poundstone
                              1986

     There really are backward messages on rock albums. And the
controversy over ""backward masking"" and ""porn rock"" has inspired a
whole new spate of messages. There may have been more genuine
backward messages in the past few years than ever before.
     The backward message controversy is usually traced to the
1960s and John Lennon's avant-garde sound mixing on such tracks as
""Revolution 9"" on the Beatles' WHITE ALBUM. Lennon probably wasn't
trying to conceal a message so much as create an interesting
sound.
     The matter might have ended right there had it not been for
the Paul McCartney death rumor. College kids tried playing Beatles
records forward, backward, and at various speeds to find ""clues""
to McCartney's fate. In the process they found snippets of speech
from Lennon's experiments. Even after McCartney was found safe and
sound in Scotland, some listeners continued to look for hidden
messages.
     Somehow, fundamentalist Christian groups became convinced
(ca. 1982) that the alleged messages were commercials for devil
worship. Not a single indisputable satanic message has turned up,
but there were scattered attempts to ban or label certain albums.
In 1986 one fundamentalist group announced that the theme song for
the old MR. ED TV show contains the word ""Satan"" when played
backward.)
     Ironically, the publicity accorded nonexistent messages has
inspired several artists -- among them porn rock hearing witness
Frank Zappa -- to hide real background messages in their music.
It's easy to do.
     The performer speaks or sings the message normally, then
reverses the tape, which is mixed into the soundtrack. This is all
accomplished simply enough at any recording studio.
     What's not so simple is playing it back. More home record,
cassette, and compact disk players won't play backward. You can
turn a record backward with a pencil eraser, but it's not good for
the needle or the turntable. The only way to reproduce the message
with full fidelity is to use a professional-quality reel-to-reel
tape player and splice the tape in backward.
     We used the facilities of KLOS radio in Los Angeles to
reverse some recent records containing true backward messages.


""Secret Messages""
Electric Light Orchestra, SECRET MESSAGES

ELO's ELDORADO album was among those alleged to contain satanic
backward masked messages. A patient listening to ELDORADO played
backward reveals no such messages. You hear only what you ought to
hear -- the reversed lyrics of the songs, which sound nothing like
the ""messages"" claimed to be there. In the wake of such
allegations, ELO did put an (innocuous) backward message on their
FACE THE MUSIC album. Perhaps they thought this would show how
silly the allegations were. Instead, the backward-masking people
seized on this as proof that the other ""messages"" were real. In
the latest volley, ELO has named an album after the controversy.
     In Britain (where the backward-masking issue is viewed as an
American eccentricity), the cover of SECRET MESSAGES has a mock
warning label to youth about the hidden label. Word of the albums'
impending release in the United States caused enough of a furor to
chill CBS Records into deleting the cover blurb.
     The reversed message is easy to find. It's at the beginning
of the first song, which is itself called ""Secret Messages."" You
can hear reversed speech when you play the record normally. A
voice intones ""secret messages"" -- forward -- in the middle of the
reversed speech, lest anyone dare be so unhip as to not know
what's going on.
     We transferred a new copy of SECRET MESSAGES to reel-to-reel
tapes and played it backward. The backward message goes: ""WELCOME
TO THE BIG SHOW/ WELCOME TO THE BIG SHOW.""
     That's it.


""Ya Hozna""
Frank Zappa, THEM OR US

""Ya Hozna,"" a six-minute composition on the first record of the
THEM OR US double album, is ENTIRELY backward. The albums' inner
cover, which includes lyrics for the other songs, says, ""backwards
vocal -- you figure it out"" of this cut. It credits Frank and Moon
Zappa, George Duke, and Napoleon Murphy Brock as vocalists.
     Played forward, ""Ya Howza"" sounds like a record played
backward -- reasonably so. The vocals are prominent and
unintelligible. Moon Zappa's voice is curiously recognizable, even
in reverse. It is hard to tell whether the music was recorded
forward or backward.
     When ""Ya Howza"" is played in reverse, you discover that the
music is virtually a palindrome -- it sounds about the same
forward and backward. The voices are all backward. In some cases
they have been modified electronically. Many of the words are
muffled. Even after repeated careful listening on both stereo
tracks, it is difficult to make out many of the lyrics. It doesn't
help that some of the words seem to be stream-of-consciousness
nonsense. Some of the unintelligible stuff sounds like opera.
     Starting at the beginning of the reversed tape -- the end of
the forward tape -- the clearer vocals go like this: ""I am the
heaven, I am the water."" This is in a hymnlike register. ""You are
a lonely little girl./ But your mommy and your daddy hold you."" A
singsong synthesizer voice.
     The most interesting part of the lyrics is an intermittently
orgasmic rap in Moon Zappa's Valley Girl voice. There are three
short monologues:

I'm like green!
I'm like squat!
I'm like soul!
Repeat, like soul!
I'm like pull, push,
Okay, like slow, slow.

You're never too old
Like slow, like slow, like slow
Okay, I like it.


All right, faster, faster,
Go, do it, do it twice,
Yeah, that feels good,
I'm looking great,
Yeah, fer shure!
Like, no way!


""No Anchovies, Please""
J. Geils Band, LOVE STINKS

""No Anchovies, Please"" is a novelty song, really a narration with
sound effects, about a woman who is kidnapped after eating
anchovies. She is taken to a ""foreign-speaking"" country. The sound
effect of the foreign tongue seems reversed. When you do play it
in reverse, it becomes: ""It doesn't take a genius to know the
difference between chicken shit and chicken salad.""


""Darling Nikki""
Prince, PURPLE RAIN

""Darling Nikki,"" cited as porn rock before Congress, is about a
dominatrix in a hotel lobby masturbating with a magazine. In part,
the complaint was that the album cover (flowers, and Prince on a
motorcycle) wasn't explicit enough to warn kids of the suggestive
lyrics. Senator Paula Hawkins apparently was not aware of a
backward message hidden in ""Darling Nikki."" The last thirty-five
seconds of the song is gibberish. The music changes abruptly and
becomes a repeated glottal sound. Then a two-syllable sound is
repeated twice, something like ""heaven, heaven."" Unintelligible
speech follows. At the end is a sound reminiscent of rain or bacon
frying , and wind sounds.
     Played backward, the message becomes:

     Hello, how are you?
     I'm fine 'cause I know that the Lord is coming soon.
     Coming, coming soon.

     It is clearly Prince and the Revolution singing this. The
words are clear but the intonation is funny -- the linger on some
words. Perhaps this is to make the reversed message you hear
playing the record normally a little less conspicuous.
     This is a weird reversal of the supposed secret message
menace. Raunchy forward lyrics conceal a religious secret message.


""Judas Kiss""
Petra, MORE POWER TO YOU

Petra is an obscure group that sings religious songs to a rock
beat. As further proof that things have gone full circle, the
backward-masking controversy prompted Petra to include a wholesome
backward message on their MORE POWER TO YOU album. It is in the
transition between two songs, just before ""Judas Kiss."" Clearly
audible gibberish reverses to this (the husky voice a cross
between George Beverly Shea and Dee Snider): ""What are you looking
for the Devil for, when you ought to be looking for the Lord?""

AFL JoyceM Welcome to the Apple II Music & Sound chat - our discussion will
           be on NoiseTracker - the new FTA music program for the GS.  AFA
           Gene will be our host this evening...Gene, the floor is yours :)

AFA Gene   Hi all... well first I'd like to point out, if y'all aren't aware
           yet, that a spanking new version of NoiseTracker has recently
           been released (9 days ago) and is now available in our New Files
           library. It is version 0.5. I haven't played around with it much
           yet, but it's supposed to fix a lot of the little bugs in 0.3
           (the first version we had online).  NoiseTracker also includes
           the ability to directly import ""modules,"" a term used for a
           certain type of Amiga song file which has become popular among PC
           users using the SoundBlaster sound card.

           Now, via NT, these ""MOD"" files are accessible by the GS. We
           expect to see a lot of activity on this end as far as ports from
           the PC and Amiga go. Note that you should be able to go straight
           to the PC music forum and download any recently uploaded MOD
           songfiles (there was a bug in the first wide release of the PCAO
           software, however, so a bunch of files with dates between around
           March 1991 and September 1991 may not download properly. Note that
           to use these PC MOD files, you'll have to rename the downloaded
           file ""MOD.xxxxxx"" if you want it to show up automatically in NT's
           ""open"" dialog box. (On the PC, all MOD files are named
           ""xxxxxxxx.MOD"" instead.)   Also, if the files are packed with ZIP
           compression, you'll need a program from the Communications Forum
           called AGATE -- it's a terminal program that includes the ability
           to unpack ZIP files.

           Now, I guess the best thing to do would be to talk about our
           favorite songfiles... there have been a few complaints, in fact,
           that people were not being ""descriptive"" enough in their file
           descriptions for uploads in describing the songs.

AFC Eddie  ?

AFA Gene   GA ed

AFC Eddie  Once a MOD file is unpacked with Agate, is a file type change
           needed?

AFA Gene   Nope, since all that NT looks for is the ""MOD."" being the first
           four characters in the filename.

AFC Eddie  OK, Thanks!

Deanna7332 Question...

JonL7      Can you list some of the features of Noisetracker?

AFA Gene   (you don't even need that ""MOD."" if you want to type the name in
           directly.)

Deanna7332 Did any of these mod files have anything to do with FTA's ""Module
           A""

AFA Gene   Sure Jon, right after we answer Deanna's question. Deanna, you
           mean ""Modulae?""

Deanna7332 Yes, that's it.

AFA Gene   Modulae was a demo written by FTA last year. (i'll get to you in a
           sec Doors).  It used SoundSmith v0.95 for all it's music. There
           is no connection between MOD files and Modulae by FTA.

Deanna7332 Throughout the demo it said ""Loading modules""

AFA Gene   Those ""modules"" are not the same as Amiga soundfile ""modules"" --
           you see, what Modulae really was was a ""stringing together"" of a
           bunch of neat little tiny demos that FTA had written. So they
           called each little demo a ""module"" and thus the entire demo as a
           whole, ""Modulae"" (fancy plural of module?)

Deanna7332 Ok I understand.  Thank you. :)

AFL JoyceM Latin, Gene :)

AFA Gene   The term ""MODule"" from the Amiga comes from the idea that all the
           stuff needed to play the songfile (all the instruments + the
           sequence file) are included into one file, the ""module.""

TheDoors1  Gene, I have tried to d/l some recent uploaded MODs in the PC
           music area and still the problem exists.

AFA Gene   As I understand it, the problem was fixed VERY recently (correct
           me on this Joyce) and files uploaded as recently as early
           November still might not work depending on the version of the
           PCAO software that the uploader used.

AFL JoyceM Actually, Gene...I was under the impression that it had been, but
           if Doors is still having a problem, then it must not be fixed.

AFA Gene   What date was the file you tried to d/l, Door?

TheDoors1  umm 11/17, around there

AFA Gene   hmmm.... well i can tell you one thing... if it didn't work, don't
           waste your time again later... the problem is in the Apple
           software's method of d/lling files, and there are no plans to
           upgrade the Apple AO software.

AFL JoyceM I will endeavor to get an answer to that PC downloading
           problem/question :)

ThomasK63  i have a quick question... what can you use to unpack amiga mod
           files? On the PC side, that is.

TheDoors1  Agate Thomas

ELECTMUSIC Doors... what happens on after downloading..

Deanna7332 If it's LZHed you can't unless you have an IBM or
           PC/Transporter.

AFA Gene   If GS-ShrinkIt doesn't have that ability, i don't think there
           exists any such utility on the GS.

TheDoors1  What do you mean Elect?

ELECTMUSIC After you download the file... where do you encounter a problem?

TheDoors1  ok, you know when you download the file and at some point in the
           download the file starts to appear on your screen.  That's when I
           cancel it.

ThomasK63  I am sure soething good can be made w/out resorting to Amiga
           files

AFC Eddie  Yes, Doors, I believe the problem is with the PC software it was
           UL'd with.

TheDoors1  yeah Eddie.

GNO Tim    Amiga MOD files are typically compressed using LHarc.  I've
           uncompressed several on my Unix machine at school.

ThomasK63  good time for someone to make a lharc unpacker...

AFC DYAJim someone might be ;)

GNO Tim    Several people are already

AFC Eddie  Can't wait, Jim!

AFA Gene   Jon, did you have a question?

JonL7      The features of Noisetracker :)

AFA Gene   Oh yes... okay, here goes, in a nutshell, from most important to
           least:


AFA Gene   *  ability to import MOD files

           *  ability to import Soundsmith files

           *  ProDOS 8 based

           *  virtually no editing abilities (not a feature but important to
           know)

AFC DYAJim :)

AFA Gene   *  forgot: and the most important feature of all, the ability to
           hold instrument files in regular system RAM instead of DOC RAM,
           allowing for instruments far beyond the regular 64K limit found
           in ALL other GS music programs.

ThomasK63  I'll buy that!

TheDoors1  I have another question...when you're ready.

AFA Gene   GA Doors

TheDoors1  ok..is it true that NoiseTracker will take in soundsmith files and
           play them more clearly

AFA Gene   Well, as far as ""what you hear,"" yes there is a definite
           difference with some instruments. It does NOT play the sounds
           more ""clearly,"" but it just plays them in a different way. What
           many people seem to like about this ""different way"" is that
           sustained instruments (i.e. instruments designed to be played
           in a loop to simulate a long held note) seem to work better (or
           perhaps simply the way they were originally intended to work).

TheDoors1  I see

Deanna7332 Which takes up more space - MOD or NT  w/soundfile ?

AFA Gene   Deanna, it depends a few things, such as how big the sequence is,
           how many instruments you have, etc. Once you have a lot of
           assorted files, it'll probably average out to be about the same
           give or take a hundred blocks on your HD. So it basically depends
           on whether you prefer to have your instruments separate or not.

Deanna7332 Does playing quality differ with either one ?

AFA Gene   Nope. It's exactly the same either way. Loading time is the same
           too.

AFC Eddie  Can NT save songs as MOD files?

AFA Gene   Nope. It has options for Open and Close module, but these are
           still inactive.

AFA Gene   If there are no more questions, I'd like to talk about which NT
           files out there are the ""hottest,"" since this info could be
           useful to many users who are interested in downloading NT/MOD
           files.

           My personal favorite is ""Lambada,"" which is supplied by FTA with
           the program but is available separately on America
           Online.Everything about this file is really impressive except
           perhaps the sound quality of the horn-ish melody instrument.

           What about y'all, what are your favorite NT files?

AFL JoyceM Gene, there is a classical song for NT, but can't remember the
           name, but it is good.

AFC Eddie  I like Dragnet!

ELECTMUSIC So do I Ed

TheDoors1  I like Seven something

Deanna7332 My most favorite of all mod files is Pleasure Principle

AFC Eddie  <--appreciate's Greg's taste!

AFL JoyceM :)

AFA Gene   Deanna, i assume you got that from a local board?

Deanna7332 I got it from the PC forum here.

TheDoors1  I saw it there also

Deanna7332 I think under ""Pleasure""

AFA Gene   Would you be able to upload it here? If it's really that good, we
           ought to have it available directly in our oun NT lib here (BTW
           folks, we will be releasing a new NoiseTracker software library
           soon!)

AFC Eddie  What a Forum!!!

Deanna7332 That sounds great!

AFL JoyceM Gene, do you think it will be possible for synthLAB files to be
           converted to MOD files?

AFL JoyceM MOD files?

AFA Gene   I doubt it, Joyce. The formats are so diametrically opposed in
           their entire basis of their file formats that it wouldn't be
           worth the time for a programmer to develop such a convertor.

Deanna7332 Isn't it possible to move the mod file from the PC forum to our
           music library?

AFA Gene   But..... it might be worth the time for a MIDI File Format to MOD
           convertor, since these two formats are more widely accepted.

Nuzz       they have nothing better to do Gene

ELECTMUSIC Gene.. some interesting similarities with DTune and NTracker

AFA Gene   They lose the file, tho, Deanna. :)

AFL JoyceM In what way, Greg?

ELECTMUSIC Both Prodos 8

Deanna7332 Shhh they won't know a thing :)

ELECTMUSIC I also believe Bill uses a shuttling of sound data between Doc
           Ram and Ram.

AFC Eddie  Interesting, Greg.

ELECTMUSIC Thats how he gets some of the excellent instrument quality

AFC Eddie  But Diversitune has that one distinction:  MIDI input.

AFL JoyceM Deanna, we would greatly appreciate it if you would upload that
           'Pleasure' song to our library :)

ELECTMUSIC Agreed Ed.. one of the factors FTA doesn't like to incorporate
           into their programs.

Deanna7332 I'll u/l it tonight if possible.

AFL JoyceM Thanks :)

AFC Eddie  Thanks, Deanna!

AFL JoyceM I will send Bill B a copy of NoiseTracker + some MOD files...to
           see what comments we get from him (will send when I get back).

AFC DYAJim What ever happened to that diversitune upgrade that was talked
           about ?

ELECTMUSIC That would be interesting Joyce

AFC Eddie  Bill apparently still working on it, Jim.

ELECTMUSIC I am sure he would appreciate the Prodos 8

AFC DYAJim good..

AFL JoyceM Jim...RSN....he was hoping by Christmas (this year), but he is
           soooo busy with his job, who knows?

AFC DYAJim Oh yeah, I noticed the speed calcuation in NT .5 is inaccurate
           :)

AFC DYAJim I recall he has set a lot of Christmas projected dates :)

ELECTMUSIC He was one of the first ""Free Tools"" experts in breaking all the
           rules for economic sake.

AFC DYAJim like for the vaporware DT inst editor like 2 years ago.

Deanna7332 Are there any Christmas Mod or NT songs?

AFC Eddie  Oh yeah, Diversi-Editor!

AFL JoyceM I know, Jim - but that I know he has been working on.

AFC DYAJim he projected Christmas for it, and it never came :)

AFA Gene   Not yet in AMS, but hopefully the Holiday Contest will change all
           that. :)

AFC DYAJim I look foreward to any upgrades..

AFL JoyceM Not that I am aware of Deanna - you have some?  hint, hint

Deanna7332 Nope sorry.  I was hoping there were some that could be u/led
           here

AFC DYAJim I'll be breaking out the xmas tune book rsn.. I should be able to
           midi a few :) (which rules out nt)

AFL JoyceM Question...

AFC Eddie  It would be more appropriate to have a converter from Appleworks
           spreadsheet to MOD than from MIDI!

AFL JoyceM If I got ahold of an Amiga song (MOD) disk...how would I convert
           them for here?

AFA Gene   You mean an Amiga-formatted disk?

AFL JoyceM Yes

AFC DYAJim Ack.. methinks you need an amiga and a null modem cable or a
           modem.

AFA Gene   Methinks Jim is right

AFC DYAJim LOL!!  Design your music in the spreadsheet then import to NT :)
           IT might actually have better editing?!! :)

AFC Eddie  Right!

AFL JoyceM Me thinks he is right.  If I had them upload to me, would that
           work?

AFA Gene   Yep; should work like a charm.

AFC DYAJim Yah.. as long as they're coming from an amiga

AFL JoyceM Great....I will work on that when I get back  (making note now).

AFL JoyceM Gene, will you get some of those files (NT) sent to that area
           tonight?  If so, I will leave the needed message :)

AFA Gene   That's all I have planned for tonight's chat, Joyce. Yep, I'll
           move some files right now.

AFL JoyceM Thanks...

AFL JoyceM Then we should have our NoiseTracker Library by end of the week in
           AMS :)

ELECTMUSIC Gene... quick question:  Are you launching NTracker from a 3.5
           disk?

AFL JoyceM Okay, guys...I will see you all the week of December 11th (may the
           4th) as I am off on vacation.

AFA Gene   Yep greg

AFC JohnC  Where are you going?

ELECTMUSIC Do you encounter out of memory problems

AFL JoyceM Night all...and Gene, thanks for an excellent chat and great
           explanations of NoiseTracker.

Nuzz       Joyce, I have good news for FutureSound owners. SoundConvert will
           support it in the first release

AFC Eddie  Great, Mike!

AFA Gene   Greg, i always keep my RAMdisk at 0 when using noisetracker. Not
           only are

AFC JohnC  Mike...SoundConvert...released?

AFL JoyceM Great, Mike.  When can we get SoundConvert, Mike? and FutureSound
           :)

AFA Gene   there a couple of bugs with memory management, but if you're
           loading in a MOD file that's really big, NT will eat your RAMdisk.

AFC Eddie  Sounds good.

Nuzz       The manual is being ""layout"". Release date should be about 1st
           week of Dec

ELECTMUSIC Tnxs Gene

AFC JohnC  YES.......WTG Nuzz!!!!!!!!

Deanna7332 Yes, why is there on some MOD files a stop somewhere in the middle
           ?

Deanna7332 That's really frustrating!

AFL JoyceM Mike, leave me E-Mail on when and how I can send your the $$ to
           get it.

AFL JoyceM Again...night all

Nuzz       gee John, I had to do something to explain the delay :)

ELECTMUSIC Thanks Gene for a GREAT chat!

AFC Eddie  Yes, Gene!  Great!

AFA Gene   Thanks Greg, 'night!

AFA Gene   thanx, see y'all later :)

Copyright 1987 Bob Szekely.

    John Michael Osbourne, (known as ""Ozzy"" to his fans), has in his long 
career as vocalist for Black Sabbath had his work with the group misconstrued 
as advocating Satanism.  In a 1983 radio special featuring Ozzy, the 
interviewer expressed precisely this point; ""...Ozzy has always been shrouded 
in the darkest of Satanic imagery.  Yet if you really listen to his music, 
you'll find that what he is saying differs greatly from his image....""(1)  Even 
the group's image has often been described as ""occult and diabolic"".(2)

    The important point to remember here is to differentiate between appearance 
and reality.  Although the name ""Black Sabbath"" conjures up images of witches 
and sorcerers paying homage to Satan for the powers bestowed upon them, this 
does not make it safe to assume that the group that went by this name 
necessarily drew the inspiration from the occult.(3)  The closest they ever 
came to it was a gothic horror film featuring Boris Karloff as narrator; they 
adopted their name directly from the name of this film.(4)  Black Sabbath was 
involved in the black arts as much as Karloff practiced casting spells off-
screen.  Tony Iommi, the group's guitarist, summed it up best when he described 
the group as having basically ""...the same appeal as a horror movie.  It's all 
an act.""(5)










    Just as their film counterpart did, Ozzy and Sabbath found the occult 
mythos to be an effective vehicle for powerful social commentary; particularly 
when put in the context of heavy-metal rock and roll.  Ozzy himself noted that 
there are ""...people who pick up my [album] cover[s] and go...'This guy's got 
to be singing about Devil, doom, death and destruction.'  Which is not the 
case....""(6)

    The late Lester Bangs likened the group to Bob Dylan and William Burroughs, 
describing them all as ""...moralists...trying to deal with a serious present 
situation in an honest way....""(7)  Ozzy and Black Sabbath merely bring to 
light the many evils of our world in their work, to try and make us realize 
that we are all victim to their influence.  They hope to make us recognize 
these evils so that we may take up arms against them; a point Ozzy emphatically 
stresses:  ""...one thing everybody has got to understand about Black Sabbath's 
lyrics.  They're not downer lyrics, they're just telling everybody where it's 
at...""(8)  He also cites the group's most controversial tune, ""Black Sabbath"", 
as a response to the ignorant hippie culture still force when the tune was 
written in 1970:  ""The hippies said: 'The world is beautiful man.' (sic)  You 
only had to look around you to see how crappy it was.  It was ridiculous 
listening to that stuff, let alone playing it, so we just wrote about the world 
the way it really was and how it affected us - and we felt better in ourselves 
because we were really being honest....""(9)

        4   YOU JUST STAY IN YOUR GRAVE.
        5   IS GOD JUST A THOUGHT WITHIN YOUR HEAD OR IS
        6   HE A PART OF YOU?

        33  YOU HAD THE CHANCE BUT YOU TURNED IT DOWN
        34  NOW YOU CAN'T RETRIEVE.










    VI  35  PERHAPS YOU'LL THINK BEFORE YOU SAY THAT
        36  GOD IS DEAD AND GONE
        37  OPEN YOUR EYES, JUST REALIZE THAT HE IS THE
        38  ONE.
        39  THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN SAVE YOU KNOW FROM
        40  ALL THIS SIN AND HATE.
        41  OR WILL YOU STILL JEER AT ALL YOU HEAR?
        42  YES!-I THINK IT'S TOO LATE.

    In this piece, the group asserts a belief in an afterlife and spiritual 
redemption.  As grisly as the image of a hanged pontiff is, its shock value is 
a necessary part of the message:  They reject religious dogma, stating that a 
belief in God, in one's own heart, is the only guiding light to help one inn 
his life (lines 11/12, 39/40).  Furthermore, the reject religious hypocrisy 
(lines 5/6, 7/8) and peer pressure (verses III, IV) as excuses for not 
accepting God.  To clarify further:  following the crowd does not justify 
shrugging responsibility for one's own actions.

    After re-reading, it becomes obvious that this song is an ascerbic critique 
of atheism; (line 35/36) I refer here again to verses three and four.  In these 
two verses, the picture painted in one of Godless conformity and how it's 
viewed as being as foolish as Paganism.  These lyrics set an example for the 
listener by relating personal experience (lines 13-16).  However, for those who 
cannot accept this the group has no recourse but to condemn them, although 
rather ironically; they hope that their rhetorical loss of faith in the 
listener will open his eyes (line 42).










                           B L A C K   S A B B A T H 



            WHAT IS THIS, THAT STANDS BEFORE ME?
            FIGURE IN BLACK, WHICH POINTS AT ME
            TURN ROUND QUICK AND START TO RUN
            FIND OUT I'M THE CHOSEN ONE.  OH, NO!
            
            BIG BLACK SHAPE WITH EYES OF FIRE
            TELLING PEOPLE THEIR DESIRE
            SATAN'S SITTING THERE, HE'S SMILING
            WATCHES THOSE FLAMES GET HIGHER AND HIGHER
            OH, NO, NO, -- PLEASE GOD HELP ME!
            
                IS THIS THE END MY FRIEND?
                SATAN'S COMING 'ROUND THE BEND

                THE PEOPLE BETTER GO AND BEWARE
                NO, NO!  PLEASE--NO!!
                
                
    The all time controversy winner!  Is this not irrefutably  THE song about 
Black Magic in rock?  It's all so obvious, suffuse with evil imagery; Satan, 
walls of flame, figure in black, and damnation at the end.  Yes, I see the 
images too; it definitely concerns Black Magic.  Then again, Shakespeare's 
Macbeth employed scenes of witches involved in conjurations; does that mean 
that Shakespeare was a warlock?  Poe used to write sardonic tragedies about 
twisted murderers and the bizarre nature of acts, did that make him an evil, 
leering, demented killer?  Did either of them advocated what they wrote about?  
One has to remember that writing about something is not necessarily the same as 
emulating it.  Tony Iommi spoke out quite strongly about this:  ""People are 
bringing us down saying that we are a Black Magic group.  I think they must be










getting mixed up with Black Widow.  We don't do any sacrifices on stage, and 
we're not on a black magic kick.  We wanted to do heavy numbers and the guitar 
riffs we worked out were more suited to evil things than love.  We play songs 
about black magic, but they are more likely to be against than for it.""(12)  

    By now, you're probably asking yourself who Black Widow is, right?  Then 
it's time for a little history:

        Sabbath, before they were known as Sabbath, had the same line-up but 
two earlier names.  The first one was Polka Tulk, which seemed sure to doom 
them to obscurity.(13)  The soon realized this and changed the group's name to 
Earth.  Now, Earth was a blues band at the end of the English blues boom.  As 
if that wasn't bad enough, they soon discovered that not only was there another 
group named Earth, but they had also released a single.  To avoid confusion, 
they changed their name again.(14)  But what made them decide on that name?  
Just ask Ozzy:  ""I just liked the name Black Sabbath because of the succession 
of vowel sounds.(15)  If that sounds ludicrous just consider this:  Sabbath was 
""...the first of the really committed, loud and heavy bands...""(16)  They 
needed a name to match the gut-wrenching power they were developing.  Tony knew 
that he wanted Sabbath to be noticed above all the rest of the British blues 
bands:  ""We wanted something of our own that we'd like and people would like.  
And we wanted something loud!""










    Tony didn't hate the blues.  He'd cut his teeth as a guitarist on the likes 
of The Shadows, Buddy Holly and Django Rheinhardt, developing his own style 
from there.  But he realized the group had no future in the blues:

        'We couldn't keep playing 12-bars forever.  We just got fed up with 
Earth music.  It was jazz, blues stuff.  It was good for practice but nothing 
else.'

    In the late 'Sixties, blues groups were a dime a dozen in Birmingham and 
interest was waning in the blues boom due to the glut of groups.  One man, by 
the name of Jim Simpson, had heard Earth around the Birmingham club circuit and 
understood what they were trying to do.  He decided to take them under his 
wing.  With the aid of his massive record collection, Jim expanded the group's 
horizons in the areas of jazz and blues.  He introduced them to artists like 
Wes Montgomery, Count Basie and Jimmy Rushing.  It was from Rushing in 
particular that they derived the repetitive riff style so readily noticeable in 
their later incarnation as Black Sabbath.

    The Count Basie influence is evidenced in the song ""Wicked World"" from the 
first album; Sabbath drummer Bill Ward uses a ""'sighing hi-hat'...in the manner 
of Basie's drummer Jo Jones.""










    The influence is subtle, almost subliminal.  Yet it is one which was not 
thought capable of hard, 'heavy' rock bands in the late 'Sixties.  Although Led 
Zeppelin and Jimi Hendrix also had their work steeped in blues and jazz 
derivations (Hendrix' ""Third Stone From the Sun"" and Zeppelin's version of 
Willie Dixon's ""I Can't Quit You Baby"" from their first album), neither was 
able to match the intense energy of Black Sabbath.  Iommi has always had a 
preference for music with an original, distinct style of its' own; as an 
example, he mentions guitarists Joe Pass and Alvin Lee as two of his strongest 
songwriting influences.

    It would also be necessary that Sabbath develop a unique, distinctive style 
and image of their own.  Though they had changed their name from Earth to Black 
Sabbath to avoid confusion with the other Earth; at the same time another group 
emerged by the name of Black Widow ""...who WERE profoundly influenced by the 
occult, had a male witch as a patron, and wrote pieces like ""Come to The 
Sabbat.""  Unfortunately, Sabbath was constantly reaping the benefits of Widow's 
publicity.

    Sabbath was a group that never minced words.  If they saw something as 
destructive, they would be sure to rub the listener's face it it.  They did not 
want their point to be missed.

    With their straightforward, sometimes brutal way of looking at things, they 
try to shock the listener's conscience back into awareness.  The imagery of 
""Hand of Doom"", from the Paranoid album, is candid and condemning; it is a 
strong statement against drug addiction and rightly so...

    Many people felt the group's overall direction was pessimistic and had a 
negative effect on its listener's due to that.  ""Ozzy insisted that if people 
thought he was having a bad effect on the minds of young kids, they should go 
and watch the TV news where real murder and mayhem were a way of life, and 
shown night after night."" (18)

    Sabbath was never negative in their message; they were simply truthful 
about waht they saw as wrong in the world.  If you ""Strip away the horror 
stories, the imagery and the hysteria, (and) turn down the amps a notch...you 
have a well-rehearsed, solid blues and rock band, powered by a dedication to 
well defined objectives.""  On the top of the list of those objectives was 
truth; Sabbath never feared facing that truth squarely, regardless of what many 
people thought of them.

Long, long, time ago,
I can still remember,
When the local calls were ""free"".
And I knew if I paid my bill,
And never wished them any ill,
That the phone company would let me be...

But Uncle Sam said he knew better,
Split 'em up, for all and ever!
We'll foster competition:
It's good capital-ism!

I can't remember if I cried,
When my phone bill first tripled in size.
But something touched me deep inside,
The day... Bell System... died.

And we were singing...

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

Is your office Step by Step,
Or have you gotten some Crossbar yet?
Everybody used to ask...
Oh, is TSPS coming soon?
IDDD will be a boon!
And, I hope to get a Touch-Tone phone, real soon...

The color phones are really neat,
And direct dialing can't be beat!
My area code is ""low"":
The prestige way to go!

Oh, they just raised phone booths to a dime!
Well, I suppose it's about time.
I remember how the payphones chimed,
The day... Bell System... died.

And we were singing...

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

Back then we were all at one rate,
Phone installs didn't cause debate,
About who'd put which wire where...
Installers came right out to you,
No ""phone stores"" with their ballyhoo,
And 411 was free, seemed very fair!

But FCC wanted it seems,
To let others skim long-distance creams,
No matter 'bout the locals,
They're mostly all just yokels!

And so one day it came to pass,
That the great Bell System did collapse,
In rubble now, we all do mass,
The day... Bell System... died.

So bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

I drove on out to Murray Hill,
To see Bell Labs, some time to kill,
But the sign there said the Labs were gone.
I went back to my old CO,
Where I'd had my phone lines, years ago,
But it was empty, dark, and ever so forlorn...

No relays pulsed,
No data crooned,
No MF tones did play their tunes,
There wasn't a word spoken,
All carrier paths were broken...

And so that's how it all occurred,
Microwave horns just nests for birds,
Everything became so absurd,
The day... Bell System... died.

So bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

We were singing:

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?

'Cause she's good enough for me!      With her pagan poetry!

Shall we sing a verse for Venus,    Well the Christians all are humming
Of the Gods she is the meanest,     Cause they say their God is coming,
Cause she bit me on my...elbow      Our God came three times this evening
And it's good enough for me.        And that's good enough for me.

'Til they dumped us in the slammer   Cover subways with inscriptions,
But that's good enough for me        which is good enough for me.....!

One-eyed Odin we will follow      We will pray to Zarathustra
And in fighting we will wallow    And we'll pray just like we usta
Till we wind up in Valhallow      I'm a Zarathustra boosta!
Which is good enough for me!      And that's good enough for me!

Hare Krishna gets a laugh on         I'll arise at early mornin'
When he sees me dressed in saffron   When the Sun gives me the warnin'

But that's good enough for me!       And that's good enough for me!

We will sing a verse for Eris           Of Great Murphy much is spoken
(Golden apples for the fairest!)        For his Law shall not be broken

But she's good enough for me!           Things go wrong for you and me!
 
We will sing for great Diana         If your god of choice is Squat
Who will teach of love and honor     Well then trendy, man, you're not -

'Cause she's tough enough for me!    And that's good enough for me!

We will venerate Bubastis            Call Him God, or call him Allah
'Cause my cat walked up and ast us   The priest will take your dollah

But it's good enough for me!         -wers, but sorry, -not- from me!

I'll sing some songs to Lilith,      Now Danae was sweet as flowers,
Not so young, and not so girlish,    She was into golden showers;
and She's always PMS-ish,            And that showed her Zeus' power
but She's good enough for me!        And that's good enough for me!       
 
And what about this Bacchus,         Diana is a little spikey
Who lives just to raise a ruckus?    And she is a little dyke-ey
Loosens women so they'll f*** us,    You don't have to be a Psych-e
Well, that's good enough for me!     To know that's right for me!

Lilith wears a lacy nightie        That Bob Larson shrieks and hollers
And She is a little flighty        Fighting demons in his callers
She will get you all excite-y      Save his program: SEND YOUR DOLLARS! 
She's wet-dream enough for me!     And that's good enough for me.

              IMPERIUM COMPOUND                                  
                      (Tune: ""Lily the Pink"")

   Now here's a story, a little bit gory,
   A little bit happy, a little bit sad.
   About a drink called Imperium Compound
   And how the SCA's been had!                       (1)

   Chorus: Oh we think, we think, we think,
           The King is a fink, a fink, a fink,
           A figure of respectability
           Rules the Kingdom thru Imperium Compound
           The results are plain to see!

   Duke Treegirtsea, was known for his courtesy,
   And his fighting prowess was well-renowned
   Took a thimble of Imperium Compound
   And the poor Duke nearly drowned!                  (2)

   Words with Andy, you never should bandy
   He is strong enough to kill a moose
   He drinks copious Imperium Compound
   But he can't take Jungle Juice!                    (2)

   Meriwold, he's the bane of a Skald, he
   Has no attributes of which to sing
   Polite and formal, incredibly normal,
   Are you SURE he was the King?                       (3)

   Bearengaer(y) he lived solitary,
   From his presence folks would hide in fear

   There was Astra, no one ever asked her
   And she was for having fun!
   Then she sampled Imperium Compound,
   And today she is a nun   \\ not better!\\               (19)

   There's good old Igor, his prowess is meager
   For he never learned to water-ski!
   But instead he drinks Imperium Compound
   Then he howls and climbs a tree!  \\Hoo Hah!\\          (19)

   Then there's Dagan, his brother's the Ka-Khan,
   Which is quite funny in a King!
   If he gets hooked on Imperium Compound
   There'll be new songs to sing!    \\ Oh, really?\\       (19)  

   Fredrick of Holland, who dwells in the Northland,
   A Master from the West, he came!
   Spends all his money for Imperium Compound
   That's why his garb's always the same!                   (20)

   Now Gyrth Oldcastle, round as a beer barrel,
   Once chose to quarrel with a certain Bard;
   The poet served him with Imperium Compound,
   And left him rendered down to lard!                      (20)

   Many tales abound of Imperium Compound
   And its' strange effects on Royalty,
   But after an hour, this song has no power,
   And by now, it's boring ME!                             (16)

   Duchess Malinda, who doesn't do windas
   But she does a lot of Duchess Things,
   But give her a LOT of Imperium Compound,
   And she sings and sings and sings and sings and sings!   (5)

   AltChorus: Oh it's too long, too long, too long
              To sing the whole song, the song, the song
              Longer than a Royal Court, it is!
              But sing it serial, this ditty Imperial
              And you'll be a bardic whiz!                 (5)

                                             IMPERIUM COMPOUND    
                                             (Atenveldt Verses)

   Now here's a story, a little bit gory,
   A little bit happy, a little bit sad.
   About a drink called Imperium Compound
   And how the SCA's been had!                       

   Chorus: Oh we think, we think, we think,
           The King is a fink, a fink, a fink,
           A figure of respectability
           Rules the Kingdom thru Imperium Compound
           The results are plain to see!

   Mongol Hordemen, those free-living swordsmen
   Subverting the Kingdoms from underneath!
   Have no use for Imperium Compound
   Except perhaps to brush their teeth!

   AltChorus: Oh we fink, we fink, we fink,
              The Khan and the Kink, the Kink, the Kink,
              And the Board, their Great Senilities!
              The Western Irgun, drinks Imperium Compound
              And we're BACK, with results you'll see!    

   Lady Laurel, with Authority Royal,
   Passes and rejects our heraldry
   She needs a swig of Imperium Compound
   Then perhaps she'd deign to talk to me!            

   Lady Trude thought it her duty
   To turn a social wrong into a Right
   Proved her point with Imperium Compound
   And showed that Cheshire Cats can fight!  //and scratch//

   The Board of Directors styled themselves The Electors
   And another con they tried to swing
   Now the BoD drinks Imperium Compound
   So we no longer need a King!                        

   AltChorus: Oh the Bod, the BoD, the BoD,
              It thinks it is God, is God, is God,
              The figure of Supreme Authority!
              And if we O.D.'d on Imperium Compund
              there'd be no need for Royalty!          

   Oh, MEDIEVAL Net, we thought it was all wet
   With witty remarks, and other kinds of sass
   We'll feed our computers on Imperium Compound
   And BYTE the BoD right on its' righteous ass!         

   Good old Duncan was often drunken
   Chasing all the ladies fair
   He bathed himself in Imperium Compound
   Now he has a little savoir faire!                     

                    (more)


  ATEN IMPERIUM (cont.)

   Ioseph of Locksley, never changes his socks, he
   Runs around looking like a Cavalier,
   He stocked up on Imperium Compound
   And he has enough to last for years and years!        

   AltChorus: Oh they forgot, forgot, forgot
              The Locks-e-ly Plot, the Plot, the Plot!
              And it works the best when it is underground!
              It isn't a hassle for a green-and-white tassle
              They're the ones that BREW Imperium Compound!  

   Trelon of the Wood, he was very good, he
   Was a leader that had never been beat before;
   But Caid had Imperium Compound,
   And Imperial Roman Caid won the War!  //with help!//   

   In Tyr Ysgithr, it's regularly whispered there
   That the Kingdom is ruled over by a King    // What's THAT? //
   They're ""democratic"" and quite erratic....
   They've forgot the purpose of the whole damn thing!     

   King Sir Mark von, with his pretty white suit on,
   Rules the Kingdom both with Grace and Purity!
   He never touches Imperium Compound
   At least not where anyone else can see!               

   Duke Sir Deaton, was never beaten
   On the field, or in the drinking hall;
   At the Catbox War with Caid,
   Left thirty bodies piled against the wall!             

   Denis O'Titans was good at smitin'
   A Locksley Monster in every single way!
   Drank a little Imperium Compound
   And ATE Deaton's sword that day  // No! REALLY! //       

   Wotan the Mongoloid, a little bit paranoid,
   But a nice guy none the less;
   Drank a mess of Imperium Compound
   Now he's Justin du Roc, I confess!                       

   Then there's Duke Reynard, with a face like a St. Bernard
   Of the Dukes, he is the homliest
   He tends to toke up on Imperium Compound
   And go out and whomp on anybody's best!                   

   This song'll bedevil the folks at a revel,
   And most of the time it will annoy the King,
   So take a drink of Imperium Compound
   And let's go Royalty-bedeviling!                        

   Duchess Anna is quite a fan-a
   Going on a wartime shopping spree!  \\ War Point!\\
   Took a drink of Imperium Compound
   And shopped so fast we couldn't see! \\ Z-o-o-o-om!\\    (5)

                     (more)


  ATEN IMPERIUM (Cont.)

   Lyn of Whitewolfe, made of the right stuff,
   Twice the Queen of Atenveldt;
   Took a drink of Imperium Compound
   And the Kingdom of Caid before her knelt!              

   Duke Sir Brion, and Duke Sir Trelon,
   Won the Crown with regularity;
   Drank a lot of Imperium Compound,
   And founded a dynasty!                                 

   Stephan von Geist, was most awful nice,
   And a chivalrous fighter without any doubt
   Took a swig of Imperium Compound
   And won the Crown his first time out!                    

   All the Crusadenes were big, but not mean,
   And the finest fighters in the town.
   But they all drank Jerusalem Compound,
   Winning Crown after Crown after Crown!                 

   Good Duke Arthur couldn't get no farth-er
   A Norman King in Aten Land
   Drank too much of Imperium Compound
   And went off to conquer Engel-land!                    

   Then King Richard, a bit of a bitch, heard
   A King's Crown could be done.
   Drank a little Imperium Compound
   And became the Aten King, first one!                    

   Duchess Malinda, who doesn't do windas,
   But she does a lot of Duchess Things,
   But give her a LOT of Imperium Compound,
   And she sings and sings and sings and sings and sings!   

   Duke Sir Brion, with his pretty white suit on,
   Is a model of goodness and purity
   Never touches Imperium Compound
(spoken:) And I'll sell ya seashore property in Yuma, too!  

   Optional last verse:

   Many tales abound of Imperium Compound
   And its' strange effects on Royalty,
   But after an hour, this song has no power,
   And by now, it's boring ME!                            

   AltChorus: Oh it's too long, too long, too long
              To sing the whole song, the song, the song
              Longer than a Royal Court, it is!
              But sing it serial, this ditty Imperial
              And you'll be a bardic whiz!

                recorded: CELTIC CIRCLE DANCE
                          WTP-0002C

        Last night I had the strangest dream in this bleak century
        I dreamed that people the world around believed in Chivalry

        I dreamed I saw a Kingly Crown enshrined in laurel leaves
        with Grace and Joy and Purity attendant at his feet

        I dreamed I saw the perfect Knight receive his accolade
        and minstrels sang and children laughed in some soft forest glade

        I dreamed I saw the finest thing that ever man could make
        grow great and strong and undefiled: Pray God I never wake!

        Last night I had the strangest dream in this bleak century
        I dreamed that people the world around believed in Chivalry

               (to the tune of ""Good King Wenceslaus"")

                Locksley Monsters never yield
                on the field of battle
                strike the helm and bash the shield
                make their eyeteeth rattle
                Bodies on the ground will lie
                bones will burst in sunder
                search for Locksleys' enemies:
                You'll find them six feet under!

                              SONG OF IVANOF

            There is a man who we know well that does the best he can
            but he's displayed in armour made of reticulated garbage cans!

            He looks so fine and fair and strong, oh how he plays the man
            and how it's prized, those galvanized, reticulated garbage cans

            The noblest Roman of them all, a good Praetorian
            a combatant who wears no pants, judst reticulated garbage cans!

            Like old Horatius at the Bridge, like the Legions of Valerian
            (O dearie me: those LOVELY knees!)
            and those reticulated garbage cans!

                         C. McCray Bethancourt

         (sung to the tune (obviously) of the 12 Days of Christmas)


1.           The first time I sent my device, The Heralds said to me

            ""It violates the Rule of Three""

2.           The next time I tried it, the Heralds said to me

            ""We changed the forms, and it violates the Rule of
             Three"".

3.           The third time I tried, and the Heralds said to me, 

            ""We upped the fees, we changed the forms, and it
             violates the Rule of Three"".

4.           Another time I tried and the Heralds said to me,
 
            ""We haven't got it, we upped the fees, we changed the 
             forms, and it violates the Rule of Three"".

5.           The fifth time I tried it, the Heralds said to me,  

            ""In a decision rendered by the College of Arms on
             August 1st, A.S. V it was decided that this style of
             heraldic design was not appropriate to the aims and 
             intentions of the Corporate Body. Holy! Holy! Holy! ""

 note: verse 5 is delivered in an extremely fast, mono-
       tone, similiar to a Gregorian Chant.

           "" ....we haven't got it, we upped the fees, we changed the forms,
             and it violates the Rule of Three.""

6.           I tried it a sixth time, and the Heralds said to me,

            ""We changed the rules, &c""

7.           A seventh time I tried and, the Heralds said to me,

            ""It's against the Rule of Tincture, we changed the
             rules, &c""

8.           I tried it once again and the heralds said to me,

            ""It's not a Period design, It's against the Rule of Tincture, We
             changed the rules, &c""

                                * more *



    Heralds Said To Me (cont.)

9.           I sent it in once more, and the Heralds said to me,

            ""We changed the rules again, It's not a Period design,
             it's against the Rule of Tincture, we changed the
             rules, &c""

10. (sung in cold anger)
             The LAST time I sent my device, the Heralds said to me

    (sung in a state of SMUG)
             ""Someone else has got it, &c""




              (nb: every single one of these reasons has been used by the
              CoA, at one point or another, to reject perfectly good
              heraldry, along with some even MORE stupid.  If the shoe 
              fits....................!!!!!!!!)

                        BUGS ON THE BARONESS
                        Tune: Waltzing Matilda
 
           or: Who was that Vermin I saw you with last, Knight?
   or: There may be Lice on all you Knice, but there ain't no Lice on me

           Once there was a Barony howling in the wilderness
           nestled in the Valley where the River doesn't flow
           and the folks were driven buggy by the insects in the Revel Hall
           Authenticity is wonderful, but this doesn't go!

                   Bugs on the Baroness, bugs on the Baroness!
                   That was the cry that you heard all the day
                   and the scratching can be heard from Ysgithr to Ered Sul
                   why did we come here? Let's go away!

           See them all a scratching, nestled in their armour tight
           the fleas have a melee team that's challenging the field!
           call Truly Nolen! Someone's gotta help us out!
           the crabs are nesting in our helms but we'll never yield!

                   (chorus)

           Dawn comes a-breaking, the bugs have won the Coronet...
           flea-infested Conan-clones in piles upon the lawn
           where is the Barony? The bugs have eaten everyone...
           termites got the stick-jocks, and all their sticks are gone!

                   (chorus)

                          ATENVELDT
                          tune: The West's Awake

                  For all the Lands where I have dwelt
                  Oh Atenveldt, Oh Atenveldt
                  till rivers burn and mountains melt
                  lest I forget my Atenveldt
                  From deserts stark to snow-capped peaks
                  from silent lakes and laughing creeks
                  sing: Oh let man find his heart's ease
                  on rocky plains
                  in desert breeze

                  For oft I thought of mighty men
                  who carved a Land with sword and pen
                  and lit a candle, burning bright,
                  that pierced the darkness; stirred the night!
                  tho some are gone their deeds remain
                  this sunny Crown without a stain
                  sing: Oh, their deeds were not in vain!
                  in sunlit days
                  and falling rain.....

                  So raise your banners, blazoned bright
                  Advance the Dream and Shine the Light!
                  in battle's crash and Revel's song
                  raise high the Flag and wave it long!
                  For all the Lands wherein I've dwelt
                  I love you best, my Atenveldt!
                  Sing: Oh the Joy that I have felt!
                  My Atenveldt
                  My Atenveldt

      What the use of wearing panties
      whalebone corsets of your Auntie's
      boxer shorts and other scanties
      best of all is nude
      there's such fun in going bra-less
      now that it's no longer lawless
      'specially if your figure's flawless
      best of all is nude
      nude is what you're born in
      shirts are never torn in
      underwear and lacy flimsies, garter belts and other whimsies
      yards of itchy cloth to put your form in
      ducks all do it, maidens rue it
      even ancient Picts in Britain blue it
      going naked's how to do it
      best of all is nude!

      If your garters aren't elastic
      tie them up in knots fantastic
      (panty hose is something drastic!)
      best of all is nude!
      If you're tired of wearing clotheses
      shed your garment 'mongst the roses
      never mind the old bluenoses
      best of all is nude!
      Nude is best for ducking!
      Worst for horses bucking!
      Moonlit nights will see such sights
          that are very best for fooling round
                              .....and elbows!
      Nudity is grand to see
       a well-known antidote to virginity
      take your clothes off and you'll see:
      best of all is nude!

                   Hi said the Norn, sittin in the sand
                   once I talked to a great Grey Man
                   spun three times and said with a sigh
                   hadn't been for the Runes had his other eye!

                   Chorus: hi diddle i diddle i day
                           hi diddle i diddle i diddle ay

                   Hi said the Lady, dressed in green
                   prettiest thing I've ever seen
                   she went down underneath the hill
                   and came back out of her own free will

                   Brian Boru, on Irish ground
                   walked three times the Island round
                   Norsemen came lookin for a fight
                   just another Irish Saturday night!

                   Hi said Lugh on the banquest night
                   a poet and a player and a good wheelwright
                   a harper and a warrior and none the least:
                   a Druid and he got in to the Feast!

                   Harold Haardrada's face was red!
                   Came to Britain and he wound up dead
                   Stamford Bridge is where he's found
                   got six feet of English ground

                   the Legion with it's Eagles bright
                   marched into the Pictish night
                   met them there upon the sand
                   gave em up to the Wicker Man!

                   eight-legged steed and hound of Hel
                   the one-eyed Man, he loves ya well
                   fire burn and fire spark
                   are you then feared of the dark?

                   The Circle forms, the Circle flows
                   the Circle goes where no man knows
                   Hail to the Lady, one in three:
                   Present is Past and Past is Me!

                   Rhiannon's Birds are still in flight
                   all thru the Day all thru the Night
                   Hail to the Lady, one in Three
                   Present is Past and Past is Thee!

                   Celtic Circle Dance (cont.)

                   Hi said the Lady dressed in white
                   sang the Day and sang the Night
                   sang the Land and sang the Sea
                   sang the Song, and then sang Me!

                   (extra verses) Salt and oil and mirror bright
                                  fire and fleet and candlelight
                                  by fin and feather, leaf and tree,
                                  fill the cup and blessed be!

                                  From the misty crystal sea
                                  came the Lady to the lea
                                  Sword and Roses in Her Hand
                                  spread their seeds thruout the Land

                                  Came the Stag from oaken wood
                                  saw the Lady where she stood
                                  by the fire burning bright
                                  came to know his heart's delight!

                   (end of extra verses)

                   By Sword and Harp, and Irish Hound
                   Blessed Be: the Day I've found
                   Hail to the Lady, one in Three
                   Present is Past and Past is WE

                   By Oak and Ash and Holy Thorn
                   bledded be the Day you're born!
                   Fire burn and fire bright

               I'll tell you a tale of Peace and Love
                       whack fol the diddle o the di do day
               Of those that Rule all Lands above
                       whack fol the diddle o the di do day
               may Peace, and Plenty be their share
               that keep our Empire in repair
               God save the Directors is our prayer!

                       whack fol the diddle o the di do day

               When we were Sauvage, Fierce and Wilde
               they came as a Mother to her childe
               they gently raised us from the slime
               and kept our hands from Hellishe Crime
               and made us a Kingdom in their own good time

               Now, Atenveldt forgets the Past
               and thinks on a Day that's coming fast
               when we shall all be....civilized....(puke)
               neat, and clean.....and WELL-ADVISED
               oh won't the Directors be....suprised?!

                        tune: They Call the Wind Maria

        Away out here they have a name for even the Ump that's Wuggly

                M'Lady, M'Lady, they call the pigs M'Lady!

        Before I knew M'Lady's name and heard her constant whinin'
        I thought all girls were beautiful and the sun was always shinin'

        Then one day, M'Lady came, and stopped the clocks from tickin'
        she curdled milk, aborted cows, and stopped my stamps from stickin'!

                (chorus)

        Away out here they have a name for everything worth seein'
        but if M'Lady looks at you, then soon you will be fleein'

        M'Lady disappeared one day, and that for sure is scary
        she was the result of experiments by a deranged Vetinary!

                    WEAPONS AT THE DOOR

 Being a Polemic concerning the alleged Custom of the West Kingdom concerning 
 checking your Weapons at the Door of the Revel Hall. As the Satire is the 
 Weapon of the Bard, this said Polemic is to be checked at the Door, along with 
 swords, knives, redheaded Ladies and other such Deadly Things.....

         As I roved out to Western Lands to take the Western Air
         I went into a Revel Hall and I saw a Twelfth Night there
         but I was halted at the gate by a Privy Consellor
                 (that's the man who tells the King of the West how to go to
                  the bath room!)
         who told me I would have to check my Weapons at the door

         As I, in my astonishment, stood hung on tenter-pegs
         a Knight came in whose Prouess hung down between his legs
         the Doorman grabbed a greatsword and he struck the Knight full sore
         and gave him a reciept; he left his weapon at the door!

         a Bard was next whose goodly Voice has entertained us all
         but he, too, was prevented from entering the Hall
         and told he could not carry deadly weapons on the floor
         he left his Voice and Harp among the weapons at the door

         a Master entered graciously, a man we all know well
         who holds a 3rd Dan Black Belt, tho this he'd never tell
         the Master struggled valiantly, the Master cursed and swore
         but he left his hands, and feet, as weapons at the door

         the company was jovial, altho a bit dismayed
         for lack of proper cutlery, down to the smallest blade
         for even teeth and fingernails, each can be used in War
         were cut, and pulled, and left behind, as weapons at the door!

         And has their King not loyal Knights that He must be afraid
         of brawling in his Hall and of Assassin's bloody blade?
         the Rights of Men to carry Arms at least WE'VE not foreswore
         and a POX on them that made the Rule of Weapons at the Door!

                           THE STREETS OF ANN ARBOR

               As I walked out thru the streets of Ann Arbor
               as I walked out thru Ann Arbor one day
               I spied a young Mongol all dressed in white linen
               all dressed in white linen and cold as the clay

               I then spied another, done in on the sidewalk
               along with just about six dozen more
               their wounds were all gaping, from mace and from braoadsword
               from claymore and cannon, all dripping with gore

               what caused this grave carnage, I cried to the Monglos
               oh pray what's the reason for this awful sight
               my answer came slowly from under the corpse-pile
               ""It seems that our bark is much worse than our bite.....""

               the answer continued from pale lips a-shaking
               we sang all our songs and believed them as true
               the Dark Horde could never be beaten in battle
               we thought this was what all good Mongols could do...

               we went down to Atenveldt all for to plunder
               ""too large to defend"" was our song every night
               but Atenveldt's different from East, West or Middle
               there, even the bushes have learned how to bite!

               the Clann stole our ponies, the Scraelings our foodstuffs
               we ran into axes in AtenViking hands
               our maidens ran off with one Richard of Arkham
               and we're all that's left to return to our lands

               MacChluarains and Monsters, Lockehaven and Foxmoor
               that Kingdom is BIG and its' fighters are MEAN!
               we fought and we lost, and fled back to Ann Arbor
               we all came back home with results that you've seen

               keep away from that Land with its' cactus and marshes
               it's no place for Mongols who are bent on War
               they count their blows well, but they strick them yet better
               he crawled into his Yurt, and fell, dead, on the floor.....

                            C. A. Bethancourt III
       tune: the song of the Cowardly Lion, Tin Woodsman and Scarecrow
             in the movie version of the Wizard of Oz

        (Enter the Scarecrow, who singeth:)

        My wife is always nagging; my Prowess it is lagging
        I can't do anything
        she has got a reason, but revenge is out of season
        Oh I wish I could be King!

        If I just had the Crown on, I'd always have a frown on
        and the Barons on a string
        Heads they would be rolling, the Board would be cajoling
        Oh if only I was King!

        I am very fed up with the way this group is set up
        Oh I'd change everything!
        they are so high and mighty with the way that they do fight-ey
        Oh, someday I'll be King!

        Tho my wife is melancholic, and very...vitriolic
        she's a wasp without a sting!
        I'd have to supervise her with a pack of tranquilizers
        If I only was a King......

        (the Tin Woodsman joineth him, and singeth:)

        I grew up kind of cocky, and rather big, and stocky
        and straight as any rod
        on the field I'm a battallion, with the Ladies I'm a stallion
        ...Oh they'd better make me God!

        The other boys are jealous they say I'm over-zealous
        they'd do better to applaud
        the things that I am giving to this Dream that we are living
        oh I wish they'd make me God!

        They say that I'm conceited, but I'm just badly treated
        by people and by BoD
        just think of what they're missing by My Majesty dismissing
        Oh they'd better make me God!

        (the Cowardly Lion creepeth forth, and singeth:)

        Oh I could be a fighter, a great and mighty smiter
        and be the perfect knight
        it's a great and nasty shame, and everyone's to blame
        oh I wish that I could fight!

        Song of the Three (cont.)

        I could be a Cavalier drinking wine and ale and beer
        and be a gorgeous sight
        but it would cost me too much money so it isn't very funny
        oh I wish that I could fight!                               

        Let me at 'em on the field, I would surely make them yield
        to my Power and my Might
        with rattan, shinai and rapier they would nevermore escape here
        If they'd only let me fight

                  That she wore, for the first time, that day.
                  An itsy bitsy teenie weenie little rabbit fur bikini
                  And in her apartment she wanted to stay!

                One day in the Kingdom of the Middle
                It happened at a Tourney one day:
                The Mongols invaded the Middle
                But the Middle did not want to play...

                  (eins - zwei - drei, but the Dark Horde wouldn't die!)

                  It was an itsy bitsy tiny teenie Nauseating Mongol weenie
                  That they saw, for the first time, that day.
                  An itsy bitsy tiny teenie Nauseating Mongol weenie
                  And the Mongols did NOT go away!

                Now the Heralds made up a new Rulebook
                And to read it is some kind of gas!
                It's a bureaucrat's dream, this new Rulebook
                Now NOBODY'S blazon can pass!

                  (Win - Place - Show, tell the Heralds where to go!)

                                 (insert Bronx cheer!)

                  I want an itsy bitsy teenie weenie little rabbit fur bikini
                  On my shield, as my blazon, today!
                  An itsy bitsy teenie weenie little rabbit fur bikini
                  But ""that's offensive"" the Heralds all say!

                I sat down at the Revel last evening
                To a feast of green meat, and Rat Pie...
                It was cold, and disgusting, and greasy
                And I just want to upchuck and die!

                  (6 - 7 - 8, tell them what was on your plate!)

                  It was an itsy bitsy teenie weenie little rabbit fur bikini
                  With a side dish of cold cabbage pie!
                  An itsy bitsy teenie weenie little rabbit fur bikini
                  With the fur on, and NOTHING inside!

                      by William Poundstone
                              1983

     Two mentalities are at work here: 1960s rock fans and 1980s
fundamentalist Christians. The idea of phonographically concealed
messages dates from the Paul McCartney death scare of 1969. For
hard-core types, the secret-message rumors never really died. Avid
rock fans have auditioned ever album release since the late 1960s
for hidden nuances. Backward messages, barely audible messages,
and messages on one stereo track only have been alleged. At the
other end of the sociosensual spectrum, fundamentalist Christians
have gotten into the act. TV programs such as PRAISE THE LORD and
THE 700 CLUB have propagated rumors of a satanic plot in the
recording industry, no less, in which various albums conceal
""backward-masked"" demonic murmurings. If THAT sounds too spacey to
be taken seriously, consider that it was the fundamentalist groups
who were behind House Resolution 6363, a bill introduced in the
U.S. House of Representatives by Robert K. Dornan (R., Calif.) in
1982 to label all suspect records: ""WARNING: THIS RECORD CONTAINS
BACKWARD MASKING THAT MAKES A VERBAL STATEMENT WHICH IS AUDIBLE
WHEN THIS RECORD IS PLAYED BACKWARD AND WHICH MAY BE PERCEPTIBLE
AT A SUBLIMINAL LEVEL WHEN THIS RECORD IS PLAYED FORWARD."" In
February 1983, the Arkansas State Senate passed a similar record-
labeling bill by a vote of 86 to 0.
     Contributing to the quasi-occult status of these rumors is
the difficulty of checking them out on home audio equipment. You
pretty much have to take someone else's word for it, or dismiss
the rumors out of hand.
     From a technical standpoint, there are four simple ways to
conceal a verbal message on a recording. The most obvious is to
record the message at a very low volume. The message may then be
recovered by turning the volume up while playing the record or
tape. If the message is faint enough, though, noise levels of home
equipment may garble it. If the accompanying music or lyrics are
loud enough, or if the message itself is indistinct or
electronically modified, it may be hard to hear on any equipment.
     A second gimmick is to record a message on one stereo track
only. Records and tapes have two independent recordings, of
course, normally played simultaneously for stereo effect. On a
record, each stereo track occupies on one side of the V-shaped
groove for the needle. On a tape, the tracks are recorded in
parallel lanes of the magnetic material. The two tracks are called
""right"" and ""left"" after the stereo speakers they will play on.
Otherwise, the tracks are interchangeable -- the sound mixer can
put anything he or she wants on each track. A message on one track
can be masked by simultaneous loud music or lyrics on the opposite
track. With normal stereo balance (or mono equipment) the loud
track drowns out the message track. At home, single-track messages
can be recovered by adjusting the stereo balance so that only the
desired track plays. Sometimes this trick also makes indistinct
words clearer. Even if the words are not exclusively on one track,
they may happen to be more audible on one track.
     A message could be recorded at a speed different from the
rest of the record. Then the record would have to be played faster
or slower than usual to recover the message. Unless the message
was at one of the standard speeds (say, 45 rpm on a 33 1/3 rpm
record), it could not be played normally on home equipment.
     The fourth and most commonly alleged trick is to record a
verbal message backward. Reversed speech has several unexpected
features. One is that syllables are not a constant in the reversal
process. A one-syllable word can have two or three syllables when
played backward. Thus ""number nine"" in the Beatles' REVOLUTION 9
reverses to ""Turn me on, dead man"" (or something like it), a jump
from three to five syllables.
     There is no simple way to predict what a word or phrase will
sound like reversed. Obviously, you can't just reverse the
letters.
     Reversed messages are difficult to recover at home. Record
turntables are not built to go backwards. Some have a neutral
setting, in which the pickup and amplifier remain active and you
can turn the record backward by hand. But hardly anyone has a
stead enough hand to produce satisfactory results.
     With patience, it is possible to reverse a cassette
recording. Transfer the music from the original record or tape
onto a blank tape cassette. Place the cassette flat on a table.
Draw our the part of the tape with the suspected message and snip
it off at both ends. Hold the tape segment horizontally. Rotate it
180 degrees, keep it horizontal at all times. This turns the tape
end for end. Splice the reversed tape segment back onto the two
loose ends of the cassette with strong adhesive tape. Reel the
tape back inside the cassette. The sliced segment will play
backward on an ordinary cassette player.
     I rented a recording studio to test the secret-message
rumors. New copiies of the records in question were transcribed on
a quarter-inch master tape. Where rumor alleged that a single
stereo track contained a message, right and left stereo tracks
were transcribed separately. Records with alleged inaudible
messages were treated similarly. To test claims of reversed
messages, recordings on the master tape were edited out and
spliced in backward. Twenty cuts or portions of cuts from sixteen
albums were tested.


""Another One Bites the Dust""
Queen, THE GAME

Rumor: When played backward, the lyrics say, ""It's fun to smoke
marijuana.""
Findings: There is something that sounds like ""It's fun to smoke
marijuana"" in the reversed music. It is repeated over and over. It
might be rendered no less faithfully, however, as ""sfun to scout
mare wanna."" This ""message"" is the reversal of the song title,
which is repeated as a line in the song.
     Let's make a distinction between engineered and phonetic
reversals. When an artist records a verbal statement, reverses it
by turning the tape end for end, mixes the reversed statement onto
a master tape, and has records and tapes produced from the master,
that is an engineered reversal. When the phonetic properties of
song lyrics are such that they can be reversed to sound like
something else, that is a phonetic reversal.
     ""It's fun to smoke marijuna"" is clearly a phonetic reversal.
The lyrics are perfectly plain played forward (""Another one bites
the dust""), no so plain played backward (""sfun to scout mare
wanna""). With an engineered reversal, the opposite should hold
true: gibberish forward, clear as a bell backward. Some are
prepared to believe that phonetic reversals are just as
intentional as engineered reversals -- that the songwriter
painstakinginly planned the phonetic double-entendre. In the
absence of confirming evidence, that just doesn't wash. It's too
easy to find coincidences. If, for example, the letters of the
alphabet are recited in conventional fashion (Ay, Bee, Cee, etc.)
and reversed, at least five sound like English language words. D
reverses to ""eden,"" F becomes ""pray,"" S becomes ""say,"" V becomes
""even,"" and Z becomes ""easy."" ""It's fun to smoke marijuana"" is
likewise a coincidence.


""A Child is Coming""
Jefferson Starship, BLOWS AGAINST THE EMPIRE

Rumor: When played backward, ""son of Satan.""
Findings: Another phonetic coincidence. The repeated ""It's getting
better"" reverses to an iffy ""son of Satan,"" the ""of"" drawn out and
the ""Satan"" strongly accented on the first syllable.


""Eldorado""
Electric Light Orchestra, ELDORADO

Rumor: When played backward, ""He is the nasty one/ Christ, you're
infernal/ It is said we're dead men/ Everyone who has the mark
will live.""
Findings: Coincidence. The supposed message lurks around the line
""On a voyage of no return to see."" Reversed, this passage becomes
the expected syllable salad -- no one hearing it would describe it
as anything but reversed music. Only if you listen while reading
along with what you're supposed to hear will you get anything. The
rumored version of the message is somewhat fudged. The passage
sounds more like ""He's to nasty one/ Christ you are, Christ,
you're fernal/ There wiss uh, we're dead men..."" There is no ""in""
in what is taken to be ""infernal."" The line that is supposed to be
""Everyone who has the mark will live"" isn't even close, though the
syllable count is right.


""Shoo Be Doo""
The Cars, CANDY-O

Rumor: When played backward, the word ""Satan"" repeated
approximately eleven times.
Findings: Coincidence. The rumor refers to the reversal of the ""Shoo
be doo, shoo be doo, shoo be doo..."" near the end of the song. Given
the mysterious logic of reversed phonemes, these three-syllable units
can be hard as a repeated two-syllable word. The word sounds a little
like ""Satan.""


""Snowblind""
Styx, PARADISE THEATER

Rumor: According to a mimeographed list of suspect records distributed
by Congressman Dornan, the words ""Satan move through our voices"" when
played backwards.
Findings: Negative. Despite repeated listenings, it was not even
possible to identify the part of the reversed track that Dornan et al.
are talking about.


""Stairway to Heaven""
Led Zeppelin, untitled, a.k.a. STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN

Rumor: In reverse, ""I live for Satan... The Lord turns me off...
There's no escaping it... Here's to my sweet Satan... There's power in
Satan... He will give you 666.""
Findings: Coincidence. If you listen very carefully to the ""And it
makes me wonder"" lines in reverse, you'll hear something approaching
""There's no escaping it."" A better description is ""There's no escape
do."" Knock of the last syllable, and you have ""There's no escape,"" a
complete, intelligible sentence in reverse. It's there, all right, but
it's not an unlikely enough coincidence to -- well, make you wonder.
      The ""Satan"" in ""I live for Satan"" is good and clear. The ""I live
for"" part isn't. The other alleged lines are unremarkable. All are
phonetic reversals of the entirely lucid forward lyrics and obviously
just accidents.


""When Electricity Came to Arkansas""
Black Oak Arkansas, BLACK OAK ARKANSAS and RONCH AND ROLL

Rumor: In reverse, ""Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan. He is God. He
is God.""
Findings: The BLACK OAK ARKANSAS cut was reversed. Again, pairs of
reversed syllables are being freely interpreted as ""Satan."" ""He is
God"" was not identifiable.


""Rain""
The Beatles, HEY JUDE

Rumor: Unintelligible lyrics at the end are reversed.
Findings: A true engineered reversal and not really a secret. ""Rain""
seems to have been the first popular recording to incorporate an
obviously reversed lyric. The story is that John Lennon accidentally
spliced the last part of the song in backward and liked the effect.
When reversed, the strange-sounding vocals at the end become
intelligible as a reprise starting with the drawn-out word
""sunshine.""
      The reversal is less apparent to the casual listener than it
might be because the accompanying music is not reversed. The ending
fits in smoothly with the rest of the song, the vocals suggesting a
foreign language.


""Fire on High""
Electric Light Orchestra, FACE THE MUSIC

Rumor: When played backward, ""The music is reversible, but time --
turn back!""
Findings: ""Fire on High"" is instrumental. About twenty-six seconds
into the music, scrambled speech is heard. It is mostly louder than
the accompanying music and begins with a two-syllable unit repeated
several times. The seeming speech lasts for about fourteen seconds.
      Reversing the music confirms that there is a true, engineered
message. In reverse, a voice (Jeff Lynne's?) says, ""The music is
reversible, but time -- turn back! Turn back! Turn back! Turn back!""
All the words are clear and unambiguous. Anyone comparing this to the
alleged reversal on ELO's ""Eldorado"" will have no trouble telling
which is genuine.


""Goodbye Blue Sky""
Pink Floyd, THE WALL

Rumor: In reverse, ""You have discovered the secret message.""
Findings: The ""secret message"" is at the very end of the instrumental
passage following the ""Goodbye Blue Sky"" vocals. It comes just before
the words ""What shall we do"" at the start of the song that is
identified as ""Empty Spaces"" on the record label and as ""What shall we
do now?"" on the record sleeve. Played forward, the message is less
apparent than the FACE THE MUSIC reversal: A reasonably attentive
listener might play THE WALL through and not catch it. It suggests
speech not quite close enough to be overheard. In context this is not
unusual because the ""Goodbye Blue Sky"" instrumental passage includes
""airport noises"" and other sound effects. A loud climax in the music
further masks the unintelligible voice.
      When played backward, the voice (Roger Waters?) plainly intones,
""Congratulations, you have just discovered the secret message. Please
send your answer to old Pink, care of the funny farm..."" As the voice
fades out, there may be another word -- perhaps ""Chalfonte or
""Chelsea"" -- after ""funny farm.""


""Heavy Metal Poisoning""
Styx, KILROY WAS HERE

Rumor: A red sticker on the KILROY WAS HERE cover warns, ""By order of
the Majority for Musical Morality, this album contains secret backward
messages...""
Findings: This is a case of second-generation backward-masking. Styx'
PARADISE THEATER did not contain a backward message, though a lot of
people said it did. So Styx has included a sure enough backward
message on KILROY WAS HERE. It is at the very beginning of ""Heavy
Metal Poisoning."" The reversed speech last about three seconds. There
is no musical background. The words reverse to ""Annuit coeptis. Novus
ordo seclorum."" This is the Latin motto encircling the pyramid on the
back of a dollar bill. The usual translation: ""God has favored our
undertakings. A new order of the ages.""
      The cover sticker's ""Majority for Musical Morality"" is a
fictitious Falwellesque group in the KILROY WAS HERE video. Although
the sticker suggests a plurality of ""messages,"" only one was found.


Space between ""I'm So Tired"" and ""Blackbird""
The Beatles, untitled, a.k.a. THE WHITE ALBUM

Rumor: A reversed message. At the time of the Paul-is-dead stories,
the segue from ""I'm So Tired"" to ""Blackbird"" was offered as evidence.
It was held to contain John Lennon's voice, reveresed, saying ""Paul is
dead, miss him, miss him, miss him."" That interpretation seems
unlikely now, but there is a mysterious low muttering between the
songs.
Findings: The mumbling is actually just to the ""I'm So Tired"" side of
the shiny ""space"" between cuts on the record. Each of the stereo
tracks was recorded separately, twice, and a copy of each track was
reversed. This produced four versions of the two-second passage: right
forward, left forward, right reversed, and left reversed. All were
equally unintelligible. It was not even apparent whether the voice is
forward or reversed. Nor could John Lennon be identified as the
speaker. There are nine or ten syllables. The first six (when played
forward) are a two-syllable unit repeated three times. There is little
or no difference betwen the stereo tracks. Any claimed interpretation
of the sounds seems doubtful.


""Strawberry Fields Forever""
The Beatles, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR

Rumor: It was, of course, claimed that John Lennon says ""I buried
Paul"" at the end. (It's forward, at the very end after the music
fades to complete silence, returns, and starts to fade out again.)
But Lennon told ROLLING STONE that the words are ""cranberry
sauce.""
Findings: They are ""cranberry sauce."" The ""sauce""/""Paul"" part is
indistinct, but the first syllable sounds a lot more like ""cran""
than ""I.""


""Baby You're a Rich Man""
The Beatles, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR

Rumor: On one of the tracks the line ""Baby you're a rich man too""
is sung as ""Baby you're a rich fag Jew,"" a dig at Brian Epstein.
Or some think it's ""rich fat Jew"" and claim it as evidence of
Beatle anti-Semitism.
Findings: Negative. The two stereo tracks are nearly identical.
It's always possible to hear words as similar-sounding words, but
basically, the lyrics jibe with the published version.


""Revolution 9""
The Beatles, untitled, a.k.a. THE WHITE ALBUM

Rumor: Various reversed and/or one-track speech. The reversal of
""Number nine"" to ""Turn me on, dead man"" has pretty much been
discounted as coincidence (though it appears on Congressman
Dornan's list).
Findings: Distinction between lyrics and any hidden message blurs
on ""Revolution 9."" The eight-minute cut is a montage of sounds
collected by John Lennon and Yoko Ono. It includes discordant
music, radio broadcasts, sirens, applause, gunfights, sports
cheers, the crackling of a fire, screams, a baby gurgling, a choir
singing, and much that cannot be identified. For this
investigation, ""Revolution 9"" was transcribed four times, twice on
each stereo channel. One copy of each of the tracks was reversed.
The four resulting versions were compared with each other and
against the original two-channel version.
     ""Revolution 9"" contains a lot of talking. Played in stereo,
forward, the longest stretch of understandable speech is probably
an announcer saying, ""...every one of them knew that as time went
by they'd get a little bit older and a little bit slower...""
     One believable instance of reversed speech occurs: someone
saying ""Let me out! Let me out!"" (once held to represent McCartney
in his totaled Aston-Martin). Two iffy reversals occur on the
backward recording of the right stereo track:""She used to be
assistant"" and ""There were two men..."" Neither is clear enough or
long enough to be convincing. Some of the music, including the
recurring theme, sounds more natural in reverse.
     ""Turn me on, dead man"" is a typical phonetic reversal. The
forward ""number nine"" (repeated throughout the cut) is clear; the
reversal is slurred -- something like ""turn me on dedmun."" It has
been claimed that ""number nine"" must be pronounced with a British
accent or with some careful inflection in order to reverse to
""Turn me on, dead man."" This seems not to be so. As an experiment,
three American-accent renderings of ""number nine"" were reversed.
All sound about as much like ""Turn me on, dead man"" as the record
did. Like the other phonetic reversals, ""Turn me on, dead man""
must be considered a coincidence.
     Much of ""Revolution 9"" is on one stereo track only. Near the
end a voice says ""A fine natural imbalance...the Watusi...the
twist...Eldorado...Eldorado."" ""A fine natural imbalance"" is on the
right track only, though the words that follow are in stereo. One
of the longer bits of speech -- ""Who could tell what he was
saying? His voice was low and his [unintelligible] was high and
his eyes were low"" -- is clear on the left track, a bare whisper
on the right.
     There is a stereophonically concealed ""secret message"" on
""Revolution 9."" The words are on the right track. They begin about
four minutes, fifty-eight seconds into the cut and run for about
twenty-two seconds. They are not likely to be noticed in stereo
because of the much louder left track. The sound of applause
begins on the left track at about five minutes, one second into
the cut. Deafening noises -- the clapping, sirens, music --
continue on the left track until five minutes, forty seconds. It
may or may not have been Lennon's and Ono's intention to conceal
the spoken passage. Given the haphazard quality of ""Revolution 9,""
the concealment may have been accidental. To recover the passage,
the left track must be switched off. The right track can then be
heard to contain a sound like a stopwatch ticking, behind these
words:

     So the wife called, and we better go to see a
     surgeon....[A SCREAM MUFFLES A LINE THAT SOUNDS LIKE
     Well, what with the prices, the prices have snowballed,
     no wonder it's closed.] ...So any and all, we went to
     see the dentist instead, who gave him a pair of teeth,
     which wasn't any good at all. So instead of that he
     joined the bloody navy and went to sea.
                      by William Poundstone
                              1986

     There really are backward messages on rock albums. And the
controversy over ""backward masking"" and ""porn rock"" has inspired a
whole new spate of messages. There may have been more genuine
backward messages in the past few years than ever before.
     The backward message controversy is usually traced to the
1960s and John Lennon's avant-garde sound mixing on such tracks as
""Revolution 9"" on the Beatles' WHITE ALBUM. Lennon probably wasn't
trying to conceal a message so much as create an interesting
sound.
     The matter might have ended right there had it not been for
the Paul McCartney death rumor. College kids tried playing Beatles
records forward, backward, and at various speeds to find ""clues""
to McCartney's fate. In the process they found snippets of speech
from Lennon's experiments. Even after McCartney was found safe and
sound in Scotland, some listeners continued to look for hidden
messages.
     Somehow, fundamentalist Christian groups became convinced
(ca. 1982) that the alleged messages were commercials for devil
worship. Not a single indisputable satanic message has turned up,
but there were scattered attempts to ban or label certain albums.
In 1986 one fundamentalist group announced that the theme song for
the old MR. ED TV show contains the word ""Satan"" when played
backward.)
     Ironically, the publicity accorded nonexistent messages has
inspired several artists -- among them porn rock hearing witness
Frank Zappa -- to hide real background messages in their music.
It's easy to do.
     The performer speaks or sings the message normally, then
reverses the tape, which is mixed into the soundtrack. This is all
accomplished simply enough at any recording studio.
     What's not so simple is playing it back. More home record,
cassette, and compact disk players won't play backward. You can
turn a record backward with a pencil eraser, but it's not good for
the needle or the turntable. The only way to reproduce the message
with full fidelity is to use a professional-quality reel-to-reel
tape player and splice the tape in backward.
     We used the facilities of KLOS radio in Los Angeles to
reverse some recent records containing true backward messages.


""Secret Messages""
Electric Light Orchestra, SECRET MESSAGES

ELO's ELDORADO album was among those alleged to contain satanic
backward masked messages. A patient listening to ELDORADO played
backward reveals no such messages. You hear only what you ought to
hear -- the reversed lyrics of the songs, which sound nothing like
the ""messages"" claimed to be there. In the wake of such
allegations, ELO did put an (innocuous) backward message on their
FACE THE MUSIC album. Perhaps they thought this would show how
silly the allegations were. Instead, the backward-masking people
seized on this as proof that the other ""messages"" were real. In
the latest volley, ELO has named an album after the controversy.
     In Britain (where the backward-masking issue is viewed as an
American eccentricity), the cover of SECRET MESSAGES has a mock
warning label to youth about the hidden label. Word of the albums'
impending release in the United States caused enough of a furor to
chill CBS Records into deleting the cover blurb.
     The reversed message is easy to find. It's at the beginning
of the first song, which is itself called ""Secret Messages."" You
can hear reversed speech when you play the record normally. A
voice intones ""secret messages"" -- forward -- in the middle of the
reversed speech, lest anyone dare be so unhip as to not know
what's going on.
     We transferred a new copy of SECRET MESSAGES to reel-to-reel
tapes and played it backward. The backward message goes: ""WELCOME
TO THE BIG SHOW/ WELCOME TO THE BIG SHOW.""
     That's it.


""Ya Hozna""
Frank Zappa, THEM OR US

""Ya Hozna,"" a six-minute composition on the first record of the
THEM OR US double album, is ENTIRELY backward. The albums' inner
cover, which includes lyrics for the other songs, says, ""backwards
vocal -- you figure it out"" of this cut. It credits Frank and Moon
Zappa, George Duke, and Napoleon Murphy Brock as vocalists.
     Played forward, ""Ya Howza"" sounds like a record played
backward -- reasonably so. The vocals are prominent and
unintelligible. Moon Zappa's voice is curiously recognizable, even
in reverse. It is hard to tell whether the music was recorded
forward or backward.
     When ""Ya Howza"" is played in reverse, you discover that the
music is virtually a palindrome -- it sounds about the same
forward and backward. The voices are all backward. In some cases
they have been modified electronically. Many of the words are
muffled. Even after repeated careful listening on both stereo
tracks, it is difficult to make out many of the lyrics. It doesn't
help that some of the words seem to be stream-of-consciousness
nonsense. Some of the unintelligible stuff sounds like opera.
     Starting at the beginning of the reversed tape -- the end of
the forward tape -- the clearer vocals go like this: ""I am the
heaven, I am the water."" This is in a hymnlike register. ""You are
a lonely little girl./ But your mommy and your daddy hold you."" A
singsong synthesizer voice.
     The most interesting part of the lyrics is an intermittently
orgasmic rap in Moon Zappa's Valley Girl voice. There are three
short monologues:

I'm like green!
I'm like squat!
I'm like soul!
Repeat, like soul!
I'm like pull, push,
Okay, like slow, slow.

You're never too old
Like slow, like slow, like slow
Okay, I like it.


All right, faster, faster,
Go, do it, do it twice,
Yeah, that feels good,
I'm looking great,
Yeah, fer shure!
Like, no way!


""No Anchovies, Please""
J. Geils Band, LOVE STINKS

""No Anchovies, Please"" is a novelty song, really a narration with
sound effects, about a woman who is kidnapped after eating
anchovies. She is taken to a ""foreign-speaking"" country. The sound
effect of the foreign tongue seems reversed. When you do play it
in reverse, it becomes: ""It doesn't take a genius to know the
difference between chicken shit and chicken salad.""


""Darling Nikki""
Prince, PURPLE RAIN

""Darling Nikki,"" cited as porn rock before Congress, is about a
dominatrix in a hotel lobby masturbating with a magazine. In part,
the complaint was that the album cover (flowers, and Prince on a
motorcycle) wasn't explicit enough to warn kids of the suggestive
lyrics. Senator Paula Hawkins apparently was not aware of a
backward message hidden in ""Darling Nikki."" The last thirty-five
seconds of the song is gibberish. The music changes abruptly and
becomes a repeated glottal sound. Then a two-syllable sound is
repeated twice, something like ""heaven, heaven."" Unintelligible
speech follows. At the end is a sound reminiscent of rain or bacon
frying , and wind sounds.
     Played backward, the message becomes:

     Hello, how are you?
     I'm fine 'cause I know that the Lord is coming soon.
     Coming, coming soon.

     It is clearly Prince and the Revolution singing this. The
words are clear but the intonation is funny -- the linger on some
words. Perhaps this is to make the reversed message you hear
playing the record normally a little less conspicuous.
     This is a weird reversal of the supposed secret message
menace. Raunchy forward lyrics conceal a religious secret message.


""Judas Kiss""
Petra, MORE POWER TO YOU

Petra is an obscure group that sings religious songs to a rock
beat. As further proof that things have gone full circle, the
backward-masking controversy prompted Petra to include a wholesome
backward message on their MORE POWER TO YOU album. It is in the
transition between two songs, just before ""Judas Kiss."" Clearly
audible gibberish reverses to this (the husky voice a cross
between George Beverly Shea and Dee Snider): ""What are you looking
for the Devil for, when you ought to be looking for the Lord?""

AFL JoyceM Welcome to the Apple II Music & Sound chat - our discussion will
           be on NoiseTracker - the new FTA music program for the GS.  AFA
           Gene will be our host this evening...Gene, the floor is yours :)

AFA Gene   Hi all... well first I'd like to point out, if y'all aren't aware
           yet, that a spanking new version of NoiseTracker has recently
           been released (9 days ago) and is now available in our New Files
           library. It is version 0.5. I haven't played around with it much
           yet, but it's supposed to fix a lot of the little bugs in 0.3
           (the first version we had online).  NoiseTracker also includes
           the ability to directly import ""modules,"" a term used for a
           certain type of Amiga song file which has become popular among PC
           users using the SoundBlaster sound card.

           Now, via NT, these ""MOD"" files are accessible by the GS. We
           expect to see a lot of activity on this end as far as ports from
           the PC and Amiga go. Note that you should be able to go straight
           to the PC music forum and download any recently uploaded MOD
           songfiles (there was a bug in the first wide release of the PCAO
           software, however, so a bunch of files with dates between around
           March 1991 and September 1991 may not download properly. Note that
           to use these PC MOD files, you'll have to rename the downloaded
           file ""MOD.xxxxxx"" if you want it to show up automatically in NT's
           ""open"" dialog box. (On the PC, all MOD files are named
           ""xxxxxxxx.MOD"" instead.)   Also, if the files are packed with ZIP
           compression, you'll need a program from the Communications Forum
           called AGATE -- it's a terminal program that includes the ability
           to unpack ZIP files.

           Now, I guess the best thing to do would be to talk about our
           favorite songfiles... there have been a few complaints, in fact,
           that people were not being ""descriptive"" enough in their file
           descriptions for uploads in describing the songs.

AFC Eddie  ?

AFA Gene   GA ed

AFC Eddie  Once a MOD file is unpacked with Agate, is a file type change
           needed?

AFA Gene   Nope, since all that NT looks for is the ""MOD."" being the first
           four characters in the filename.

AFC Eddie  OK, Thanks!

Deanna7332 Question...

JonL7      Can you list some of the features of Noisetracker?

AFA Gene   (you don't even need that ""MOD."" if you want to type the name in
           directly.)

Deanna7332 Did any of these mod files have anything to do with FTA's ""Module
           A""

AFA Gene   Sure Jon, right after we answer Deanna's question. Deanna, you
           mean ""Modulae?""

Deanna7332 Yes, that's it.

AFA Gene   Modulae was a demo written by FTA last year. (i'll get to you in a
           sec Doors).  It used SoundSmith v0.95 for all it's music. There
           is no connection between MOD files and Modulae by FTA.

Deanna7332 Throughout the demo it said ""Loading modules""

AFA Gene   Those ""modules"" are not the same as Amiga soundfile ""modules"" --
           you see, what Modulae really was was a ""stringing together"" of a
           bunch of neat little tiny demos that FTA had written. So they
           called each little demo a ""module"" and thus the entire demo as a
           whole, ""Modulae"" (fancy plural of module?)

Deanna7332 Ok I understand.  Thank you. :)

AFL JoyceM Latin, Gene :)

AFA Gene   The term ""MODule"" from the Amiga comes from the idea that all the
           stuff needed to play the songfile (all the instruments + the
           sequence file) are included into one file, the ""module.""

TheDoors1  Gene, I have tried to d/l some recent uploaded MODs in the PC
           music area and still the problem exists.

AFA Gene   As I understand it, the problem was fixed VERY recently (correct
           me on this Joyce) and files uploaded as recently as early
           November still might not work depending on the version of the
           PCAO software that the uploader used.

AFL JoyceM Actually, Gene...I was under the impression that it had been, but
           if Doors is still having a problem, then it must not be fixed.

AFA Gene   What date was the file you tried to d/l, Door?

TheDoors1  umm 11/17, around there

AFA Gene   hmmm.... well i can tell you one thing... if it didn't work, don't
           waste your time again later... the problem is in the Apple
           software's method of d/lling files, and there are no plans to
           upgrade the Apple AO software.

AFL JoyceM I will endeavor to get an answer to that PC downloading
           problem/question :)

ThomasK63  i have a quick question... what can you use to unpack amiga mod
           files? On the PC side, that is.

TheDoors1  Agate Thomas

ELECTMUSIC Doors... what happens on after downloading..

Deanna7332 If it's LZHed you can't unless you have an IBM or
           PC/Transporter.

AFA Gene   If GS-ShrinkIt doesn't have that ability, i don't think there
           exists any such utility on the GS.

TheDoors1  What do you mean Elect?

ELECTMUSIC After you download the file... where do you encounter a problem?

TheDoors1  ok, you know when you download the file and at some point in the
           download the file starts to appear on your screen.  That's when I
           cancel it.

ThomasK63  I am sure soething good can be made w/out resorting to Amiga
           files

AFC Eddie  Yes, Doors, I believe the problem is with the PC software it was
           UL'd with.

TheDoors1  yeah Eddie.

GNO Tim    Amiga MOD files are typically compressed using LHarc.  I've
           uncompressed several on my Unix machine at school.

ThomasK63  good time for someone to make a lharc unpacker...

AFC DYAJim someone might be ;)

GNO Tim    Several people are already

AFC Eddie  Can't wait, Jim!

AFA Gene   Jon, did you have a question?

JonL7      The features of Noisetracker :)

AFA Gene   Oh yes... okay, here goes, in a nutshell, from most important to
           least:


AFA Gene   *  ability to import MOD files

           *  ability to import Soundsmith files

           *  ProDOS 8 based

           *  virtually no editing abilities (not a feature but important to
           know)

AFC DYAJim :)

AFA Gene   *  forgot: and the most important feature of all, the ability to
           hold instrument files in regular system RAM instead of DOC RAM,
           allowing for instruments far beyond the regular 64K limit found
           in ALL other GS music programs.

ThomasK63  I'll buy that!

TheDoors1  I have another question...when you're ready.

AFA Gene   GA Doors

TheDoors1  ok..is it true that NoiseTracker will take in soundsmith files and
           play them more clearly

AFA Gene   Well, as far as ""what you hear,"" yes there is a definite
           difference with some instruments. It does NOT play the sounds
           more ""clearly,"" but it just plays them in a different way. What
           many people seem to like about this ""different way"" is that
           sustained instruments (i.e. instruments designed to be played
           in a loop to simulate a long held note) seem to work better (or
           perhaps simply the way they were originally intended to work).

TheDoors1  I see

Deanna7332 Which takes up more space - MOD or NT  w/soundfile ?

AFA Gene   Deanna, it depends a few things, such as how big the sequence is,
           how many instruments you have, etc. Once you have a lot of
           assorted files, it'll probably average out to be about the same
           give or take a hundred blocks on your HD. So it basically depends
           on whether you prefer to have your instruments separate or not.

Deanna7332 Does playing quality differ with either one ?

AFA Gene   Nope. It's exactly the same either way. Loading time is the same
           too.

AFC Eddie  Can NT save songs as MOD files?

AFA Gene   Nope. It has options for Open and Close module, but these are
           still inactive.

AFA Gene   If there are no more questions, I'd like to talk about which NT
           files out there are the ""hottest,"" since this info could be
           useful to many users who are interested in downloading NT/MOD
           files.

           My personal favorite is ""Lambada,"" which is supplied by FTA with
           the program but is available separately on America
           Online.Everything about this file is really impressive except
           perhaps the sound quality of the horn-ish melody instrument.

           What about y'all, what are your favorite NT files?

AFL JoyceM Gene, there is a classical song for NT, but can't remember the
           name, but it is good.

AFC Eddie  I like Dragnet!

ELECTMUSIC So do I Ed

TheDoors1  I like Seven something

Deanna7332 My most favorite of all mod files is Pleasure Principle

AFC Eddie  <--appreciate's Greg's taste!

AFL JoyceM :)

AFA Gene   Deanna, i assume you got that from a local board?

Deanna7332 I got it from the PC forum here.

TheDoors1  I saw it there also

Deanna7332 I think under ""Pleasure""

AFA Gene   Would you be able to upload it here? If it's really that good, we
           ought to have it available directly in our oun NT lib here (BTW
           folks, we will be releasing a new NoiseTracker software library
           soon!)

AFC Eddie  What a Forum!!!

Deanna7332 That sounds great!

AFL JoyceM Gene, do you think it will be possible for synthLAB files to be
           converted to MOD files?

AFL JoyceM MOD files?

AFA Gene   I doubt it, Joyce. The formats are so diametrically opposed in
           their entire basis of their file formats that it wouldn't be
           worth the time for a programmer to develop such a convertor.

Deanna7332 Isn't it possible to move the mod file from the PC forum to our
           music library?

AFA Gene   But..... it might be worth the time for a MIDI File Format to MOD
           convertor, since these two formats are more widely accepted.

Nuzz       they have nothing better to do Gene

ELECTMUSIC Gene.. some interesting similarities with DTune and NTracker

AFA Gene   They lose the file, tho, Deanna. :)

AFL JoyceM In what way, Greg?

ELECTMUSIC Both Prodos 8

Deanna7332 Shhh they won't know a thing :)

ELECTMUSIC I also believe Bill uses a shuttling of sound data between Doc
           Ram and Ram.

AFC Eddie  Interesting, Greg.

ELECTMUSIC Thats how he gets some of the excellent instrument quality

AFC Eddie  But Diversitune has that one distinction:  MIDI input.

AFL JoyceM Deanna, we would greatly appreciate it if you would upload that
           'Pleasure' song to our library :)

ELECTMUSIC Agreed Ed.. one of the factors FTA doesn't like to incorporate
           into their programs.

Deanna7332 I'll u/l it tonight if possible.

AFL JoyceM Thanks :)

AFC Eddie  Thanks, Deanna!

AFL JoyceM I will send Bill B a copy of NoiseTracker + some MOD files...to
           see what comments we get from him (will send when I get back).

AFC DYAJim What ever happened to that diversitune upgrade that was talked
           about ?

ELECTMUSIC That would be interesting Joyce

AFC Eddie  Bill apparently still working on it, Jim.

ELECTMUSIC I am sure he would appreciate the Prodos 8

AFC DYAJim good..

AFL JoyceM Jim...RSN....he was hoping by Christmas (this year), but he is
           soooo busy with his job, who knows?

AFC DYAJim Oh yeah, I noticed the speed calcuation in NT .5 is inaccurate
           :)

AFC DYAJim I recall he has set a lot of Christmas projected dates :)

ELECTMUSIC He was one of the first ""Free Tools"" experts in breaking all the
           rules for economic sake.

AFC DYAJim like for the vaporware DT inst editor like 2 years ago.

Deanna7332 Are there any Christmas Mod or NT songs?

AFC Eddie  Oh yeah, Diversi-Editor!

AFL JoyceM I know, Jim - but that I know he has been working on.

AFC DYAJim he projected Christmas for it, and it never came :)

AFA Gene   Not yet in AMS, but hopefully the Holiday Contest will change all
           that. :)

AFC DYAJim I look foreward to any upgrades..

AFL JoyceM Not that I am aware of Deanna - you have some?  hint, hint

Deanna7332 Nope sorry.  I was hoping there were some that could be u/led
           here

AFC DYAJim I'll be breaking out the xmas tune book rsn.. I should be able to
           midi a few :) (which rules out nt)

AFL JoyceM Question...

AFC Eddie  It would be more appropriate to have a converter from Appleworks
           spreadsheet to MOD than from MIDI!

AFL JoyceM If I got ahold of an Amiga song (MOD) disk...how would I convert
           them for here?

AFA Gene   You mean an Amiga-formatted disk?

AFL JoyceM Yes

AFC DYAJim Ack.. methinks you need an amiga and a null modem cable or a
           modem.

AFA Gene   Methinks Jim is right

AFC DYAJim LOL!!  Design your music in the spreadsheet then import to NT :)
           IT might actually have better editing?!! :)

AFC Eddie  Right!

AFL JoyceM Me thinks he is right.  If I had them upload to me, would that
           work?

AFA Gene   Yep; should work like a charm.

AFC DYAJim Yah.. as long as they're coming from an amiga

AFL JoyceM Great....I will work on that when I get back  (making note now).

AFL JoyceM Gene, will you get some of those files (NT) sent to that area
           tonight?  If so, I will leave the needed message :)

AFA Gene   That's all I have planned for tonight's chat, Joyce. Yep, I'll
           move some files right now.

AFL JoyceM Thanks...

AFL JoyceM Then we should have our NoiseTracker Library by end of the week in
           AMS :)

ELECTMUSIC Gene... quick question:  Are you launching NTracker from a 3.5
           disk?

AFL JoyceM Okay, guys...I will see you all the week of December 11th (may the
           4th) as I am off on vacation.

AFA Gene   Yep greg

AFC JohnC  Where are you going?

ELECTMUSIC Do you encounter out of memory problems

AFL JoyceM Night all...and Gene, thanks for an excellent chat and great
           explanations of NoiseTracker.

Nuzz       Joyce, I have good news for FutureSound owners. SoundConvert will
           support it in the first release

AFC Eddie  Great, Mike!

AFA Gene   Greg, i always keep my RAMdisk at 0 when using noisetracker. Not
           only are

AFC JohnC  Mike...SoundConvert...released?

AFL JoyceM Great, Mike.  When can we get SoundConvert, Mike? and FutureSound
           :)

AFA Gene   there a couple of bugs with memory management, but if you're
           loading in a MOD file that's really big, NT will eat your RAMdisk.

AFC Eddie  Sounds good.

Nuzz       The manual is being ""layout"". Release date should be about 1st
           week of Dec

ELECTMUSIC Tnxs Gene

AFC JohnC  YES.......WTG Nuzz!!!!!!!!

Deanna7332 Yes, why is there on some MOD files a stop somewhere in the middle
           ?

Deanna7332 That's really frustrating!

AFL JoyceM Mike, leave me E-Mail on when and how I can send your the $$ to
           get it.

AFL JoyceM Again...night all

Nuzz       gee John, I had to do something to explain the delay :)

ELECTMUSIC Thanks Gene for a GREAT chat!

AFC Eddie  Yes, Gene!  Great!

AFA Gene   Thanks Greg, 'night!

AFA Gene   thanx, see y'all later :)

Copyright 1987 Bob Szekely.

    John Michael Osbourne, (known as ""Ozzy"" to his fans), has in his long 
career as vocalist for Black Sabbath had his work with the group misconstrued 
as advocating Satanism.  In a 1983 radio special featuring Ozzy, the 
interviewer expressed precisely this point; ""...Ozzy has always been shrouded 
in the darkest of Satanic imagery.  Yet if you really listen to his music, 
you'll find that what he is saying differs greatly from his image....""(1)  Even 
the group's image has often been described as ""occult and diabolic"".(2)

    The important point to remember here is to differentiate between appearance 
and reality.  Although the name ""Black Sabbath"" conjures up images of witches 
and sorcerers paying homage to Satan for the powers bestowed upon them, this 
does not make it safe to assume that the group that went by this name 
necessarily drew the inspiration from the occult.(3)  The closest they ever 
came to it was a gothic horror film featuring Boris Karloff as narrator; they 
adopted their name directly from the name of this film.(4)  Black Sabbath was 
involved in the black arts as much as Karloff practiced casting spells off-
screen.  Tony Iommi, the group's guitarist, summed it up best when he described 
the group as having basically ""...the same appeal as a horror movie.  It's all 
an act.""(5)










    Just as their film counterpart did, Ozzy and Sabbath found the occult 
mythos to be an effective vehicle for powerful social commentary; particularly 
when put in the context of heavy-metal rock and roll.  Ozzy himself noted that 
there are ""...people who pick up my [album] cover[s] and go...'This guy's got 
to be singing about Devil, doom, death and destruction.'  Which is not the 
case....""(6)

    The late Lester Bangs likened the group to Bob Dylan and William Burroughs, 
describing them all as ""...moralists...trying to deal with a serious present 
situation in an honest way....""(7)  Ozzy and Black Sabbath merely bring to 
light the many evils of our world in their work, to try and make us realize 
that we are all victim to their influence.  They hope to make us recognize 
these evils so that we may take up arms against them; a point Ozzy emphatically 
stresses:  ""...one thing everybody has got to understand about Black Sabbath's 
lyrics.  They're not downer lyrics, they're just telling everybody where it's 
at...""(8)  He also cites the group's most controversial tune, ""Black Sabbath"", 
as a response to the ignorant hippie culture still force when the tune was 
written in 1970:  ""The hippies said: 'The world is beautiful man.' (sic)  You 
only had to look around you to see how crappy it was.  It was ridiculous 
listening to that stuff, let alone playing it, so we just wrote about the world 
the way it really was and how it affected us - and we felt better in ourselves 
because we were really being honest....""(9)

        33  YOU HAD THE CHANCE BUT YOU TURNED IT DOWN
        34  NOW YOU CAN'T RETRIEVE.










    VI  35  PERHAPS YOU'LL THINK BEFORE YOU SAY THAT
        36  GOD IS DEAD AND GONE
        37  OPEN YOUR EYES, JUST REALIZE THAT HE IS THE
        38  ONE.
        39  THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN SAVE YOU KNOW FROM
        40  ALL THIS SIN AND HATE.
        41  OR WILL YOU STILL JEER AT ALL YOU HEAR?
        42  YES!-I THINK IT'S TOO LATE.

    In this piece, the group asserts a belief in an afterlife and spiritual 
redemption.  As grisly as the image of a hanged pontiff is, its shock value is 
a necessary part of the message:  They reject religious dogma, stating that a 
belief in God, in one's own heart, is the only guiding light to help one inn 
his life (lines 11/12, 39/40).  Furthermore, the reject religious hypocrisy 
(lines 5/6, 7/8) and peer pressure (verses III, IV) as excuses for not 
accepting God.  To clarify further:  following the crowd does not justify 
shrugging responsibility for one's own actions.

    After re-reading, it becomes obvious that this song is an ascerbic critique 
of atheism; (line 35/36) I refer here again to verses three and four.  In these 
two verses, the picture painted in one of Godless conformity and how it's 
viewed as being as foolish as Paganism.  These lyrics set an example for the 
listener by relating personal experience (lines 13-16).  However, for those who 
cannot accept this the group has no recourse but to condemn them, although 
rather ironically; they hope that their rhetorical loss of faith in the 
listener will open his eyes (line 42).

            WHAT IS THIS, THAT STANDS BEFORE ME?
            FIGURE IN BLACK, WHICH POINTS AT ME
            TURN ROUND QUICK AND START TO RUN
            FIND OUT I'M THE CHOSEN ONE.  OH, NO!
            
            BIG BLACK SHAPE WITH EYES OF FIRE
            TELLING PEOPLE THEIR DESIRE
            SATAN'S SITTING THERE, HE'S SMILING
            WATCHES THOSE FLAMES GET HIGHER AND HIGHER
            OH, NO, NO, -- PLEASE GOD HELP ME!
            
                IS THIS THE END MY FRIEND?
                SATAN'S COMING 'ROUND THE BEND
                PEOPLE RUNNING 'CAUSE THEY'RE SCARED
                THE PEOPLE BETTER GO AND BEWARE
                NO, NO!  PLEASE--NO!!
                
                
    The all time controversy winner!  Is this not irrefutably  THE song about 
Black Magic in rock?  It's all so obvious, suffuse with evil imagery; Satan, 
walls of flame, figure in black, and damnation at the end.  Yes, I see the 
images too; it definitely concerns Black Magic.  Then again, Shakespeare's 
Macbeth employed scenes of witches involved in conjurations; does that mean 
that Shakespeare was a warlock?  Poe used to write sardonic tragedies about 
twisted murderers and the bizarre nature of acts, did that make him an evil, 
leering, demented killer?  Did either of them advocated what they wrote about?  
One has to remember that writing about something is not necessarily the same as 
emulating it.  Tony Iommi spoke out quite strongly about this:  ""People are 
bringing us down saying that we are a Black Magic group.  I think they must be










getting mixed up with Black Widow.  We don't do any sacrifices on stage, and 
we're not on a black magic kick.  We wanted to do heavy numbers and the guitar 
riffs we worked out were more suited to evil things than love.  We play songs 
about black magic, but they are more likely to be against than for it.""(12)  

    By now, you're probably asking yourself who Black Widow is, right?  Then 
it's time for a little history:

        Sabbath, before they were known as Sabbath, had the same line-up but 
two earlier names.  The first one was Polka Tulk, which seemed sure to doom 
them to obscurity.(13)  The soon realized this and changed the group's name to 
Earth.  Now, Earth was a blues band at the end of the English blues boom.  As 
if that wasn't bad enough, they soon discovered that not only was there another 
group named Earth, but they had also released a single.  To avoid confusion, 
they changed their name again.(14)  But what made them decide on that name?  
Just ask Ozzy:  ""I just liked the name Black Sabbath because of the succession 
of vowel sounds.(15)  If that sounds ludicrous just consider this:  Sabbath was 
""...the first of the really committed, loud and heavy bands...""(16)  They 
needed a name to match the gut-wrenching power they were developing.  Tony knew 
that he wanted Sabbath to be noticed above all the rest of the British blues 
bands:  ""We wanted something of our own that we'd like and people would like.  
And we wanted something loud!""










    Tony didn't hate the blues.  He'd cut his teeth as a guitarist on the likes 
of The Shadows, Buddy Holly and Django Rheinhardt, developing his own style 
from there.  But he realized the group had no future in the blues:

        'We couldn't keep playing 12-bars forever.  We just got fed up with 
Earth music.  It was jazz, blues stuff.  It was good for practice but nothing 
else.'

    In the late 'Sixties, blues groups were a dime a dozen in Birmingham and 
interest was waning in the blues boom due to the glut of groups.  One man, by 
the name of Jim Simpson, had heard Earth around the Birmingham club circuit and 
understood what they were trying to do.  He decided to take them under his 
wing.  With the aid of his massive record collection, Jim expanded the group's 
horizons in the areas of jazz and blues.  He introduced them to artists like 
Wes Montgomery, Count Basie and Jimmy Rushing.  It was from Rushing in 
particular that they derived the repetitive riff style so readily noticeable in 
their later incarnation as Black Sabbath.

    The Count Basie influence is evidenced in the song ""Wicked World"" from the 
first album; Sabbath drummer Bill Ward uses a ""'sighing hi-hat'...in the manner 
of Basie's drummer Jo Jones.""










    The influence is subtle, almost subliminal.  Yet it is one which was not 
thought capable of hard, 'heavy' rock bands in the late 'Sixties.  Although Led 
Zeppelin and Jimi Hendrix also had their work steeped in blues and jazz 
derivations (Hendrix' ""Third Stone From the Sun"" and Zeppelin's version of 
Willie Dixon's ""I Can't Quit You Baby"" from their first album), neither was 
able to match the intense energy of Black Sabbath.  Iommi has always had a 
preference for music with an original, distinct style of its' own; as an 
example, he mentions guitarists Joe Pass and Alvin Lee as two of his strongest 
songwriting influences.

    It would also be necessary that Sabbath develop a unique, distinctive style 
and image of their own.  Though they had changed their name from Earth to Black 
Sabbath to avoid confusion with the other Earth; at the same time another group 
emerged by the name of Black Widow ""...who WERE profoundly influenced by the 
occult, had a male witch as a patron, and wrote pieces like ""Come to The 
Sabbat.""  Unfortunately, Sabbath was constantly reaping the benefits of Widow's 
publicity.

    Sabbath was a group that never minced words.  If they saw something as 
destructive, they would be sure to rub the listener's face it it.  They did not 
want their point to be missed.

    With their straightforward, sometimes brutal way of looking at things, they 
try to shock the listener's conscience back into awareness.  The imagery of 
""Hand of Doom"", from the Paranoid album, is candid and condemning; it is a 
strong statement against drug addiction and rightly so...

            IT'S TO LATE TOO TURN
            YOU DON'T WANNA LEARN
            PRICE OF LIFE YOU CRY
            NOW YOU'RE GONNA DIE
            
            
    Many people felt the group's overall direction was pessimistic and had a 
negative effect on its listener's due to that.  ""Ozzy insisted that if people 
thought he was having a bad effect on the minds of young kids, they should go 
and watch the TV news where real murder and mayhem were a way of life, and 
shown night after night."" (18)

    Sabbath was never negative in their message; they were simply truthful 
about waht they saw as wrong in the world.  If you ""Strip away the horror 
stories, the imagery and the hysteria, (and) turn down the amps a notch...you 
have a well-rehearsed, solid blues and rock band, powered by a dedication to 
well defined objectives.""  On the top of the list of those objectives was 
truth; Sabbath never feared facing that truth squarely, regardless of what many 
people thought of them.

Long, long, time ago,
I can still remember,
When the local calls were ""free"".
And I knew if I paid my bill,
And never wished them any ill,
That the phone company would let me be...

But Uncle Sam said he knew better,
Split 'em up, for all and ever!
We'll foster competition:
It's good capital-ism!

I can't remember if I cried,
When my phone bill first tripled in size.
But something touched me deep inside,
The day... Bell System... died.

And we were singing...

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

Is your office Step by Step,
Or have you gotten some Crossbar yet?
Everybody used to ask...
Oh, is TSPS coming soon?
IDDD will be a boon!
And, I hope to get a Touch-Tone phone, real soon...

The color phones are really neat,
And direct dialing can't be beat!
My area code is ""low"":
The prestige way to go!

Oh, they just raised phone booths to a dime!
Well, I suppose it's about time.
I remember how the payphones chimed,
The day... Bell System... died.

And we were singing...

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

Back then we were all at one rate,
Phone installs didn't cause debate,
About who'd put which wire where...
Installers came right out to you,
No ""phone stores"" with their ballyhoo,
And 411 was free, seemed very fair!

But FCC wanted it seems,
To let others skim long-distance creams,
No matter 'bout the locals,
They're mostly all just yokels!

And so one day it came to pass,
That the great Bell System did collapse,
In rubble now, we all do mass,
The day... Bell System... died.

So bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

I drove on out to Murray Hill,
To see Bell Labs, some time to kill,
But the sign there said the Labs were gone.
I went back to my old CO,
Where I'd had my phone lines, years ago,
But it was empty, dark, and ever so forlorn...

No relays pulsed,
No data crooned,
No MF tones did play their tunes,
There wasn't a word spoken,
All carrier paths were broken...

And so that's how it all occurred,
Microwave horns just nests for birds,
Everything became so absurd,
The day... Bell System... died.

So bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

We were singing:

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?

We will worship like the Druids,      Some guys have a circumcision

Whether Low Church or it's High Church    I have got a strange religion
Or it's Pie-Up-In-The-Sky Church          I will worship Walter Pidgeon
Come on down and visit my Church          Is he sacred? Just a smidgen!
Cause it's good enough for me!            But it's good enough for me!

Brother Jerry is a cretin             Brother Oral's in his tower,
But with all the cash he's gettin'    Trusting in the Lord's power
Lotsa folks'll be forgettin           Getting richer by the hour,
It's the ""Land of the Free!""          Now he's got the ransom fee!

Brother Robert's church is Crystal     Brother Earnest is a healer
But all the Bible that he's missed'll  And not QUITE a wheeler-dealer --
Make you ""hotter than a pistol""        More a jumper and a squealer
But he's good enough for me!           So he's good enough for me!

Brother Jim and Sister Tammy       Then there's good ol' Brother Billy
Had a show that was a whammy       Bringing souls in willy-nilly.

Tryin' t'get back on TV!           But he's good enough for me!

Let us read works of Confucius         We will worship Xipe-Totec   
As we walk thru Massachusetts          Tho it is a little lo-tek *

But it's good enough for me!           But it's good enough for me!

But it's good enough for me!       And thats good enough for me 

You could join Jehovah's Witness             
Running door to door for fitness
Well if you've been blessed with quickness,
Then thats good enough for me

We used to study old Confucius      And let's not forget Pelagius
As we sat there on our tushes       Though some call him outrageous
We're learning but don't push us    He is pious and courageous
And thats good enough for me        And he's good enough for me!

It's the opera written for us
We will all join in the chorus
It's the opera about Boris
Which is Godunov for me!

   It makes you wonder about King Vissevald
   The King who wears a skirt!                            (16)

   Vissevald is King of the Eastland
   Drinks Imperium Compound by the quart
   He likes it so much he's never noticed
   We now wear daggers into Court!                        (16)

   Vissevald and his Lady Mara
   Danced ""La Volta"" through the night;
   He drank too deep of Imperium Compound,
   And she's now a satellite!                             (16)

   Gavin Kilkenny asked ""Is there any-
   One who would dispute my rightful Throne?
   I'll take a double Imperium Compound,
   For it seems I have a clone!""                          (16)

   AElfwine the Saxon, whose family's flaxen
   Whose courtesy is all the Northland's pride;
   Mixes his mead now with Imperium Compound
   Often a bridesmaid, now a bride!                       (16)

   Siegfried, thrice King, showed us a new thing
   When fighting for the Eastern Crown:
   He took a swig of Imperium Compound
   And proved you CAN win from one-down!                  (16)

   Richard of Mont Roy-al, the Short he
   Is very fast and very hard to kill;
   As tall as Frodo, or his dog, Odo,
   But he kisses Froggies with a will!                     (5)

   Duke Sir Deaton, was never beaten
   On the field, or in the drinking hall;
   At the Catbox War with Caid,
   Left thirty bodies piled against the wall!              (5)

   Denis O'Titans was good at smitin'
   A Locksley Monster in every single way!
   Drank a little Imperium Compound
   And ATE Deaton's sword that day  // No! REALLY! //       (5)

   Wotan the Mongoloid, a little bit paranoid,
   But a nice guy none the less;
   Drank a mess of Imperium Compound
   Now he's Justin du Roc, I confess!                       (5)

10
   Then there's Duke Reynard, with a face like a St. Bernard
   Of the Dukes, he is the homliest
   He tends to toke up on Imperium Compound
   And go out and whomp on anybody's best!                   

   Oh, Ebenezer, thought he was Julius Caesar
   So they put him in the Funny Home.
   Then they gave him Imperium Compound,
   Now he's Emperor of Rome.
                 
   AltChorus: Oh let's drink a drink, a drink, a drink,  
              To Lily the Pink, the Pink, the Pink,
              The savior of the human ra-aa-ace.
              She invented Imperium Compound,
              Most effacatious in evr'y case.

   There was Horic, We thought he was sick,
   As a War-Puppy he was insane,
   Gave up Tranya for Imperium Compound,
   Now we have an Acid Reign!            //Oh wow, man!//   (18)

   This song'll bedevil the folks at a revel,
   And most of the time it will annoy the King,
   So take a drink of Imperium Compound
   And let's go Royalty-bedeviling!                         (5)

   Duchess Anna is quite a fan-a
   Going on a wartime shopping spree!  \\ War Point!\\
   Took a drink of Imperium Compound
   And shopped so fast we couldn't see! \\ Z-o-o-o-om!\\    (5)

   Lyn of Whitewolfe, made of the right stuff,
   Twice the Queen of Atenveldt;
   Took a drink of Imperium Compound
   And the Kingdom of Caid before her knelt!                (5)

   Duke Sir Brion, and Duke Sir Trelon,
   Won the Crown with regularity;
   Drank a lot of Imperium Compound,
   And founded a dynasty!                                   (5)

   Stephan von Geist, was most awful nice,
   And a chivalrous fighter without any doubt
   Took a swig of Imperium Compound
   And won the Crown his first time out!                    (5)

   All the Crusadenes were big, but not mean,
   And the finest fighters in the town.
   But they all drank Jerusalem Compound,
   Winning Crown after Crown after Crown!                   (5)

   Good Duke Arthur couldn't get no farth-er
   A Norman King in Aten Land
   Drank too much of Imperium Compound
   And went off to conquer Engel-land!                      (5)

   Then King Richard, a bit of a bitch, heard
   A King's Crown could be done.
   Drank a little Imperium Compound
   And became the Aten King, first one!                     (5)
11
   There was Astra, no one ever asked her
   And she was for having fun!
   Then she sampled Imperium Compound,
   And today she is a nun   \\ not better!\\               (19)

   There's good old Igor, his prowess is meager
   For he never learned to water-ski!
   But instead he drinks Imperium Compound
   Then he howls and climbs a tree!  \\Hoo Hah!\\          (19)

   Then there's Dagan, his brother's the Ka-Khan,
   Which is quite funny in a King!
   If he gets hooked on Imperium Compound
   There'll be new songs to sing!    \\ Oh, really?\\       (19)  

   Fredrick of Holland, who dwells in the Northland,
   A Master from the West, he came!
   Spends all his money for Imperium Compound
   That's why his garb's always the same!                   (20)

   Now Gyrth Oldcastle, round as a beer barrel,
   Once chose to quarrel with a certain Bard;
   The poet served him with Imperium Compound,
   And left him rendered down to lard!                      (20)

   Many tales abound of Imperium Compound
   And its' strange effects on Royalty,
   But after an hour, this song has no power,
   And by now, it's boring ME!                             (16)

   Duchess Malinda, who doesn't do windas
   But she does a lot of Duchess Things,
   But give her a LOT of Imperium Compound,
   And she sings and sings and sings and sings and sings!   (5)

   AltChorus: Oh it's too long, too long, too long
              To sing the whole song, the song, the song
              Longer than a Royal Court, it is!
              But sing it serial, this ditty Imperial
              And you'll be a bardic whiz!                 (5)

                                             IMPERIUM COMPOUND    
                                             (Atenveldt Verses)

   Now here's a story, a little bit gory,
   A little bit happy, a little bit sad.
   About a drink called Imperium Compound
   And how the SCA's been had!                       

   Chorus: Oh we think, we think, we think,
           The King is a fink, a fink, a fink,
           A figure of respectability
           Rules the Kingdom thru Imperium Compound
           The results are plain to see!

   Mongol Hordemen, those free-living swordsmen
   Subverting the Kingdoms from underneath!
   Have no use for Imperium Compound
   Except perhaps to brush their teeth!

   AltChorus: Oh we fink, we fink, we fink,
              The Khan and the Kink, the Kink, the Kink,
              And the Board, their Great Senilities!
              The Western Irgun, drinks Imperium Compound
              And we're BACK, with results you'll see!    

   Lady Laurel, with Authority Royal,
   Passes and rejects our heraldry
   She needs a swig of Imperium Compound
   Then perhaps she'd deign to talk to me!            

   Lady Trude thought it her duty
   To turn a social wrong into a Right
   Proved her point with Imperium Compound
   And showed that Cheshire Cats can fight!  //and scratch//

   The Board of Directors styled themselves The Electors
   And another con they tried to swing
   Now the BoD drinks Imperium Compound
   So we no longer need a King!                        

   AltChorus: Oh the Bod, the BoD, the BoD,
              It thinks it is God, is God, is God,
              The figure of Supreme Authority!
              And if we O.D.'d on Imperium Compund
              there'd be no need for Royalty!          

   Oh, MEDIEVAL Net, we thought it was all wet
   With witty remarks, and other kinds of sass
   We'll feed our computers on Imperium Compound
   And BYTE the BoD right on its' righteous ass!         

   Good old Duncan was often drunken
   Chasing all the ladies fair
   He bathed himself in Imperium Compound
   Now he has a little savoir faire!                     

                    (more)


  ATEN IMPERIUM (cont.)

   Ioseph of Locksley, never changes his socks, he
   Runs around looking like a Cavalier,
   He stocked up on Imperium Compound
   And he has enough to last for years and years!        

   AltChorus: Oh they forgot, forgot, forgot
              The Locks-e-ly Plot, the Plot, the Plot!
              And it works the best when it is underground!
              It isn't a hassle for a green-and-white tassle
              They're the ones that BREW Imperium Compound!  

   Trelon of the Wood, he was very good, he
   Was a leader that had never been beat before;
   But Caid had Imperium Compound,
   And Imperial Roman Caid won the War!  //with help!//   

   In Tyr Ysgithr, it's regularly whispered there
   That the Kingdom is ruled over by a King    // What's THAT? //
   They're ""democratic"" and quite erratic....
   They've forgot the purpose of the whole damn thing!     

   King Sir Mark von, with his pretty white suit on,
   Rules the Kingdom both with Grace and Purity!
   He never touches Imperium Compound
   At least not where anyone else can see!               

   Duke Sir Deaton, was never beaten
   On the field, or in the drinking hall;
   At the Catbox War with Caid,
   Left thirty bodies piled against the wall!             

   Denis O'Titans was good at smitin'
   A Locksley Monster in every single way!
   Drank a little Imperium Compound
   And ATE Deaton's sword that day  // No! REALLY! //

   But a nice guy none the less;

   Never touches Imperium Compound
(spoken:) And I'll sell ya seashore property in Yuma, too!  

   Optional last verse:

   Many tales abound of Imperium Compound
   And its' strange effects on Royalty,
   But after an hour, this song has no power,
   And by now, it's boring ME!

                recorded: CELTIC CIRCLE DANCE
                          WTP-0002C

        Last night I had the strangest dream in this bleak century
        I dreamed that people the world around believed in Chivalry

        I dreamed I saw a Kingly Crown enshrined in laurel leaves
        with Grace and Joy and Purity attendant at his feet

        I dreamed I saw the perfect Knight receive his accolade
        and minstrels sang and children laughed in some soft forest glade

        I dreamed I saw the finest thing that ever man could make
        grow great and strong and undefiled: Pray God I never wake!

        Last night I had the strangest dream in this bleak century
        I dreamed that people the world around believed in Chivalry

               (to the tune of ""Good King Wenceslaus"")

                Locksley Monsters never yield
                on the field of battle
                strike the helm and bash the shield
                make their eyeteeth rattle
                Bodies on the ground will lie
                bones will burst in sunder
                search for Locksleys' enemies:
                You'll find them six feet under!

                              SONG OF IVANOF

            There is a man who we know well that does the best he can
            but he's displayed in armour made of reticulated garbage cans!

            He looks so fine and fair and strong, oh how he plays the man
            and how it's prized, those galvanized, reticulated garbage cans

            The noblest Roman of them all, a good Praetorian
            a combatant who wears no pants, judst reticulated garbage cans!

            Like old Horatius at the Bridge, like the Legions of Valerian
            (O dearie me: those LOVELY knees!)
            and those reticulated garbage cans!

                         C. McCray Bethancourt

         (sung to the tune (obviously) of the 12 Days of Christmas)


1.           The first time I sent my device, The Heralds said to me

            ""It violates the Rule of Three""

2.           The next time I tried it, the Heralds said to me

            ""We changed the forms, and it violates the Rule of
             Three"".

3.           The third time I tried, and the Heralds said to me, 

            ""We upped the fees, we changed the forms, and it
             violates the Rule of Three"".

4.           Another time I tried and the Heralds said to me,
 
            ""We haven't got it, we upped the fees, we changed the 
             forms, and it violates the Rule of Three"".

5.           The fifth time I tried it, the Heralds said to me,  

            ""In a decision rendered by the College of Arms on
             August 1st, A.S. V it was decided that this style of
             heraldic design was not appropriate to the aims and 
             intentions of the Corporate Body. Holy! Holy! Holy! ""

 note: verse 5 is delivered in an extremely fast, mono-
       tone, similiar to a Gregorian Chant.

           "" ....we haven't got it, we upped the fees, we changed the forms,
             and it violates the Rule of Three.""

6.           I tried it a sixth time, and the Heralds said to me,

            ""We changed the rules, &c""

7.           A seventh time I tried and, the Heralds said to me,

            ""It's against the Rule of Tincture, we changed the
             rules, &c""

8.           I tried it once again and the heralds said to me,

            ""It's not a Period design, It's against the Rule of Tincture, We
             changed the rules, &c""

                                * more *



    Heralds Said To Me (cont.)

9.           I sent it in once more, and the Heralds said to me,

            ""We changed the rules again, It's not a Period design,
             it's against the Rule of Tincture, we changed the
             rules, &c""

10. (sung in cold anger)
             The LAST time I sent my device, the Heralds said to me

    (sung in a state of SMUG)
             ""Someone else has got it, &c""




              (nb: every single one of these reasons has been used by the
              CoA, at one point or another, to reject perfectly good
              heraldry, along with some even MORE stupid.  If the shoe 
              fits....................!!!!!!!!)

                        BUGS ON THE BARONESS
                        Tune: Waltzing Matilda
 
           or: Who was that Vermin I saw you with last, Knight?
   or: There may be Lice on all you Knice, but there ain't no Lice on me

           Once there was a Barony howling in the wilderness
           nestled in the Valley where the River doesn't flow
           and the folks were driven buggy by the insects in the Revel Hall
           Authenticity is wonderful, but this doesn't go!

                   Bugs on the Baroness, bugs on the Baroness!
                   That was the cry that you heard all the day
                   and the scratching can be heard from Ysgithr to Ered Sul
                   why did we come here? Let's go away!

           See them all a scratching, nestled in their armour tight
           the fleas have a melee team that's challenging the field!
           call Truly Nolen! Someone's gotta help us out!
           the crabs are nesting in our helms but we'll never yield!

                   (chorus)

           Dawn comes a-breaking, the bugs have won the Coronet...
           flea-infested Conan-clones in piles upon the lawn
           where is the Barony? The bugs have eaten everyone...
           termites got the stick-jocks, and all their sticks are gone!

                  For all the Lands where I have dwelt
                  Oh Atenveldt, Oh Atenveldt
                  till rivers burn and mountains melt
                  lest I forget my Atenveldt
                  From deserts stark to snow-capped peaks
                  from silent lakes and laughing creeks
                  sing: Oh let man find his heart's ease
                  on rocky plains
                  in desert breeze

                  For oft I thought of mighty men
                  who carved a Land with sword and pen
                  and lit a candle, burning bright,
                  that pierced the darkness; stirred the night!
                  tho some are gone their deeds remain
                  this sunny Crown without a stain
                  sing: Oh, their deeds were not in vain!
                  in sunlit days
                  and falling rain.....

                  So raise your banners, blazoned bright
                  Advance the Dream and Shine the Light!
                  in battle's crash and Revel's song
                  raise high the Flag and wave it long!
                  For all the Lands wherein I've dwelt
                  I love you best, my Atenveldt!
                  Sing: Oh the Joy that I have felt!

      What the use of wearing panties
      whalebone corsets of your Auntie's
      boxer shorts and other scanties
      best of all is nude
      there's such fun in going bra-less
      now that it's no longer lawless
      'specially if your figure's flawless
      best of all is nude
      nude is what you're born in
      shirts are never torn in
      underwear and lacy flimsies, garter belts and other whimsies
      yards of itchy cloth to put your form in
      ducks all do it, maidens rue it
      even ancient Picts in Britain blue it
      going naked's how to do it
      best of all is nude!

      If your garters aren't elastic
      tie them up in knots fantastic
      (panty hose is something drastic!)
      best of all is nude!
      If you're tired of wearing clotheses
      shed your garment 'mongst the roses
      never mind the old bluenoses
      best of all is nude!
      Nude is best for ducking!
      Worst for horses bucking!
      Moonlit nights will see such sights
          that are very best for fooling round
                              .....and elbows!
      Nudity is grand to see
       a well-known antidote to virginity
      take your clothes off and you'll see:
      best of all is nude!

                   once I talked to a great Grey Man
                   spun three times and said with a sigh
                   hadn't been for the Runes had his other eye!

                   prettiest thing I've ever seen
                   she went down underneath the hill
                   and came back out of her own free will

                   Brian Boru, on Irish ground
                   walked three times the Island round
                   Norsemen came lookin for a fight
                   just another Irish Saturday night!

                   Hi said Lugh on the banquest night
                   a poet and a player and a good wheelwright
                   a harper and a warrior and none the least:
                   a Druid and he got in to the Feast!

                   Harold Haardrada's face was red!

                   got six feet of English ground

                   the Legion with it's Eagles bright
                   marched into the Pictish night
                   met them there upon the sand
                   gave em up to the Wicker Man!

                   eight-legged steed and hound of Hel

                   Present is Past and Past is Me!

                   Rhiannon's Birds are still in flight

                   sang the Day and sang the Night
                   sang the Land and sang the Sea
                   sang the Song, and then sang Me!

                                  came the Lady to the lea

                                  spread their seeds thruout the Land

                                  saw the Lady where she stood
                                  by the fire burning bright
                                  came to know his heart's delight!

                    WEAPONS AT THE DOOR

 Being a Polemic concerning the alleged Custom of the West Kingdom concerning 
 checking your Weapons at the Door of the Revel Hall. As the Satire is the 
 Weapon of the Bard, this said Polemic is to be checked at the Door, along with 
 swords, knives, redheaded Ladies and other such Deadly Things.....

         As I roved out to Western Lands to take the Western Air
         I went into a Revel Hall and I saw a Twelfth Night there
         but I was halted at the gate by a Privy Consellor
                 (that's the man who tells the King of the West how to go to
                  the bath room!)
         who told me I would have to check my Weapons at the door

         As I, in my astonishment, stood hung on tenter-pegs
         a Knight came in whose Prouess hung down between his legs
         the Doorman grabbed a greatsword and he struck the Knight full sore
         and gave him a reciept; he left his weapon at the door!

         a Bard was next whose goodly Voice has entertained us all
         but he, too, was prevented from entering the Hall
         and told he could not carry deadly weapons on the floor
         he left his Voice and Harp among the weapons at the door

         a Master entered graciously, a man we all know well
         who holds a 3rd Dan Black Belt, tho this he'd never tell
         the Master struggled valiantly, the Master cursed and swore
         but he left his hands, and feet, as weapons at the door

         the company was jovial, altho a bit dismayed
         for lack of proper cutlery, down to the smallest blade
         for even teeth and fingernails, each can be used in War
         were cut, and pulled, and left behind, as weapons at the door!

         And has their King not loyal Knights that He must be afraid
         of brawling in his Hall and of Assassin's bloody blade?
         the Rights of Men to carry Arms at least WE'VE not foreswore
         and a POX on them that made the Rule of Weapons at the Door!

                           THE STREETS OF ANN ARBOR

               As I walked out thru the streets of Ann Arbor
               as I walked out thru Ann Arbor one day
               I spied a young Mongol all dressed in white linen
               all dressed in white linen and cold as the clay

               I then spied another, done in on the sidewalk
               along with just about six dozen more
               their wounds were all gaping, from mace and from braoadsword
               from claymore and cannon, all dripping with gore

               what caused this grave carnage, I cried to the Monglos
               oh pray what's the reason for this awful sight
               my answer came slowly from under the corpse-pile
               ""It seems that our bark is much worse than our bite.....""

               the answer continued from pale lips a-shaking
               we sang all our songs and believed them as true
               the Dark Horde could never be beaten in battle
               we thought this was what all good Mongols could do...

               we went down to Atenveldt all for to plunder
               ""too large to defend"" was our song every night
               but Atenveldt's different from East, West or Middle
               there, even the bushes have learned how to bite!

               the Clann stole our ponies, the Scraelings our foodstuffs
               we ran into axes in AtenViking hands
               our maidens ran off with one Richard of Arkham
               and we're all that's left to return to our lands

               MacChluarains and Monsters, Lockehaven and Foxmoor
               that Kingdom is BIG and its' fighters are MEAN!
               we fought and we lost, and fled back to Ann Arbor
               we all came back home with results that you've seen

               keep away from that Land with its' cactus and marshes
               it's no place for Mongols who are bent on War
               they count their blows well, but they strick them yet better
               he crawled into his Yurt, and fell, dead, on the floor.....

       tune: the song of the Cowardly Lion, Tin Woodsman and Scarecrow
             in the movie version of the Wizard of Oz

        (Enter the Scarecrow, who singeth:)

        My wife is always nagging; my Prowess it is lagging
        I can't do anything
        she has got a reason, but revenge is out of season
        Oh I wish I could be King!

        If I just had the Crown on, I'd always have a frown on
        and the Barons on a string
        Heads they would be rolling, the Board would be cajoling
        Oh if only I was King!

        I am very fed up with the way this group is set up
        Oh I'd change everything!
        they are so high and mighty with the way that they do fight-ey
        Oh, someday I'll be King!

        Tho my wife is melancholic, and very...vitriolic
        she's a wasp without a sting!
        I'd have to supervise her with a pack of tranquilizers
        If I only was a King......

        (the Tin Woodsman joineth him, and singeth:)

        I grew up kind of cocky, and rather big, and stocky
        and straight as any rod
        on the field I'm a battallion, with the Ladies I'm a stallion
        ...Oh they'd better make me God!

        The other boys are jealous they say I'm over-zealous
        they'd do better to applaud
        the things that I am giving to this Dream that we are living
        oh I wish they'd make me God!

        They say that I'm conceited, but I'm just badly treated
        by people and by BoD
        just think of what they're missing by My Majesty dismissing
        Oh they'd better make me God!

        (the Cowardly Lion creepeth forth, and singeth:)

        Oh I could be a fighter, a great and mighty smiter
        and be the perfect knight
        it's a great and nasty shame, and everyone's to blame
        oh I wish that I could fight!

        Song of the Three (cont.)

        I could be a Cavalier drinking wine and ale and beer
        and be a gorgeous sight
        but it would cost me too much money so it isn't very funny
        oh I wish that I could fight!                               

        Let me at 'em on the field, I would surely make them yield

                She was afraid to come out to the Tourney
                She was worried that ""something might show..""
                She was afraid to come out to the Tourney
                And the poor thing did NOT want to go...

                One day in the Kingdom of the Middle
                It happened at a Tourney one day:
                The Mongols invaded the Middle
                But the Middle did not want to play...

                  (eins - zwei - drei, but the Dark Horde wouldn't die!)

                      by William Poundstone
                              1983

     Two mentalities are at work here: 1960s rock fans and 1980s
fundamentalist Christians. The idea of phonographically concealed
messages dates from the Paul McCartney death scare of 1969. For
hard-core types, the secret-message rumors never really died. Avid
rock fans have auditioned ever album release since the late 1960s
for hidden nuances. Backward messages, barely audible messages,
and messages on one stereo track only have been alleged. At the
other end of the sociosensual spectrum, fundamentalist Christians
have gotten into the act. TV programs such as PRAISE THE LORD and
THE 700 CLUB have propagated rumors of a satanic plot in the
recording industry, no less, in which various albums conceal
""backward-masked"" demonic murmurings. If THAT sounds too spacey to
be taken seriously, consider that it was the fundamentalist groups
who were behind House Resolution 6363, a bill introduced in the
U.S. House of Representatives by Robert K. Dornan (R., Calif.) in
1982 to label all suspect records: ""WARNING: THIS RECORD CONTAINS
BACKWARD MASKING THAT MAKES A VERBAL STATEMENT WHICH IS AUDIBLE
WHEN THIS RECORD IS PLAYED BACKWARD AND WHICH MAY BE PERCEPTIBLE
AT A SUBLIMINAL LEVEL WHEN THIS RECORD IS PLAYED FORWARD."" In
February 1983, the Arkansas State Senate passed a similar record-
labeling bill by a vote of 86 to 0.
     Contributing to the quasi-occult status of these rumors is
the difficulty of checking them out on home audio equipment. You
pretty much have to take someone else's word for it, or dismiss
the rumors out of hand.
     From a technical standpoint, there are four simple ways to
conceal a verbal message on a recording. The most obvious is to
record the message at a very low volume. The message may then be
recovered by turning the volume up while playing the record or
tape. If the message is faint enough, though, noise levels of home
equipment may garble it. If the accompanying music or lyrics are
loud enough, or if the message itself is indistinct or
electronically modified, it may be hard to hear on any equipment.
     A second gimmick is to record a message on one stereo track
only. Records and tapes have two independent recordings, of
course, normally played simultaneously for stereo effect. On a
record, each stereo track occupies on one side of the V-shaped
groove for the needle. On a tape, the tracks are recorded in
parallel lanes of the magnetic material. The two tracks are called
""right"" and ""left"" after the stereo speakers they will play on.
Otherwise, the tracks are interchangeable -- the sound mixer can
put anything he or she wants on each track. A message on one track
can be masked by simultaneous loud music or lyrics on the opposite
track. With normal stereo balance (or mono equipment) the loud
track drowns out the message track. At home, single-track messages
can be recovered by adjusting the stereo balance so that only the
desired track plays. Sometimes this trick also makes indistinct
words clearer. Even if the words are not exclusively on one track,
they may happen to be more audible on one track.
     A message could be recorded at a speed different from the
rest of the record. Then the record would have to be played faster
or slower than usual to recover the message. Unless the message
was at one of the standard speeds (say, 45 rpm on a 33 1/3 rpm
record), it could not be played normally on home equipment.
     The fourth and most commonly alleged trick is to record a
verbal message backward. Reversed speech has several unexpected
features. One is that syllables are not a constant in the reversal
process. A one-syllable word can have two or three syllables when
played backward. Thus ""number nine"" in the Beatles' REVOLUTION 9
reverses to ""Turn me on, dead man"" (or something like it), a jump
from three to five syllables.
     There is no simple way to predict what a word or phrase will
sound like reversed. Obviously, you can't just reverse the
letters.
     Reversed messages are difficult to recover at home. Record
turntables are not built to go backwards. Some have a neutral
setting, in which the pickup and amplifier remain active and you
can turn the record backward by hand. But hardly anyone has a
stead enough hand to produce satisfactory results.
     With patience, it is possible to reverse a cassette
recording. Transfer the music from the original record or tape
onto a blank tape cassette. Place the cassette flat on a table.
Draw our the part of the tape with the suspected message and snip
it off at both ends. Hold the tape segment horizontally. Rotate it
180 degrees, keep it horizontal at all times. This turns the tape
end for end. Splice the reversed tape segment back onto the two
loose ends of the cassette with strong adhesive tape. Reel the
tape back inside the cassette. The sliced segment will play
backward on an ordinary cassette player.
     I rented a recording studio to test the secret-message
rumors. New copiies of the records in question were transcribed on
a quarter-inch master tape. Where rumor alleged that a single
stereo track contained a message, right and left stereo tracks
were transcribed separately. Records with alleged inaudible
messages were treated similarly. To test claims of reversed
messages, recordings on the master tape were edited out and
spliced in backward. Twenty cuts or portions of cuts from sixteen
albums were tested.


""Another One Bites the Dust""
Queen, THE GAME

Rumor: When played backward, the lyrics say, ""It's fun to smoke
marijuana.""
Findings: There is something that sounds like ""It's fun to smoke
marijuana"" in the reversed music. It is repeated over and over. It
might be rendered no less faithfully, however, as ""sfun to scout
mare wanna."" This ""message"" is the reversal of the song title,
which is repeated as a line in the song.
     Let's make a distinction between engineered and phonetic
reversals. When an artist records a verbal statement, reverses it
by turning the tape end for end, mixes the reversed statement onto
a master tape, and has records and tapes produced from the master,
that is an engineered reversal. When the phonetic properties of
song lyrics are such that they can be reversed to sound like
something else, that is a phonetic reversal.
     ""It's fun to smoke marijuna"" is clearly a phonetic reversal.
The lyrics are perfectly plain played forward (""Another one bites
the dust""), no so plain played backward (""sfun to scout mare
wanna""). With an engineered reversal, the opposite should hold
true: gibberish forward, clear as a bell backward. Some are
prepared to believe that phonetic reversals are just as
intentional as engineered reversals -- that the songwriter
painstakinginly planned the phonetic double-entendre. In the
absence of confirming evidence, that just doesn't wash. It's too
easy to find coincidences. If, for example, the letters of the
alphabet are recited in conventional fashion (Ay, Bee, Cee, etc.)
and reversed, at least five sound like English language words. D
reverses to ""eden,"" F becomes ""pray,"" S becomes ""say,"" V becomes
""even,"" and Z becomes ""easy."" ""It's fun to smoke marijuana"" is
likewise a coincidence.


""A Child is Coming""
Jefferson Starship, BLOWS AGAINST THE EMPIRE

Rumor: When played backward, ""son of Satan.""
Findings: Another phonetic coincidence. The repeated ""It's getting
better"" reverses to an iffy ""son of Satan,"" the ""of"" drawn out and
the ""Satan"" strongly accented on the first syllable.


""Eldorado""
Electric Light Orchestra, ELDORADO

Rumor: When played backward, ""He is the nasty one/ Christ, you're
infernal/ It is said we're dead men/ Everyone who has the mark
will live.""
Findings: Coincidence. The supposed message lurks around the line
""On a voyage of no return to see."" Reversed, this passage becomes
the expected syllable salad -- no one hearing it would describe it
as anything but reversed music. Only if you listen while reading
along with what you're supposed to hear will you get anything. The
rumored version of the message is somewhat fudged. The passage
sounds more like ""He's to nasty one/ Christ you are, Christ,
you're fernal/ There wiss uh, we're dead men..."" There is no ""in""
in what is taken to be ""infernal."" The line that is supposed to be
""Everyone who has the mark will live"" isn't even close, though the
syllable count is right.


""Shoo Be Doo""
The Cars, CANDY-O

Rumor: When played backward, the word ""Satan"" repeated
approximately eleven times.
Findings: Coincidence. The rumor refers to the reversal of the ""Shoo
be doo, shoo be doo, shoo be doo..."" near the end of the song. Given
the mysterious logic of reversed phonemes, these three-syllable units
can be hard as a repeated two-syllable word. The word sounds a little
like ""Satan.""


""Snowblind""
Styx, PARADISE THEATER

Rumor: According to a mimeographed list of suspect records distributed
by Congressman Dornan, the words ""Satan move through our voices"" when
played backwards.
Findings: Negative. Despite repeated listenings, it was not even
possible to identify the part of the reversed track that Dornan et al.
are talking about.


""Stairway to Heaven""
Led Zeppelin, untitled, a.k.a. STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN

Rumor: In reverse, ""I live for Satan... The Lord turns me off...
There's no escaping it... Here's to my sweet Satan... There's power in
Satan... He will give you 666.""
Findings: Coincidence. If you listen very carefully to the ""And it
makes me wonder"" lines in reverse, you'll hear something approaching
""There's no escaping it."" A better description is ""There's no escape
do."" Knock of the last syllable, and you have ""There's no escape,"" a
complete, intelligible sentence in reverse. It's there, all right, but
it's not an unlikely enough coincidence to -- well, make you wonder.
      The ""Satan"" in ""I live for Satan"" is good and clear. The ""I live
for"" part isn't. The other alleged lines are unremarkable. All are
phonetic reversals of the entirely lucid forward lyrics and obviously
just accidents.


""When Electricity Came to Arkansas""
Black Oak Arkansas, BLACK OAK ARKANSAS and RONCH AND ROLL

Rumor: In reverse, ""Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan. He is God. He
is God.""
Findings: The BLACK OAK ARKANSAS cut was reversed. Again, pairs of
reversed syllables are being freely interpreted as ""Satan."" ""He is
God"" was not identifiable.


""Rain""
The Beatles, HEY JUDE

Rumor: Unintelligible lyrics at the end are reversed.
Findings: A true engineered reversal and not really a secret. ""Rain""
seems to have been the first popular recording to incorporate an
obviously reversed lyric. The story is that John Lennon accidentally
spliced the last part of the song in backward and liked the effect.
When reversed, the strange-sounding vocals at the end become
intelligible as a reprise starting with the drawn-out word
""sunshine.""
      The reversal is less apparent to the casual listener than it
might be because the accompanying music is not reversed. The ending
fits in smoothly with the rest of the song, the vocals suggesting a
foreign language.


""Fire on High""
Electric Light Orchestra, FACE THE MUSIC

Rumor: When played backward, ""The music is reversible, but time --
turn back!""
Findings: ""Fire on High"" is instrumental. About twenty-six seconds
into the music, scrambled speech is heard. It is mostly louder than
the accompanying music and begins with a two-syllable unit repeated
several times. The seeming speech lasts for about fourteen seconds.
      Reversing the music confirms that there is a true, engineered
message. In reverse, a voice (Jeff Lynne's?) says, ""The music is
reversible, but time -- turn back! Turn back! Turn back! Turn back!""
All the words are clear and unambiguous. Anyone comparing this to the
alleged reversal on ELO's ""Eldorado"" will have no trouble telling
which is genuine.


""Goodbye Blue Sky""
Pink Floyd, THE WALL

Rumor: In reverse, ""You have discovered the secret message.""
Findings: The ""secret message"" is at the very end of the instrumental
passage following the ""Goodbye Blue Sky"" vocals. It comes just before
the words ""What shall we do"" at the start of the song that is
identified as ""Empty Spaces"" on the record label and as ""What shall we
do now?"" on the record sleeve. Played forward, the message is less
apparent than the FACE THE MUSIC reversal: A reasonably attentive
listener might play THE WALL through and not catch it. It suggests
speech not quite close enough to be overheard. In context this is not
unusual because the ""Goodbye Blue Sky"" instrumental passage includes
""airport noises"" and other sound effects. A loud climax in the music
further masks the unintelligible voice.
      When played backward, the voice (Roger Waters?) plainly intones,
""Congratulations, you have just discovered the secret message. Please
send your answer to old Pink, care of the funny farm..."" As the voice
fades out, there may be another word -- perhaps ""Chalfonte or
""Chelsea"" -- after ""funny farm.""


""Heavy Metal Poisoning""
Styx, KILROY WAS HERE

Rumor: A red sticker on the KILROY WAS HERE cover warns, ""By order of
the Majority for Musical Morality, this album contains secret backward
messages...""
Findings: This is a case of second-generation backward-masking. Styx'
PARADISE THEATER did not contain a backward message, though a lot of
people said it did. So Styx has included a sure enough backward
message on KILROY WAS HERE. It is at the very beginning of ""Heavy
Metal Poisoning."" The reversed speech last about three seconds. There
is no musical background. The words reverse to ""Annuit coeptis. Novus
ordo seclorum."" This is the Latin motto encircling the pyramid on the
back of a dollar bill. The usual translation: ""God has favored our
undertakings. A new order of the ages.""
      The cover sticker's ""Majority for Musical Morality"" is a
fictitious Falwellesque group in the KILROY WAS HERE video. Although
the sticker suggests a plurality of ""messages,"" only one was found.


Space between ""I'm So Tired"" and ""Blackbird""
The Beatles, untitled, a.k.a. THE WHITE ALBUM

Rumor: A reversed message. At the time of the Paul-is-dead stories,
the segue from ""I'm So Tired"" to ""Blackbird"" was offered as evidence.
It was held to contain John Lennon's voice, reveresed, saying ""Paul is
dead, miss him, miss him, miss him."" That interpretation seems
unlikely now, but there is a mysterious low muttering between the
songs.
Findings: The mumbling is actually just to the ""I'm So Tired"" side of
the shiny ""space"" between cuts on the record. Each of the stereo
tracks was recorded separately, twice, and a copy of each track was
reversed. This produced four versions of the two-second passage: right
forward, left forward, right reversed, and left reversed. All were
equally unintelligible. It was not even apparent whether the voice is
forward or reversed. Nor could John Lennon be identified as the
speaker. There are nine or ten syllables. The first six (when played
forward) are a two-syllable unit repeated three times. There is little
or no difference betwen the stereo tracks. Any claimed interpretation
of the sounds seems doubtful.


""Strawberry Fields Forever""
The Beatles, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR

Rumor: It was, of course, claimed that John Lennon says ""I buried
Paul"" at the end. (It's forward, at the very end after the music
fades to complete silence, returns, and starts to fade out again.)
But Lennon told ROLLING STONE that the words are ""cranberry
sauce.""
Findings: They are ""cranberry sauce."" The ""sauce""/""Paul"" part is
indistinct, but the first syllable sounds a lot more like ""cran""
than ""I.""


""Baby You're a Rich Man""
The Beatles, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR

Rumor: On one of the tracks the line ""Baby you're a rich man too""
is sung as ""Baby you're a rich fag Jew,"" a dig at Brian Epstein.
Or some think it's ""rich fat Jew"" and claim it as evidence of
Beatle anti-Semitism.
Findings: Negative. The two stereo tracks are nearly identical.
It's always possible to hear words as similar-sounding words, but
basically, the lyrics jibe with the published version.


""Revolution 9""
The Beatles, untitled, a.k.a. THE WHITE ALBUM

Rumor: Various reversed and/or one-track speech. The reversal of
""Number nine"" to ""Turn me on, dead man"" has pretty much been
discounted as coincidence (though it appears on Congressman
Dornan's list).
Findings: Distinction between lyrics and any hidden message blurs
on ""Revolution 9."" The eight-minute cut is a montage of sounds
collected by John Lennon and Yoko Ono. It includes discordant
music, radio broadcasts, sirens, applause, gunfights, sports
cheers, the crackling of a fire, screams, a baby gurgling, a choir
singing, and much that cannot be identified. For this
investigation, ""Revolution 9"" was transcribed four times, twice on
each stereo channel. One copy of each of the tracks was reversed.
The four resulting versions were compared with each other and
against the original two-channel version.
     ""Revolution 9"" contains a lot of talking. Played in stereo,
forward, the longest stretch of understandable speech is probably
an announcer saying, ""...every one of them knew that as time went
by they'd get a little bit older and a little bit slower...""
     One believable instance of reversed speech occurs: someone
saying ""Let me out! Let me out!"" (once held to represent McCartney
in his totaled Aston-Martin). Two iffy reversals occur on the
backward recording of the right stereo track:""She used to be
assistant"" and ""There were two men..."" Neither is clear enough or
long enough to be convincing. Some of the music, including the
recurring theme, sounds more natural in reverse.
     ""Turn me on, dead man"" is a typical phonetic reversal. The
forward ""number nine"" (repeated throughout the cut) is clear; the
reversal is slurred -- something like ""turn me on dedmun."" It has
been claimed that ""number nine"" must be pronounced with a British
accent or with some careful inflection in order to reverse to
""Turn me on, dead man."" This seems not to be so. As an experiment,
three American-accent renderings of ""number nine"" were reversed.
All sound about as much like ""Turn me on, dead man"" as the record
did. Like the other phonetic reversals, ""Turn me on, dead man""
must be considered a coincidence.
     Much of ""Revolution 9"" is on one stereo track only. Near the
end a voice says ""A fine natural imbalance...the Watusi...the
twist...Eldorado...Eldorado."" ""A fine natural imbalance"" is on the
right track only, though the words that follow are in stereo. One
of the longer bits of speech -- ""Who could tell what he was
saying? His voice was low and his [unintelligible] was high and
his eyes were low"" -- is clear on the left track, a bare whisper
on the right.
     There is a stereophonically concealed ""secret message"" on
""Revolution 9."" The words are on the right track. They begin about
four minutes, fifty-eight seconds into the cut and run for about
twenty-two seconds. They are not likely to be noticed in stereo
because of the much louder left track. The sound of applause
begins on the left track at about five minutes, one second into
the cut. Deafening noises -- the clapping, sirens, music --
continue on the left track until five minutes, forty seconds. It
may or may not have been Lennon's and Ono's intention to conceal
the spoken passage. Given the haphazard quality of ""Revolution 9,""
the concealment may have been accidental. To recover the passage,
the left track must be switched off. The right track can then be
heard to contain a sound like a stopwatch ticking, behind these
words:

     So the wife called, and we better go to see a
     surgeon....[A SCREAM MUFFLES A LINE THAT SOUNDS LIKE
     Well, what with the prices, the prices have snowballed,
     no wonder it's closed.] ...So any and all, we went to
     see the dentist instead, who gave him a pair of teeth,
     which wasn't any good at all. So instead of that he
     joined the bloody navy and went to sea.
                      by William Poundstone
                              1986

     There really are backward messages on rock albums. And the
controversy over ""backward masking"" and ""porn rock"" has inspired a
whole new spate of messages. There may have been more genuine
backward messages in the past few years than ever before.
     The backward message controversy is usually traced to the
1960s and John Lennon's avant-garde sound mixing on such tracks as
""Revolution 9"" on the Beatles' WHITE ALBUM. Lennon probably wasn't
trying to conceal a message so much as create an interesting
sound.
     The matter might have ended right there had it not been for
the Paul McCartney death rumor. College kids tried playing Beatles
records forward, backward, and at various speeds to find ""clues""
to McCartney's fate. In the process they found snippets of speech
from Lennon's experiments. Even after McCartney was found safe and
sound in Scotland, some listeners continued to look for hidden
messages.
     Somehow, fundamentalist Christian groups became convinced
(ca. 1982) that the alleged messages were commercials for devil
worship. Not a single indisputable satanic message has turned up,
but there were scattered attempts to ban or label certain albums.
In 1986 one fundamentalist group announced that the theme song for
the old MR. ED TV show contains the word ""Satan"" when played
backward.)
     Ironically, the publicity accorded nonexistent messages has
inspired several artists -- among them porn rock hearing witness
Frank Zappa -- to hide real background messages in their music.
It's easy to do.
     The performer speaks or sings the message normally, then
reverses the tape, which is mixed into the soundtrack. This is all
accomplished simply enough at any recording studio.
     What's not so simple is playing it back. More home record,
cassette, and compact disk players won't play backward. You can
turn a record backward with a pencil eraser, but it's not good for
the needle or the turntable. The only way to reproduce the message
with full fidelity is to use a professional-quality reel-to-reel
tape player and splice the tape in backward.
     We used the facilities of KLOS radio in Los Angeles to
reverse some recent records containing true backward messages.


""Secret Messages""
Electric Light Orchestra, SECRET MESSAGES

ELO's ELDORADO album was among those alleged to contain satanic
backward masked messages. A patient listening to ELDORADO played
backward reveals no such messages. You hear only what you ought to
hear -- the reversed lyrics of the songs, which sound nothing like
the ""messages"" claimed to be there. In the wake of such
allegations, ELO did put an (innocuous) backward message on their
FACE THE MUSIC album. Perhaps they thought this would show how
silly the allegations were. Instead, the backward-masking people
seized on this as proof that the other ""messages"" were real. In
the latest volley, ELO has named an album after the controversy.
     In Britain (where the backward-masking issue is viewed as an
American eccentricity), the cover of SECRET MESSAGES has a mock
warning label to youth about the hidden label. Word of the albums'
impending release in the United States caused enough of a furor to
chill CBS Records into deleting the cover blurb.
     The reversed message is easy to find. It's at the beginning
of the first song, which is itself called ""Secret Messages."" You
can hear reversed speech when you play the record normally. A
voice intones ""secret messages"" -- forward -- in the middle of the
reversed speech, lest anyone dare be so unhip as to not know
what's going on.
     We transferred a new copy of SECRET MESSAGES to reel-to-reel
tapes and played it backward. The backward message goes: ""WELCOME
TO THE BIG SHOW/ WELCOME TO THE BIG SHOW.""
     That's it.


""Ya Hozna""
Frank Zappa, THEM OR US

""Ya Hozna,"" a six-minute composition on the first record of the
THEM OR US double album, is ENTIRELY backward. The albums' inner
cover, which includes lyrics for the other songs, says, ""backwards
vocal -- you figure it out"" of this cut. It credits Frank and Moon
Zappa, George Duke, and Napoleon Murphy Brock as vocalists.
     Played forward, ""Ya Howza"" sounds like a record played
backward -- reasonably so. The vocals are prominent and
unintelligible. Moon Zappa's voice is curiously recognizable, even
in reverse. It is hard to tell whether the music was recorded
forward or backward.
     When ""Ya Howza"" is played in reverse, you discover that the
music is virtually a palindrome -- it sounds about the same
forward and backward. The voices are all backward. In some cases
they have been modified electronically. Many of the words are
muffled. Even after repeated careful listening on both stereo
tracks, it is difficult to make out many of the lyrics. It doesn't
help that some of the words seem to be stream-of-consciousness
nonsense. Some of the unintelligible stuff sounds like opera.
     Starting at the beginning of the reversed tape -- the end of
the forward tape -- the clearer vocals go like this: ""I am the
heaven, I am the water."" This is in a hymnlike register. ""You are
a lonely little girl./ But your mommy and your daddy hold you."" A
singsong synthesizer voice.
     The most interesting part of the lyrics is an intermittently
orgasmic rap in Moon Zappa's Valley Girl voice. There are three
short monologues:

I'm like green!
I'm like squat!
I'm like soul!
Repeat, like soul!
I'm like pull, push,
Okay, like slow, slow.

You're never too old
Like slow, like slow, like slow
Okay, I like it.


All right, faster, faster,
Go, do it, do it twice,
Yeah, that feels good,
I'm looking great,
Yeah, fer shure!
Like, no way!


""No Anchovies, Please""
J. Geils Band, LOVE STINKS

""No Anchovies, Please"" is a novelty song, really a narration with
sound effects, about a woman who is kidnapped after eating
anchovies. She is taken to a ""foreign-speaking"" country. The sound
effect of the foreign tongue seems reversed. When you do play it
in reverse, it becomes: ""It doesn't take a genius to know the
difference between chicken shit and chicken salad.""


""Darling Nikki""
Prince, PURPLE RAIN

""Darling Nikki,"" cited as porn rock before Congress, is about a
dominatrix in a hotel lobby masturbating with a magazine. In part,
the complaint was that the album cover (flowers, and Prince on a
motorcycle) wasn't explicit enough to warn kids of the suggestive
lyrics. Senator Paula Hawkins apparently was not aware of a
backward message hidden in ""Darling Nikki."" The last thirty-five
seconds of the song is gibberish. The music changes abruptly and
becomes a repeated glottal sound. Then a two-syllable sound is
repeated twice, something like ""heaven, heaven."" Unintelligible
speech follows. At the end is a sound reminiscent of rain or bacon
frying , and wind sounds.
     Played backward, the message becomes:

     Hello, how are you?
     I'm fine 'cause I know that the Lord is coming soon.
     Coming, coming soon.

     It is clearly Prince and the Revolution singing this. The
words are clear but the intonation is funny -- the linger on some
words. Perhaps this is to make the reversed message you hear
playing the record normally a little less conspicuous.
     This is a weird reversal of the supposed secret message
menace. Raunchy forward lyrics conceal a religious secret message.


""Judas Kiss""
Petra, MORE POWER TO YOU

Petra is an obscure group that sings religious songs to a rock
beat. As further proof that things have gone full circle, the
backward-masking controversy prompted Petra to include a wholesome
backward message on their MORE POWER TO YOU album. It is in the
transition between two songs, just before ""Judas Kiss."" Clearly
audible gibberish reverses to this (the husky voice a cross
between George Beverly Shea and Dee Snider): ""What are you looking
for the Devil for, when you ought to be looking for the Lord?""

AFL JoyceM Welcome to the Apple II Music & Sound chat - our discussion will
           be on NoiseTracker - the new FTA music program for the GS.  AFA
           Gene will be our host this evening...Gene, the floor is yours :)

AFA Gene   Hi all... well first I'd like to point out, if y'all aren't aware
           yet, that a spanking new version of NoiseTracker has recently
           been released (9 days ago) and is now available in our New Files
           library. It is version 0.5. I haven't played around with it much
           yet, but it's supposed to fix a lot of the little bugs in 0.3
           (the first version we had online).  NoiseTracker also includes
           the ability to directly import ""modules,"" a term used for a
           certain type of Amiga song file which has become popular among PC
           users using the SoundBlaster sound card.

           Now, via NT, these ""MOD"" files are accessible by the GS. We
           expect to see a lot of activity on this end as far as ports from
           the PC and Amiga go. Note that you should be able to go straight
           to the PC music forum and download any recently uploaded MOD
           songfiles (there was a bug in the first wide release of the PCAO
           software, however, so a bunch of files with dates between around
           March 1991 and September 1991 may not download properly. Note that
           to use these PC MOD files, you'll have to rename the downloaded
           file ""MOD.xxxxxx"" if you want it to show up automatically in NT's
           ""open"" dialog box. (On the PC, all MOD files are named
           ""xxxxxxxx.MOD"" instead.)   Also, if the files are packed with ZIP
           compression, you'll need a program from the Communications Forum
           called AGATE -- it's a terminal program that includes the ability
           to unpack ZIP files.

           Now, I guess the best thing to do would be to talk about our
           favorite songfiles... there have been a few complaints, in fact,
           that people were not being ""descriptive"" enough in their file
           descriptions for uploads in describing the songs.

AFC Eddie  ?

AFA Gene   GA ed

AFC Eddie  Once a MOD file is unpacked with Agate, is a file type change
           needed?

AFA Gene   Nope, since all that NT looks for is the ""MOD."" being the first
           four characters in the filename.

AFC Eddie  OK, Thanks!

Deanna7332 Question...

JonL7      Can you list some of the features of Noisetracker?

AFA Gene   (you don't even need that ""MOD."" if you want to type the name in
           directly.)

Deanna7332 Did any of these mod files have anything to do with FTA's ""Module
           A""

AFA Gene   Sure Jon, right after we answer Deanna's question. Deanna, you
           mean ""Modulae?""

Deanna7332 Yes, that's it.

AFA Gene   Modulae was a demo written by FTA last year. (i'll get to you in a
           sec Doors).  It used SoundSmith v0.95 for all it's music. There
           is no connection between MOD files and Modulae by FTA.

Deanna7332 Throughout the demo it said ""Loading modules""

AFA Gene   Those ""modules"" are not the same as Amiga soundfile ""modules"" --
           you see, what Modulae really was was a ""stringing together"" of a
           bunch of neat little tiny demos that FTA had written. So they
           called each little demo a ""module"" and thus the entire demo as a
           whole, ""Modulae"" (fancy plural of module?)

Deanna7332 Ok I understand.  Thank you. :)

AFL JoyceM Latin, Gene :)

AFA Gene   The term ""MODule"" from the Amiga comes from the idea that all the
           stuff needed to play the songfile (all the instruments + the
           sequence file) are included into one file, the ""module.""

TheDoors1  Gene, I have tried to d/l some recent uploaded MODs in the PC
           music area and still the problem exists.

AFA Gene   As I understand it, the problem was fixed VERY recently (correct
           me on this Joyce) and files uploaded as recently as early
           November still might not work depending on the version of the
           PCAO software that the uploader used.

AFL JoyceM Actually, Gene...I was under the impression that it had been, but
           if Doors is still having a problem, then it must not be fixed.

AFA Gene   What date was the file you tried to d/l, Door?

TheDoors1  umm 11/17, around there

AFA Gene   hmmm.... well i can tell you one thing... if it didn't work, don't
           waste your time again later... the problem is in the Apple
           software's method of d/lling files, and there are no plans to
           upgrade the Apple AO software.

AFL JoyceM I will endeavor to get an answer to that PC downloading
           problem/question :)

ThomasK63  i have a quick question... what can you use to unpack amiga mod
           files? On the PC side, that is.

TheDoors1  Agate Thomas

ELECTMUSIC Doors... what happens on after downloading..

Deanna7332 If it's LZHed you can't unless you have an IBM or
           PC/Transporter.

AFA Gene   If GS-ShrinkIt doesn't have that ability, i don't think there
           exists any such utility on the GS.

TheDoors1  What do you mean Elect?

ELECTMUSIC After you download the file... where do you encounter a problem?

TheDoors1  ok, you know when you download the file and at some point in the
           download the file starts to appear on your screen.  That's when I
           cancel it.

ThomasK63  I am sure soething good can be made w/out resorting to Amiga
           files

AFC Eddie  Yes, Doors, I believe the problem is with the PC software it was
           UL'd with.

TheDoors1  yeah Eddie.

GNO Tim    Amiga MOD files are typically compressed using LHarc.  I've
           uncompressed several on my Unix machine at school.

ThomasK63  good time for someone to make a lharc unpacker...

AFC DYAJim someone might be ;)

GNO Tim    Several people are already

AFC Eddie  Can't wait, Jim!

AFA Gene   Jon, did you have a question?

JonL7      The features of Noisetracker :)

AFA Gene   Oh yes... okay, here goes, in a nutshell, from most important to
           least:


AFA Gene   *  ability to import MOD files

           *  ability to import Soundsmith files

           *  ProDOS 8 based

           *  virtually no editing abilities (not a feature but important to
           know)

AFC DYAJim :)

AFA Gene   *  forgot: and the most important feature of all, the ability to
           hold instrument files in regular system RAM instead of DOC RAM,
           allowing for instruments far beyond the regular 64K limit found
           in ALL other GS music programs.

ThomasK63  I'll buy that!

TheDoors1  I have another question...when you're ready.

AFA Gene   GA Doors

TheDoors1  ok..is it true that NoiseTracker will take in soundsmith files and
           play them more clearly

AFA Gene   Well, as far as ""what you hear,"" yes there is a definite
           difference with some instruments. It does NOT play the sounds
           more ""clearly,"" but it just plays them in a different way. What
           many people seem to like about this ""different way"" is that
           sustained instruments (i.e. instruments designed to be played
           in a loop to simulate a long held note) seem to work better (or
           perhaps simply the way they were originally intended to work).

TheDoors1  I see

Deanna7332 Which takes up more space - MOD or NT  w/soundfile ?

AFA Gene   Deanna, it depends a few things, such as how big the sequence is,
           how many instruments you have, etc. Once you have a lot of
           assorted files, it'll probably average out to be about the same
           give or take a hundred blocks on your HD. So it basically depends
           on whether you prefer to have your instruments separate or not.

Deanna7332 Does playing quality differ with either one ?

AFA Gene   Nope. It's exactly the same either way. Loading time is the same
           too.

AFC Eddie  Can NT save songs as MOD files?

AFA Gene   Nope. It has options for Open and Close module, but these are
           still inactive.

AFA Gene   If there are no more questions, I'd like to talk about which NT
           files out there are the ""hottest,"" since this info could be
           useful to many users who are interested in downloading NT/MOD
           files.

           My personal favorite is ""Lambada,"" which is supplied by FTA with
           the program but is available separately on America
           Online.Everything about this file is really impressive except
           perhaps the sound quality of the horn-ish melody instrument.

           What about y'all, what are your favorite NT files?

AFL JoyceM Gene, there is a classical song for NT, but can't remember the
           name, but it is good.

AFC Eddie  I like Dragnet!

ELECTMUSIC So do I Ed

TheDoors1  I like Seven something

Deanna7332 My most favorite of all mod files is Pleasure Principle

AFC Eddie  <--appreciate's Greg's taste!

AFL JoyceM :)

AFA Gene   Deanna, i assume you got that from a local board?

Deanna7332 I got it from the PC forum here.

TheDoors1  I saw it there also

Deanna7332 I think under ""Pleasure""

AFA Gene   Would you be able to upload it here? If it's really that good, we
           ought to have it available directly in our oun NT lib here (BTW
           folks, we will be releasing a new NoiseTracker software library
           soon!)

AFC Eddie  What a Forum!!!

Deanna7332 That sounds great!

AFL JoyceM Gene, do you think it will be possible for synthLAB files to be
           converted to MOD files?

AFL JoyceM MOD files?

AFA Gene   I doubt it, Joyce. The formats are so diametrically opposed in
           their entire basis of their file formats that it wouldn't be
           worth the time for a programmer to develop such a convertor.

Deanna7332 Isn't it possible to move the mod file from the PC forum to our
           music library?

AFA Gene   But..... it might be worth the time for a MIDI File Format to MOD
           convertor, since these two formats are more widely accepted.

Nuzz       they have nothing better to do Gene

ELECTMUSIC Gene.. some interesting similarities with DTune and NTracker

AFA Gene   They lose the file, tho, Deanna. :)

AFL JoyceM In what way, Greg?

ELECTMUSIC Both Prodos 8

Deanna7332 Shhh they won't know a thing :)

ELECTMUSIC I also believe Bill uses a shuttling of sound data between Doc
           Ram and Ram.

AFC Eddie  Interesting, Greg.

ELECTMUSIC Thats how he gets some of the excellent instrument quality

AFC Eddie  But Diversitune has that one distinction:  MIDI input.

AFL JoyceM Deanna, we would greatly appreciate it if you would upload that
           'Pleasure' song to our library :)

ELECTMUSIC Agreed Ed.. one of the factors FTA doesn't like to incorporate
           into their programs.

Deanna7332 I'll u/l it tonight if possible.

AFL JoyceM Thanks :)

AFC Eddie  Thanks, Deanna!

AFL JoyceM I will send Bill B a copy of NoiseTracker + some MOD files...to
           see what comments we get from him (will send when I get back).

AFC DYAJim What ever happened to that diversitune upgrade that was talked
           about ?

ELECTMUSIC That would be interesting Joyce

AFC Eddie  Bill apparently still working on it, Jim.

ELECTMUSIC I am sure he would appreciate the Prodos 8

AFC DYAJim good..

AFL JoyceM Jim...RSN....he was hoping by Christmas (this year), but he is
           soooo busy with his job, who knows?

AFC DYAJim Oh yeah, I noticed the speed calcuation in NT .5 is inaccurate
           :)

AFC DYAJim I recall he has set a lot of Christmas projected dates :)

ELECTMUSIC He was one of the first ""Free Tools"" experts in breaking all the
           rules for economic sake.

AFC DYAJim like for the vaporware DT inst editor like 2 years ago.

Deanna7332 Are there any Christmas Mod or NT songs?

AFC Eddie  Oh yeah, Diversi-Editor!

AFL JoyceM I know, Jim - but that I know he has been working on.

AFC DYAJim he projected Christmas for it, and it never came :)

AFA Gene   Not yet in AMS, but hopefully the Holiday Contest will change all
           that. :)

AFC DYAJim I look foreward to any upgrades..

AFL JoyceM Not that I am aware of Deanna - you have some?  hint, hint

Deanna7332 Nope sorry.  I was hoping there were some that could be u/led
           here

AFC DYAJim I'll be breaking out the xmas tune book rsn.. I should be able to
           midi a few :) (which rules out nt)

AFL JoyceM Question...

AFC Eddie  It would be more appropriate to have a converter from Appleworks
           spreadsheet to MOD than from MIDI!

AFL JoyceM If I got ahold of an Amiga song (MOD) disk...how would I convert
           them for here?

AFA Gene   You mean an Amiga-formatted disk?

AFL JoyceM Yes

AFC DYAJim Ack.. methinks you need an amiga and a null modem cable or a
           modem.

AFA Gene   Methinks Jim is right

AFC DYAJim LOL!!  Design your music in the spreadsheet then import to NT :)
           IT might actually have better editing?!! :)

AFC Eddie  Right!

AFL JoyceM Me thinks he is right.  If I had them upload to me, would that
           work?

AFA Gene   Yep; should work like a charm.

AFC DYAJim Yah.. as long as they're coming from an amiga

AFL JoyceM Great....I will work on that when I get back  (making note now).

AFL JoyceM Gene, will you get some of those files (NT) sent to that area
           tonight?  If so, I will leave the needed message :)

AFA Gene   That's all I have planned for tonight's chat, Joyce. Yep, I'll
           move some files right now.

AFL JoyceM Thanks...

AFL JoyceM Then we should have our NoiseTracker Library by end of the week in
           AMS :)

ELECTMUSIC Gene... quick question:  Are you launching NTracker from a 3.5
           disk?

AFL JoyceM Okay, guys...I will see you all the week of December 11th (may the
           4th) as I am off on vacation.

AFA Gene   Yep greg

AFC JohnC  Where are you going?

ELECTMUSIC Do you encounter out of memory problems

AFL JoyceM Night all...and Gene, thanks for an excellent chat and great
           explanations of NoiseTracker.

Nuzz       Joyce, I have good news for FutureSound owners. SoundConvert will
           support it in the first release

AFC Eddie  Great, Mike!

AFA Gene   Greg, i always keep my RAMdisk at 0 when using noisetracker. Not
           only are

AFC JohnC  Mike...SoundConvert...released?

AFL JoyceM Great, Mike.  When can we get SoundConvert, Mike? and FutureSound
           :)

AFA Gene   there a couple of bugs with memory management, but if you're
           loading in a MOD file that's really big, NT will eat your RAMdisk.

AFC Eddie  Sounds good.

Nuzz       The manual is being ""layout"". Release date should be about 1st
           week of Dec

ELECTMUSIC Tnxs Gene

AFC JohnC  YES.......WTG Nuzz!!!!!!!!

Deanna7332 Yes, why is there on some MOD files a stop somewhere in the middle
           ?

Deanna7332 That's really frustrating!

AFL JoyceM Mike, leave me E-Mail on when and how I can send your the $$ to

    John Michael Osbourne, (known as ""Ozzy"" to his fans), has in his long 
career as vocalist for Black Sabbath had his work with the group misconstrued 
as advocating Satanism.  In a 1983 radio special featuring Ozzy, the 
interviewer expressed precisely this point; ""...Ozzy has always been shrouded 
in the darkest of Satanic imagery.  Yet if you really listen to his music, 
you'll find that what he is saying differs greatly from his image....""(1)  Even 
the group's image has often been described as ""occult and diabolic"".(2)

    The important point to remember here is to differentiate between appearance 
and reality.  Although the name ""Black Sabbath"" conjures up images of witches 
and sorcerers paying homage to Satan for the powers bestowed upon them, this 
does not make it safe to assume that the group that went by this name 
necessarily drew the inspiration from the occult.(3)  The closest they ever 
came to it was a gothic horror film featuring Boris Karloff as narrator; they 
adopted their name directly from the name of this film.(4)  Black Sabbath was 
involved in the black arts as much as Karloff practiced casting spells off-
screen.  Tony Iommi, the group's guitarist, summed it up best when he described 
the group as having basically ""...the same appeal as a horror movie.  It's all 
an act.""(5)










    Just as their film counterpart did, Ozzy and Sabbath found the occult 
mythos to be an effective vehicle for powerful social commentary; particularly 
when put in the context of heavy-metal rock and roll.  Ozzy himself noted that 
there are ""...people who pick up my [album] cover[s] and go...'This guy's got 
to be singing about Devil, doom, death and destruction.'  Which is not the 
case....""(6)

    The late Lester Bangs likened the group to Bob Dylan and William Burroughs, 
describing them all as ""...moralists...trying to deal with a serious present 
situation in an honest way....""(7)  Ozzy and Black Sabbath merely bring to 
light the many evils of our world in their work, to try and make us realize 
that we are all victim to their influence.  They hope to make us recognize 
these evils so that we may take up arms against them; a point Ozzy emphatically 
stresses:  ""...one thing everybody has got to understand about Black Sabbath's 
lyrics.  They're not downer lyrics, they're just telling everybody where it's 
at...""(8)  He also cites the group's most controversial tune, ""Black Sabbath"", 
as a response to the ignorant hippie culture still force when the tune was 
written in 1970:  ""The hippies said: 'The world is beautiful man.' (sic)  You 
only had to look around you to see how crappy it was.  It was ridiculous 
listening to that stuff, let alone playing it, so we just wrote about the world 
the way it really was and how it affected us - and we felt better in ourselves 
because we were really being honest....""(9)

    I   1   HAVE YOU EVER THOUGH ABOUT YOUR SOUL-
        2   CAN IT BE SAVED?
        3   OR PERHAPS YOU THINK THAT WHEN YOU ARE DEAD
        4   YOU JUST STAY IN YOUR GRAVE.
        5   IS GOD JUST A THOUGHT WITHIN YOUR HEAD OR IS
        6   HE A PART OF YOU?
        7   IS CHRIST JUST A NAME THAT YOU READ IN A BOOK
        8   WHEN YOU WERE AT SCHOOL?

    II  9   WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT DEATH DO YOU LOSE
        10  YOUR BREATH OR DO YOU KEEP YOUR COOL?
        11  WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE THE POPE ON THE END
        12  OF A ROPE - DO YOU THINK HE'S A FOOL?
        13  WELL I'VE SEEN THE TRUTH - YES I'VE SEEN 
        14  THE LIGHT AND I'VE CHANGED MY WAYS.
        15  AND I'LL BE PREPARED WHEN YOU'RE LONELY 
        16  AND SCARED AT THE END OF OUR DAYS.

    III 17  COULD IT BE YOU'RE AFRAID OF WHAT YOU'R
        18  FRIENDS MIGHT SAY 
        19  IF THEY NEW YOU BELIEVED IN GOD ABOVE
        20  THEY SHOULD REALISE BEFORE THE CRITICISE
        21  THAT GOD IS THE ONLY WAY TO LOVE.

    IV  23  IS YOUR MIND SO SMALL THAT YOU HAVE TO FALL
        24 IN WITH THE PACK WHEREVER THEY RUN
        25  WILL YOU STILL SNEER WHEN DEATH IS NEAR
        26  AND SAY THEY MAY AS WELL WORSHIP THE SUN.

    V   27  I THINK IT WAS TRUE IT WAS PEOPLE LIKE YOU
        28  THAT CRUCIFIED CHRIST
        29  I THINK IT IS SAD THE OPINION YOU HADE WAS THE
        30  ONLY ONE VOICED.
        31  WILL YOU BE SO SURE WHEN YOUR DAY IS NEAR
        32  SAY YOU DON'T BELIEVE?
        33  YOU HAD THE CHANCE BUT YOU TURNED IT DOWN
        34  NOW YOU CAN'T RETRIEVE.










    VI  35  PERHAPS YOU'LL THINK BEFORE YOU SAY THAT
        36  GOD IS DEAD AND GONE
        37  OPEN YOUR EYES, JUST REALIZE THAT HE IS THE
        38  ONE.
        39  THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN SAVE YOU KNOW FROM
        40  ALL THIS SIN AND HATE.
        41  OR WILL YOU STILL JEER AT ALL YOU HEAR?
        42  YES!-I THINK IT'S TOO LATE.

    In this piece, the group asserts a belief in an afterlife and spiritual 
redemption.  As grisly as the image of a hanged pontiff is, its shock value is 
a necessary part of the message:  They reject religious dogma, stating that a 
belief in God, in one's own heart, is the only guiding light to help one inn 
his life (lines 11/12, 39/40).  Furthermore, the reject religious hypocrisy 
(lines 5/6, 7/8) and peer pressure (verses III, IV) as excuses for not 
accepting God.  To clarify further:  following the crowd does not justify 
shrugging responsibility for one's own actions.

    After re-reading, it becomes obvious that this song is an ascerbic critique 
of atheism; (line 35/36) I refer here again to verses three and four.  In these 
two verses, the picture painted in one of Godless conformity and how it's 
viewed as being as foolish as Paganism.  These lyrics set an example for the 
listener by relating personal experience (lines 13-16).  However, for those who 
cannot accept this the group has no recourse but to condemn them, although 
rather ironically; they hope that their rhetorical loss of faith in the 
listener will open his eyes (line 42).

            WHAT IS THIS, THAT STANDS BEFORE ME?
            FIGURE IN BLACK, WHICH POINTS AT ME
            TURN ROUND QUICK AND START TO RUN
            FIND OUT I'M THE CHOSEN ONE.  OH, NO!
            
            BIG BLACK SHAPE WITH EYES OF FIRE
            TELLING PEOPLE THEIR DESIRE
            SATAN'S SITTING THERE, HE'S SMILING
            WATCHES THOSE FLAMES GET HIGHER AND HIGHER
            OH, NO, NO, -- PLEASE GOD HELP ME!
            
                IS THIS THE END MY FRIEND?
                SATAN'S COMING 'ROUND THE BEND
                PEOPLE RUNNING 'CAUSE THEY'RE SCARED
                THE PEOPLE BETTER GO AND BEWARE
                NO, NO!  PLEASE--NO!!
                
                
    The all time controversy winner!  Is this not irrefutably  THE song about 
Black Magic in rock?  It's all so obvious, suffuse with evil imagery; Satan, 
walls of flame, figure in black, and damnation at the end.  Yes, I see the 
images too; it definitely concerns Black Magic.  Then again, Shakespeare's 
Macbeth employed scenes of witches involved in conjurations; does that mean 
that Shakespeare was a warlock?  Poe used to write sardonic tragedies about 
twisted murderers and the bizarre nature of acts, did that make him an evil, 
leering, demented killer?  Did either of them advocated what they wrote about?  
One has to remember that writing about something is not necessarily the same as 
emulating it.  Tony Iommi spoke out quite strongly about this:  ""People are 
bringing us down saying that we are a Black Magic group.  I think they must be










getting mixed up with Black Widow.  We don't do any sacrifices on stage, and 
we're not on a black magic kick.  We wanted to do heavy numbers and the guitar 
riffs we worked out were more suited to evil things than love.  We play songs 
about black magic, but they are more likely to be against than for it.""(12)  

    By now, you're probably asking yourself who Black Widow is, right?  Then 
it's time for a little history:

        Sabbath, before they were known as Sabbath, had the same line-up but 
two earlier names.  The first one was Polka Tulk, which seemed sure to doom 
them to obscurity.(13)  The soon realized this and changed the group's name to 
Earth.  Now, Earth was a blues band at the end of the English blues boom.  As 
if that wasn't bad enough, they soon discovered that not only was there another 
group named Earth, but they had also released a single.  To avoid confusion, 
they changed their name again.(14)  But what made them decide on that name?  
Just ask Ozzy:  ""I just liked the name Black Sabbath because of the succession 
of vowel sounds.(15)  If that sounds ludicrous just consider this:  Sabbath was 
""...the first of the really committed, loud and heavy bands...""(16)  They 
needed a name to match the gut-wrenching power they were developing.  Tony knew 
that he wanted Sabbath to be noticed above all the rest of the British blues 
bands:  ""We wanted something of our own that we'd like and people would like.  
And we wanted something loud!""










    Tony didn't hate the blues.  He'd cut his teeth as a guitarist on the likes 
of The Shadows, Buddy Holly and Django Rheinhardt, developing his own style 
from there.  But he realized the group had no future in the blues:

        'We couldn't keep playing 12-bars forever.  We just got fed up with 
Earth music.  It was jazz, blues stuff.  It was good for practice but nothing 
else.'

    In the late 'Sixties, blues groups were a dime a dozen in Birmingham and 
interest was waning in the blues boom due to the glut of groups.  One man, by 
the name of Jim Simpson, had heard Earth around the Birmingham club circuit and 
understood what they were trying to do.  He decided to take them under his 
wing.  With the aid of his massive record collection, Jim expanded the group's 
horizons in the areas of jazz and blues.  He introduced them to artists like 
Wes Montgomery, Count Basie and Jimmy Rushing.  It was from Rushing in 
particular that they derived the repetitive riff style so readily noticeable in 
their later incarnation as Black Sabbath.

    The Count Basie influence is evidenced in the song ""Wicked World"" from the 
first album; Sabbath drummer Bill Ward uses a ""'sighing hi-hat'...in the manner 
of Basie's drummer Jo Jones.""










    The influence is subtle, almost subliminal.  Yet it is one which was not 
thought capable of hard, 'heavy' rock bands in the late 'Sixties.  Although Led 
Zeppelin and Jimi Hendrix also had their work steeped in blues and jazz 
derivations (Hendrix' ""Third Stone From the Sun"" and Zeppelin's version of 
Willie Dixon's ""I Can't Quit You Baby"" from their first album), neither was 
able to match the intense energy of Black Sabbath.  Iommi has always had a 
preference for music with an original, distinct style of its' own; as an 
example, he mentions guitarists Joe Pass and Alvin Lee as two of his strongest 
songwriting influences.

    It would also be necessary that Sabbath develop a unique, distinctive style 
and image of their own.  Though they had changed their name from Earth to Black 
Sabbath to avoid confusion with the other Earth; at the same time another group 
emerged by the name of Black Widow ""...who WERE profoundly influenced by the 
occult, had a male witch as a patron, and wrote pieces like ""Come to The 
Sabbat.""  Unfortunately, Sabbath was constantly reaping the benefits of Widow's 
publicity.

    Sabbath was a group that never minced words.  If they saw something as 
destructive, they would be sure to rub the listener's face it it.  They did not 
want their point to be missed.

    With their straightforward, sometimes brutal way of looking at things, they 
try to shock the listener's conscience back into awareness.  The imagery of 
""Hand of Doom"", from the Paranoid album, is candid and condemning; it is a 
strong statement against drug addiction and rightly so...

            IT'S TO LATE TOO TURN
            YOU DON'T WANNA LEARN
            PRICE OF LIFE YOU CRY
            NOW YOU'RE GONNA DIE
            
            
    Many people felt the group's overall direction was pessimistic and had a 
negative effect on its listener's due to that.  ""Ozzy insisted that if people 
thought he was having a bad effect on the minds of young kids, they should go 
and watch the TV news where real murder and mayhem were a way of life, and 
shown night after night."" (18)

    Sabbath was never negative in their message; they were simply truthful 
about waht they saw as wrong in the world.  If you ""Strip away the horror 
stories, the imagery and the hysteria, (and) turn down the amps a notch...you 
have a well-rehearsed, solid blues and rock band, powered by a dedication to 
well defined objectives.""  On the top of the list of those objectives was 
truth; Sabbath never feared facing that truth squarely, regardless of what many 
people thought of them.

Long, long, time ago,
I can still remember,
When the local calls were ""free"".
And I knew if I paid my bill,
And never wished them any ill,
That the phone company would let me be...

But Uncle Sam said he knew better,
Split 'em up, for all and ever!
We'll foster competition:
It's good capital-ism!

I can't remember if I cried,
When my phone bill first tripled in size.
But something touched me deep inside,
The day... Bell System... died.

And we were singing...

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

Is your office Step by Step,
Or have you gotten some Crossbar yet?
Everybody used to ask...
Oh, is TSPS coming soon?
IDDD will be a boon!
And, I hope to get a Touch-Tone phone, real soon...

The color phones are really neat,
And direct dialing can't be beat!
My area code is ""low"":
The prestige way to go!

Oh, they just raised phone booths to a dime!
Well, I suppose it's about time.
I remember how the payphones chimed,
The day... Bell System... died.

And we were singing...

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

Back then we were all at one rate,
Phone installs didn't cause debate,
About who'd put which wire where...
Installers came right out to you,
No ""phone stores"" with their ballyhoo,
And 411 was free, seemed very fair!

But FCC wanted it seems,
To let others skim long-distance creams,
No matter 'bout the locals,
They're mostly all just yokels!

And so one day it came to pass,
That the great Bell System did collapse,
In rubble now, we all do mass,
The day... Bell System... died.

So bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

I drove on out to Murray Hill,
To see Bell Labs, some time to kill,
But the sign there said the Labs were gone.
I went back to my old CO,
Where I'd had my phone lines, years ago,
But it was empty, dark, and ever so forlorn...

No relays pulsed,
No data crooned,
No MF tones did play their tunes,
There wasn't a word spoken,
All carrier paths were broken...

And so that's how it all occurred,
Microwave horns just nests for birds,
Everything became so absurd,
The day... Bell System... died.

So bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

We were singing:

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
                             *                          

                   THE REAL OLD TIME RELIGION
                   tune: ""Old Time Religion""

       (Chorus): Give me that real old time religion (3X)
                 It's good enough for me!

We will have a mighty orgy        We will sacrifice to Yuggoth
in the honour of Astarte          we will sacrifice to Yuggoth
it'll be a mighty party           Burn a candle for Yog-Soggoth
and it's good enough for me!      and the Goat With a Thousand Young!

We will all be saved by Mithras       If your rising sign is Aries
We will all be saved by Mithras       You'll be taken by the Fairies
slay the Bull and play the zithras    Meet the Buddah in Benares

                                             IMPERIUM COMPOUND    
                                             (Atenveldt Verses)

   Now here's a story, a little bit gory,
   A little bit happy, a little bit sad.
   About a drink called Imperium Compound
   And how the SCA's been had!                       

   Chorus: Oh we think, we think, we think,
           The King is a fink, a fink, a fink,
           A figure of respectability
           Rules the Kingdom thru Imperium Compound
           The results are plain to see!

   Mongol Hordemen, those free-living swordsmen
   Subverting the Kingdoms from underneath!
   Have no use for Imperium Compound
   Except perhaps to brush their teeth!

   AltChorus: Oh we fink, we fink, we fink,
              The Khan and the Kink, the Kink, the Kink,
              And the Board, their Great Senilities!
              The Western Irgun, drinks Imperium Compound
              And we're BACK, with results you'll see!    

   Lady Laurel, with Authority Royal,
   Passes and rejects our heraldry
   She needs a swig of Imperium Compound
   Then perhaps she'd deign to talk to me!            

   Lady Trude thought it her duty
   To turn a social wrong into a Right
   Proved her point with Imperium Compound
   And showed that Cheshire Cats can fight!  //and scratch//

   The Board of Directors styled themselves The Electors
   And another con they tried to swing
   Now the BoD drinks Imperium Compound
   So we no longer need a King!                        

   AltChorus: Oh the Bod, the BoD, the BoD,
              It thinks it is God, is God, is God,
              The figure of Supreme Authority!
              And if we O.D.'d on Imperium Compund
              there'd be no need for Royalty!          

   Oh, MEDIEVAL Net, we thought it was all wet
   With witty remarks, and other kinds of sass
   We'll feed our computers on Imperium Compound
   And BYTE the BoD right on its' righteous ass!         

   Good old Duncan was often drunken
   Chasing all the ladies fair
   He bathed himself in Imperium Compound
   Now he has a little savoir faire!                     

                    (more)


  ATEN IMPERIUM (cont.)

   Ioseph of Locksley, never changes his socks, he
   Runs around looking like a Cavalier,
   He stocked up on Imperium Compound
   And he has enough to last for years and years!        

   AltChorus: Oh they forgot, forgot, forgot
              The Locks-e-ly Plot, the Plot, the Plot!
              And it works the best when it is underground!
              It isn't a hassle for a green-and-white tassle
              They're the ones that BREW Imperium Compound!  

   Trelon of the Wood, he was very good, he
   Was a leader that had never been beat before;
   But Caid had Imperium Compound,
   And Imperial Roman Caid won the War!  //with help!//   

   In Tyr Ysgithr, it's regularly whispered there
   That the Kingdom is ruled over by a King    // What's THAT? //
   They're ""democratic"" and quite erratic....
   They've forgot the purpose of the whole damn thing!     

   King Sir Mark von, with his pretty white suit on,
   Rules the Kingdom both with Grace and Purity!
   He never touches Imperium Compound
   At least not where anyone else can see!               

   Duke Sir Deaton, was never beaten
   On the field, or in the drinking hall;
   At the Catbox War with Caid,
   Left thirty bodies piled against the wall!             

   Denis O'Titans was good at smitin'
   A Locksley Monster in every single way!
   Drank a little Imperium Compound
   And ATE Deaton's sword that day  // No! REALLY! //

                          WTP-0002C

        Last night I had the strangest dream in this bleak century
        I dreamed that people the world around believed in Chivalry

        I dreamed I saw a Kingly Crown enshrined in laurel leaves
        with Grace and Joy and Purity attendant at his feet

        I dreamed I saw the perfect Knight receive his accolade
        and minstrels sang and children laughed in some soft forest glade

        I dreamed I saw the finest thing that ever man could make
        grow great and strong and undefiled: Pray God I never wake!

        Last night I had the strangest dream in this bleak century
        I dreamed that people the world around believed in Chivalry

               (to the tune of ""Good King Wenceslaus"")

                Locksley Monsters never yield
                on the field of battle
                strike the helm and bash the shield
                make their eyeteeth rattle
                Bodies on the ground will lie
                bones will burst in sunder
                search for Locksleys' enemies:

                              SONG OF IVANOF

            There is a man who we know well that does the best he can
            but he's displayed in armour made of reticulated garbage cans!

            He looks so fine and fair and strong, oh how he plays the man
            and how it's prized, those galvanized, reticulated garbage cans

            The noblest Roman of them all, a good Praetorian
            a combatant who wears no pants, judst reticulated garbage cans!

            Like old Horatius at the Bridge, like the Legions of Valerian
            (O dearie me: those LOVELY knees!)
            and those reticulated garbage cans!

                        THE HERALDS SAID TO ME

                         C. McCray Bethancourt

         (sung to the tune (obviously) of the 12 Days of Christmas)


1.           The first time I sent my device, The Heralds said to me

            ""It violates the Rule of Three""

2.           The next time I tried it, the Heralds said to me

            ""We changed the forms, and it violates the Rule of
             Three"".

3.           The third time I tried, and the Heralds said to me, 

            ""We upped the fees, we changed the forms, and it
             violates the Rule of Three"".

4.           Another time I tried and the Heralds said to me,
 
            ""We haven't got it, we upped the fees, we changed the 
             forms, and it violates the Rule of Three"".

5.           The fifth time I tried it, the Heralds said to me,  

            ""In a decision rendered by the College of Arms on
             August 1st, A.S. V it was decided that this style of
             heraldic design was not appropriate to the aims and 
             intentions of the Corporate Body. Holy! Holy! Holy! ""

 note: verse 5 is delivered in an extremely fast, mono-
       tone, similiar to a Gregorian Chant.

           "" ....we haven't got it, we upped the fees, we changed the forms,
             and it violates the Rule of Three.""

6.           I tried it a sixth time, and the Heralds said to me,

            ""We changed the rules, &c""

7.           A seventh time I tried and, the Heralds said to me,

            ""It's against the Rule of Tincture, we changed the
             rules, &c""

8.           I tried it once again and the heralds said to me,

            ""It's not a Period design, It's against the Rule of Tincture, We
             changed the rules, &c""

                                * more *



    Heralds Said To Me (cont.)

9.           I sent it in once more, and the Heralds said to me,

            ""We changed the rules again, It's not a Period design,
             it's against the Rule of Tincture, we changed the
             rules, &c""

10. (sung in cold anger)
             The LAST time I sent my device, the Heralds said to me

    (sung in a state of SMUG)
             ""Someone else has got it, &c""




              (nb: every single one of these reasons has been used by the
              CoA, at one point or another, to reject perfectly good
              heraldry, along with some even MORE stupid.  If the shoe 
              fits....................!!!!!!!!)

           or: Who was that Vermin I saw you with last, Knight?
   or: There may be Lice on all you Knice, but there ain't no Lice on me

           Once there was a Barony howling in the wilderness
           nestled in the Valley where the River doesn't flow
           and the folks were driven buggy by the insects in the Revel Hall
           Authenticity is wonderful, but this doesn't go!

                   Bugs on the Baroness, bugs on the Baroness!
                   That was the cry that you heard all the day
                   and the scratching can be heard from Ysgithr to Ered Sul
                   why did we come here? Let's go away!

           See them all a scratching, nestled in their armour tight
           the fleas have a melee team that's challenging the field!
           call Truly Nolen! Someone's gotta help us out!
           the crabs are nesting in our helms but we'll never yield!

                   (chorus)

           Dawn comes a-breaking, the bugs have won the Coronet...
           flea-infested Conan-clones in piles upon the lawn
           where is the Barony? The bugs have eaten everyone...
           termites got the stick-jocks, and all their sticks are gone!

                   (chorus)

                  For all the Lands where I have dwelt
                  Oh Atenveldt, Oh Atenveldt
                  till rivers burn and mountains melt
                  lest I forget my Atenveldt
                  From deserts stark to snow-capped peaks
                  from silent lakes and laughing creeks
                  sing: Oh let man find his heart's ease
                  on rocky plains
                  in desert breeze

                  For oft I thought of mighty men
                  who carved a Land with sword and pen
                  and lit a candle, burning bright,
                  that pierced the darkness; stirred the night!
                  tho some are gone their deeds remain
                  this sunny Crown without a stain
                  sing: Oh, their deeds were not in vain!
                  in sunlit days
                  and falling rain.....

                  So raise your banners, blazoned bright
                  Advance the Dream and Shine the Light!
                  in battle's crash and Revel's song
                  raise high the Flag and wave it long!
                  For all the Lands wherein I've dwelt
                  I love you best, my Atenveldt!
                  Sing: Oh the Joy that I have felt!
                  My Atenveldt
                  My Atenveldt

      What the use of wearing panties
      whalebone corsets of your Auntie's
      boxer shorts and other scanties
      best of all is nude
      there's such fun in going bra-less
      now that it's no longer lawless
      'specially if your figure's flawless
      best of all is nude
      nude is what you're born in
      shirts are never torn in
      underwear and lacy flimsies, garter belts and other whimsies
      yards of itchy cloth to put your form in
      ducks all do it, maidens rue it
      even ancient Picts in Britain blue it
      going naked's how to do it
      best of all is nude!

      If your garters aren't elastic
      tie them up in knots fantastic
      (panty hose is something drastic!)
      best of all is nude!
      If you're tired of wearing clotheses
      shed your garment 'mongst the roses
      never mind the old bluenoses
      best of all is nude!
      Nude is best for ducking!
      Worst for horses bucking!
      Moonlit nights will see such sights
          that are very best for fooling round
                              .....and elbows!
      Nudity is grand to see
       a well-known antidote to virginity
      take your clothes off and you'll see:
      best of all is nude!

                   once I talked to a great Grey Man
                   spun three times and said with a sigh
                   hadn't been for the Runes had his other eye!

                   Hi said the Lady, dressed in green
                   prettiest thing I've ever seen
                   she went down underneath the hill
                   and came back out of her own free will

                   Brian Boru, on Irish ground
                   walked three times the Island round
                   Norsemen came lookin for a fight
                   just another Irish Saturday night!

                   Hi said Lugh on the banquest night
                   a poet and a player and a good wheelwright
                   a harper and a warrior and none the least:
                   a Druid and he got in to the Feast!

                   Harold Haardrada's face was red!
                   Came to Britain and he wound up dead
                   Stamford Bridge is where he's found
                   got six feet of English ground

                   the Legion with it's Eagles bright
                   marched into the Pictish night
                   met them there upon the sand
                   gave em up to the Wicker Man!

                   eight-legged steed and hound of Hel
                   the one-eyed Man, he loves ya well
                   fire burn and fire spark
                   are you then feared of the dark?

                   The Circle forms, the Circle flows
                   the Circle goes where no man knows
                   Hail to the Lady, one in three:
                   Present is Past and Past is Me!

                   Rhiannon's Birds are still in flight
                   all thru the Day all thru the Night

                   Hi said the Lady dressed in white
                   sang the Day and sang the Night
                   sang the Land and sang the Sea
                   sang the Song, and then sang Me!

                                  came the Lady to the lea
                                  Sword and Roses in Her Hand
                                  spread their seeds thruout the Land

                                  saw the Lady where she stood
                                  by the fire burning bright
                                  came to know his heart's delight!

                   Present is Past and Past is WE

                   By Oak and Ash and Holy Thorn

                    WEAPONS AT THE DOOR

 Being a Polemic concerning the alleged Custom of the West Kingdom concerning 
 checking your Weapons at the Door of the Revel Hall. As the Satire is the 
 Weapon of the Bard, this said Polemic is to be checked at the Door, along with 
 swords, knives, redheaded Ladies and other such Deadly Things.....

         As I roved out to Western Lands to take the Western Air
         I went into a Revel Hall and I saw a Twelfth Night there
         but I was halted at the gate by a Privy Consellor
                 (that's the man who tells the King of the West how to go to
                  the bath room!)
         who told me I would have to check my Weapons at the door

         As I, in my astonishment, stood hung on tenter-pegs
         a Knight came in whose Prouess hung down between his legs
         the Doorman grabbed a greatsword and he struck the Knight full sore
         and gave him a reciept; he left his weapon at the door!

         a Bard was next whose goodly Voice has entertained us all
         but he, too, was prevented from entering the Hall
         and told he could not carry deadly weapons on the floor
         he left his Voice and Harp among the weapons at the door

         a Master entered graciously, a man we all know well
         who holds a 3rd Dan Black Belt, tho this he'd never tell
         the Master struggled valiantly, the Master cursed and swore
         but he left his hands, and feet, as weapons at the door

         the company was jovial, altho a bit dismayed
         for lack of proper cutlery, down to the smallest blade
         for even teeth and fingernails, each can be used in War
         were cut, and pulled, and left behind, as weapons at the door!

         And has their King not loyal Knights that He must be afraid
         of brawling in his Hall and of Assassin's bloody blade?
         the Rights of Men to carry Arms at least WE'VE not foreswore
         and a POX on them that made the Rule of Weapons at the Door!

                           THE STREETS OF ANN ARBOR

               As I walked out thru the streets of Ann Arbor
               as I walked out thru Ann Arbor one day
               I spied a young Mongol all dressed in white linen
               all dressed in white linen and cold as the clay

               I then spied another, done in on the sidewalk
               along with just about six dozen more
               their wounds were all gaping, from mace and from braoadsword
               from claymore and cannon, all dripping with gore

               what caused this grave carnage, I cried to the Monglos
               oh pray what's the reason for this awful sight
               my answer came slowly from under the corpse-pile
               ""It seems that our bark is much worse than our bite.....""

               the answer continued from pale lips a-shaking
               we sang all our songs and believed them as true
               the Dark Horde could never be beaten in battle
               we thought this was what all good Mongols could do...

               we went down to Atenveldt all for to plunder
               ""too large to defend"" was our song every night
               but Atenveldt's different from East, West or Middle
               there, even the bushes have learned how to bite!

               the Clann stole our ponies, the Scraelings our foodstuffs
               we ran into axes in AtenViking hands
               our maidens ran off with one Richard of Arkham
               and we're all that's left to return to our lands

               MacChluarains and Monsters, Lockehaven and Foxmoor
               that Kingdom is BIG and its' fighters are MEAN!
               we fought and we lost, and fled back to Ann Arbor
               we all came back home with results that you've seen

               keep away from that Land with its' cactus and marshes
               it's no place for Mongols who are bent on War
               they count their blows well, but they strick them yet better
               he crawled into his Yurt, and fell, dead, on the floor.....

                       SONG OF THE THREE
             copyright 1981 W. J. Bethancourt III
                            C. A. Bethancourt III
       tune: the song of the Cowardly Lion, Tin Woodsman and Scarecrow
             in the movie version of the Wizard of Oz

        (Enter the Scarecrow, who singeth:)

        My wife is always nagging; my Prowess it is lagging
        I can't do anything
        she has got a reason, but revenge is out of season
        Oh I wish I could be King!

        If I just had the Crown on, I'd always have a frown on
        and the Barons on a string
        Heads they would be rolling, the Board would be cajoling
        Oh if only I was King!

        I am very fed up with the way this group is set up
        Oh I'd change everything!
        they are so high and mighty with the way that they do fight-ey
        Oh, someday I'll be King!

        Tho my wife is melancholic, and very...vitriolic
        she's a wasp without a sting!
        I'd have to supervise her with a pack of tranquilizers
        If I only was a King......

        (the Tin Woodsman joineth him, and singeth:)

        I grew up kind of cocky, and rather big, and stocky
        and straight as any rod
        on the field I'm a battallion, with the Ladies I'm a stallion
        ...Oh they'd better make me God!

        The other boys are jealous they say I'm over-zealous
        they'd do better to applaud
        the things that I am giving to this Dream that we are living
        oh I wish they'd make me God!

        They say that I'm conceited, but I'm just badly treated
        by people and by BoD
        just think of what they're missing by My Majesty dismissing
        Oh they'd better make me God!

        (the Cowardly Lion creepeth forth, and singeth:)

        Oh I could be a fighter, a great and mighty smiter
        and be the perfect knight
        it's a great and nasty shame, and everyone's to blame
        oh I wish that I could fight!

        Song of the Three (cont.)

        I could be a Cavalier drinking wine and ale and beer
        and be a gorgeous sight
        but it would cost me too much money so it isn't very funny
        oh I wish that I could fight!                               

        Let me at 'em on the field, I would surely make them yield
        to my Power and my Might
        with rattan, shinai and rapier they would nevermore escape here
        If they'd only let me fight

        (all doeth the Softe Shoe off, stage left)

                She was afraid to come out to the Tourney
                She was worried that ""something might show..""
                She was afraid to come out to the Tourney
                And the poor thing did NOT want to go...

                  (2 - 3 - 4, tell the people what she wore!)

                  It was an itsy bitsy teeny weenie little rabbit fur bikini

                  An itsy bitsy teenie weenie little rabbit fur bikini
                  And in her apartment she wanted to stay!

                One day in the Kingdom of the Middle
                It happened at a Tourney one day:
                The Mongols invaded the Middle
                But the Middle did not want to play...

                  (eins - zwei - drei, but the Dark Horde wouldn't die!)

                  It was an itsy bitsy tiny teenie Nauseating Mongol weenie

          Some folks call me many names, others call me crazy
          Tom O'Bedlam's son am I, for my mind is hazy!
          I'd rather sing a song than work (if it's not too phrasey!)
          Lengthy rhymes don't bother me....truth to tell: I'm lazy!

          Yang, your yurt is very nice, and your Horde is smelly,
          And I'm sure that yak-meat will nicely fill one's belly!
          But remember this one line, or you're not worth jelly:
          FIRST you plunder, THEN you burn! That's how to be rakehelly!

          My Lady Lorelei your eyes do drive me to distraction
          And the lovely Care-Cheri causes....petrifaction!
          But I, and they, quite taken are, so I can't take action...
          Therefore, Ladies, fill my cup; I'll drink to stupefaction!

          Now Atenveldt your fighters, all, are most good and gentle
          And the Ladies, bless 'em all, are most ornamental!
          But that little Nikki-Toad....has me sentimental
          Though with boffer in her hand she is argumental!

          This stupid little song, m'lords, is mostly sung in Latin
          By the Goliards, of course, from vespers clear to matins!
          But I prefer a coarser cloth over silk or satins
          English is more understood, mine enemies to flatten!

          Good People all, I've made my Song, its' music's well-recited
          But my voice could use some work; the flowers it has blighted!
          It's rude and rusty, grim and bad, and squeaky like a door-hinge,
          But I'm a better Bard than you: I found a rhyme for ""orange!""

                      by William Poundstone
                              1983

     Two mentalities are at work here: 1960s rock fans and 1980s
fundamentalist Christians. The idea of phonographically concealed
messages dates from the Paul McCartney death scare of 1969. For
hard-core types, the secret-message rumors never really died. Avid
rock fans have auditioned ever album release since the late 1960s
for hidden nuances. Backward messages, barely audible messages,
and messages on one stereo track only have been alleged. At the
other end of the sociosensual spectrum, fundamentalist Christians
have gotten into the act. TV programs such as PRAISE THE LORD and
THE 700 CLUB have propagated rumors of a satanic plot in the
recording industry, no less, in which various albums conceal
""backward-masked"" demonic murmurings. If THAT sounds too spacey to
be taken seriously, consider that it was the fundamentalist groups
who were behind House Resolution 6363, a bill introduced in the
U.S. House of Representatives by Robert K. Dornan (R., Calif.) in
1982 to label all suspect records: ""WARNING: THIS RECORD CONTAINS
BACKWARD MASKING THAT MAKES A VERBAL STATEMENT WHICH IS AUDIBLE
WHEN THIS RECORD IS PLAYED BACKWARD AND WHICH MAY BE PERCEPTIBLE
AT A SUBLIMINAL LEVEL WHEN THIS RECORD IS PLAYED FORWARD."" In
February 1983, the Arkansas State Senate passed a similar record-
labeling bill by a vote of 86 to 0.
     Contributing to the quasi-occult status of these rumors is
the difficulty of checking them out on home audio equipment. You
pretty much have to take someone else's word for it, or dismiss
the rumors out of hand.
     From a technical standpoint, there are four simple ways to
conceal a verbal message on a recording. The most obvious is to
record the message at a very low volume. The message may then be
recovered by turning the volume up while playing the record or
tape. If the message is faint enough, though, noise levels of home
equipment may garble it. If the accompanying music or lyrics are
loud enough, or if the message itself is indistinct or
electronically modified, it may be hard to hear on any equipment.
     A second gimmick is to record a message on one stereo track
only. Records and tapes have two independent recordings, of
course, normally played simultaneously for stereo effect. On a
record, each stereo track occupies on one side of the V-shaped
groove for the needle. On a tape, the tracks are recorded in
parallel lanes of the magnetic material. The two tracks are called
""right"" and ""left"" after the stereo speakers they will play on.
Otherwise, the tracks are interchangeable -- the sound mixer can
put anything he or she wants on each track. A message on one track
can be masked by simultaneous loud music or lyrics on the opposite
track. With normal stereo balance (or mono equipment) the loud
track drowns out the message track. At home, single-track messages
can be recovered by adjusting the stereo balance so that only the
desired track plays. Sometimes this trick also makes indistinct
words clearer. Even if the words are not exclusively on one track,
they may happen to be more audible on one track.
     A message could be recorded at a speed different from the
rest of the record. Then the record would have to be played faster
or slower than usual to recover the message. Unless the message
was at one of the standard speeds (say, 45 rpm on a 33 1/3 rpm
record), it could not be played normally on home equipment.
     The fourth and most commonly alleged trick is to record a
verbal message backward. Reversed speech has several unexpected
features. One is that syllables are not a constant in the reversal
process. A one-syllable word can have two or three syllables when
played backward. Thus ""number nine"" in the Beatles' REVOLUTION 9
reverses to ""Turn me on, dead man"" (or something like it), a jump
from three to five syllables.
     There is no simple way to predict what a word or phrase will
sound like reversed. Obviously, you can't just reverse the
letters.
     Reversed messages are difficult to recover at home. Record
turntables are not built to go backwards. Some have a neutral
setting, in which the pickup and amplifier remain active and you
can turn the record backward by hand. But hardly anyone has a
stead enough hand to produce satisfactory results.
     With patience, it is possible to reverse a cassette
recording. Transfer the music from the original record or tape
onto a blank tape cassette. Place the cassette flat on a table.
Draw our the part of the tape with the suspected message and snip
it off at both ends. Hold the tape segment horizontally. Rotate it
180 degrees, keep it horizontal at all times. This turns the tape
end for end. Splice the reversed tape segment back onto the two
loose ends of the cassette with strong adhesive tape. Reel the
tape back inside the cassette. The sliced segment will play
backward on an ordinary cassette player.
     I rented a recording studio to test the secret-message
rumors. New copiies of the records in question were transcribed on
a quarter-inch master tape. Where rumor alleged that a single
stereo track contained a message, right and left stereo tracks
were transcribed separately. Records with alleged inaudible
messages were treated similarly. To test claims of reversed
messages, recordings on the master tape were edited out and
spliced in backward. Twenty cuts or portions of cuts from sixteen
albums were tested.


""Another One Bites the Dust""
Queen, THE GAME

Rumor: When played backward, the lyrics say, ""It's fun to smoke
marijuana.""
Findings: There is something that sounds like ""It's fun to smoke
marijuana"" in the reversed music. It is repeated over and over. It
might be rendered no less faithfully, however, as ""sfun to scout
mare wanna."" This ""message"" is the reversal of the song title,
which is repeated as a line in the song.
     Let's make a distinction between engineered and phonetic
reversals. When an artist records a verbal statement, reverses it
by turning the tape end for end, mixes the reversed statement onto
a master tape, and has records and tapes produced from the master,
that is an engineered reversal. When the phonetic properties of
song lyrics are such that they can be reversed to sound like
something else, that is a phonetic reversal.
     ""It's fun to smoke marijuna"" is clearly a phonetic reversal.
The lyrics are perfectly plain played forward (""Another one bites
the dust""), no so plain played backward (""sfun to scout mare
wanna""). With an engineered reversal, the opposite should hold
true: gibberish forward, clear as a bell backward. Some are
prepared to believe that phonetic reversals are just as
intentional as engineered reversals -- that the songwriter
painstakinginly planned the phonetic double-entendre. In the
absence of confirming evidence, that just doesn't wash. It's too
easy to find coincidences. If, for example, the letters of the
alphabet are recited in conventional fashion (Ay, Bee, Cee, etc.)
and reversed, at least five sound like English language words. D
reverses to ""eden,"" F becomes ""pray,"" S becomes ""say,"" V becomes
""even,"" and Z becomes ""easy."" ""It's fun to smoke marijuana"" is
likewise a coincidence.


""A Child is Coming""
Jefferson Starship, BLOWS AGAINST THE EMPIRE

Rumor: When played backward, ""son of Satan.""
Findings: Another phonetic coincidence. The repeated ""It's getting
better"" reverses to an iffy ""son of Satan,"" the ""of"" drawn out and
the ""Satan"" strongly accented on the first syllable.


""Eldorado""
Electric Light Orchestra, ELDORADO

Rumor: When played backward, ""He is the nasty one/ Christ, you're
infernal/ It is said we're dead men/ Everyone who has the mark
will live.""
Findings: Coincidence. The supposed message lurks around the line
""On a voyage of no return to see."" Reversed, this passage becomes
the expected syllable salad -- no one hearing it would describe it
as anything but reversed music. Only if you listen while reading
along with what you're supposed to hear will you get anything. The
rumored version of the message is somewhat fudged. The passage
sounds more like ""He's to nasty one/ Christ you are, Christ,
you're fernal/ There wiss uh, we're dead men..."" There is no ""in""
in what is taken to be ""infernal."" The line that is supposed to be
""Everyone who has the mark will live"" isn't even close, though the
syllable count is right.


""Shoo Be Doo""
The Cars, CANDY-O

Rumor: When played backward, the word ""Satan"" repeated
approximately eleven times.
Findings: Coincidence. The rumor refers to the reversal of the ""Shoo
be doo, shoo be doo, shoo be doo..."" near the end of the song. Given
the mysterious logic of reversed phonemes, these three-syllable units
can be hard as a repeated two-syllable word. The word sounds a little
like ""Satan.""


""Snowblind""
Styx, PARADISE THEATER

Rumor: According to a mimeographed list of suspect records distributed
by Congressman Dornan, the words ""Satan move through our voices"" when
played backwards.
Findings: Negative. Despite repeated listenings, it was not even
possible to identify the part of the reversed track that Dornan et al.
are talking about.


""Stairway to Heaven""
Led Zeppelin, untitled, a.k.a. STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN

Rumor: In reverse, ""I live for Satan... The Lord turns me off...
There's no escaping it... Here's to my sweet Satan... There's power in
Satan... He will give you 666.""
Findings: Coincidence. If you listen very carefully to the ""And it
makes me wonder"" lines in reverse, you'll hear something approaching
""There's no escaping it."" A better description is ""There's no escape
do."" Knock of the last syllable, and you have ""There's no escape,"" a
complete, intelligible sentence in reverse. It's there, all right, but
it's not an unlikely enough coincidence to -- well, make you wonder.
      The ""Satan"" in ""I live for Satan"" is good and clear. The ""I live
for"" part isn't. The other alleged lines are unremarkable. All are
phonetic reversals of the entirely lucid forward lyrics and obviously
just accidents.


""When Electricity Came to Arkansas""
Black Oak Arkansas, BLACK OAK ARKANSAS and RONCH AND ROLL

Rumor: In reverse, ""Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan. He is God. He
is God.""
Findings: The BLACK OAK ARKANSAS cut was reversed. Again, pairs of
reversed syllables are being freely interpreted as ""Satan."" ""He is
God"" was not identifiable.


""Rain""
The Beatles, HEY JUDE

Rumor: Unintelligible lyrics at the end are reversed.
Findings: A true engineered reversal and not really a secret. ""Rain""
seems to have been the first popular recording to incorporate an
obviously reversed lyric. The story is that John Lennon accidentally
spliced the last part of the song in backward and liked the effect.
When reversed, the strange-sounding vocals at the end become
intelligible as a reprise starting with the drawn-out word
""sunshine.""
      The reversal is less apparent to the casual listener than it
might be because the accompanying music is not reversed. The ending
fits in smoothly with the rest of the song, the vocals suggesting a
foreign language.


""Fire on High""
Electric Light Orchestra, FACE THE MUSIC

Rumor: When played backward, ""The music is reversible, but time --
turn back!""
Findings: ""Fire on High"" is instrumental. About twenty-six seconds
into the music, scrambled speech is heard. It is mostly louder than
the accompanying music and begins with a two-syllable unit repeated
several times. The seeming speech lasts for about fourteen seconds.
      Reversing the music confirms that there is a true, engineered
message. In reverse, a voice (Jeff Lynne's?) says, ""The music is
reversible, but time -- turn back! Turn back! Turn back! Turn back!""
All the words are clear and unambiguous. Anyone comparing this to the
alleged reversal on ELO's ""Eldorado"" will have no trouble telling
which is genuine.


""Goodbye Blue Sky""
Pink Floyd, THE WALL

Rumor: In reverse, ""You have discovered the secret message.""
Findings: The ""secret message"" is at the very end of the instrumental
passage following the ""Goodbye Blue Sky"" vocals. It comes just before
the words ""What shall we do"" at the start of the song that is
identified as ""Empty Spaces"" on the record label and as ""What shall we
do now?"" on the record sleeve. Played forward, the message is less
apparent than the FACE THE MUSIC reversal: A reasonably attentive
listener might play THE WALL through and not catch it. It suggests
speech not quite close enough to be overheard. In context this is not
unusual because the ""Goodbye Blue Sky"" instrumental passage includes
""airport noises"" and other sound effects. A loud climax in the music
further masks the unintelligible voice.
      When played backward, the voice (Roger Waters?) plainly intones,
""Congratulations, you have just discovered the secret message. Please
send your answer to old Pink, care of the funny farm..."" As the voice
fades out, there may be another word -- perhaps ""Chalfonte or
""Chelsea"" -- after ""funny farm.""


""Heavy Metal Poisoning""
Styx, KILROY WAS HERE

Rumor: A red sticker on the KILROY WAS HERE cover warns, ""By order of
the Majority for Musical Morality, this album contains secret backward
messages...""
Findings: This is a case of second-generation backward-masking. Styx'
PARADISE THEATER did not contain a backward message, though a lot of
people said it did. So Styx has included a sure enough backward
message on KILROY WAS HERE. It is at the very beginning of ""Heavy
Metal Poisoning."" The reversed speech last about three seconds. There
is no musical background. The words reverse to ""Annuit coeptis. Novus
ordo seclorum."" This is the Latin motto encircling the pyramid on the
back of a dollar bill. The usual translation: ""God has favored our
undertakings. A new order of the ages.""
      The cover sticker's ""Majority for Musical Morality"" is a
fictitious Falwellesque group in the KILROY WAS HERE video. Although
the sticker suggests a plurality of ""messages,"" only one was found.


Space between ""I'm So Tired"" and ""Blackbird""
The Beatles, untitled, a.k.a. THE WHITE ALBUM

Rumor: A reversed message. At the time of the Paul-is-dead stories,
the segue from ""I'm So Tired"" to ""Blackbird"" was offered as evidence.
It was held to contain John Lennon's voice, reveresed, saying ""Paul is
dead, miss him, miss him, miss him."" That interpretation seems
unlikely now, but there is a mysterious low muttering between the
songs.
Findings: The mumbling is actually just to the ""I'm So Tired"" side of
the shiny ""space"" between cuts on the record. Each of the stereo
tracks was recorded separately, twice, and a copy of each track was
reversed. This produced four versions of the two-second passage: right
forward, left forward, right reversed, and left reversed. All were
equally unintelligible. It was not even apparent whether the voice is
forward or reversed. Nor could John Lennon be identified as the
speaker. There are nine or ten syllables. The first six (when played
forward) are a two-syllable unit repeated three times. There is little
or no difference betwen the stereo tracks. Any claimed interpretation
of the sounds seems doubtful.


""Strawberry Fields Forever""
The Beatles, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR

Rumor: It was, of course, claimed that John Lennon says ""I buried
Paul"" at the end. (It's forward, at the very end after the music
fades to complete silence, returns, and starts to fade out again.)
But Lennon told ROLLING STONE that the words are ""cranberry
sauce.""
Findings: They are ""cranberry sauce."" The ""sauce""/""Paul"" part is
indistinct, but the first syllable sounds a lot more like ""cran""
than ""I.""


""Baby You're a Rich Man""
The Beatles, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR

Rumor: On one of the tracks the line ""Baby you're a rich man too""
is sung as ""Baby you're a rich fag Jew,"" a dig at Brian Epstein.
Or some think it's ""rich fat Jew"" and claim it as evidence of
Beatle anti-Semitism.
Findings: Negative. The two stereo tracks are nearly identical.
It's always possible to hear words as similar-sounding words, but
basically, the lyrics jibe with the published version.


""Revolution 9""
The Beatles, untitled, a.k.a. THE WHITE ALBUM

Rumor: Various reversed and/or one-track speech. The reversal of
""Number nine"" to ""Turn me on, dead man"" has pretty much been
discounted as coincidence (though it appears on Congressman
Dornan's list).
Findings: Distinction between lyrics and any hidden message blurs
on ""Revolution 9."" The eight-minute cut is a montage of sounds
collected by John Lennon and Yoko Ono. It includes discordant
music, radio broadcasts, sirens, applause, gunfights, sports
cheers, the crackling of a fire, screams, a baby gurgling, a choir
singing, and much that cannot be identified. For this
investigation, ""Revolution 9"" was transcribed four times, twice on
each stereo channel. One copy of each of the tracks was reversed.
The four resulting versions were compared with each other and
against the original two-channel version.
     ""Revolution 9"" contains a lot of talking. Played in stereo,
forward, the longest stretch of understandable speech is probably
an announcer saying, ""...every one of them knew that as time went
by they'd get a little bit older and a little bit slower...""
     One believable instance of reversed speech occurs: someone
saying ""Let me out! Let me out!"" (once held to represent McCartney
in his totaled Aston-Martin). Two iffy reversals occur on the
backward recording of the right stereo track:""She used to be
assistant"" and ""There were two men..."" Neither is clear enough or
long enough to be convincing. Some of the music, including the
recurring theme, sounds more natural in reverse.
     ""Turn me on, dead man"" is a typical phonetic reversal. The
forward ""number nine"" (repeated throughout the cut) is clear; the
reversal is slurred -- something like ""turn me on dedmun."" It has
been claimed that ""number nine"" must be pronounced with a British
accent or with some careful inflection in order to reverse to
""Turn me on, dead man."" This seems not to be so. As an experiment,
three American-accent renderings of ""number nine"" were reversed.
All sound about as much like ""Turn me on, dead man"" as the record
did. Like the other phonetic reversals, ""Turn me on, dead man""
must be considered a coincidence.
     Much of ""Revolution 9"" is on one stereo track only. Near the
end a voice says ""A fine natural imbalance...the Watusi...the
twist...Eldorado...Eldorado."" ""A fine natural imbalance"" is on the
right track only, though the words that follow are in stereo. One
of the longer bits of speech -- ""Who could tell what he was
saying? His voice was low and his [unintelligible] was high and
his eyes were low"" -- is clear on the left track, a bare whisper
on the right.
     There is a stereophonically concealed ""secret message"" on
""Revolution 9."" The words are on the right track. They begin about
four minutes, fifty-eight seconds into the cut and run for about
twenty-two seconds. They are not likely to be noticed in stereo
because of the much louder left track. The sound of applause
begins on the left track at about five minutes, one second into
the cut. Deafening noises -- the clapping, sirens, music --
continue on the left track until five minutes, forty seconds. It
may or may not have been Lennon's and Ono's intention to conceal
the spoken passage. Given the haphazard quality of ""Revolution 9,""
the concealment may have been accidental. To recover the passage,
the left track must be switched off. The right track can then be
heard to contain a sound like a stopwatch ticking, behind these
words:

     So the wife called, and we better go to see a
     surgeon....[A SCREAM MUFFLES A LINE THAT SOUNDS LIKE
     Well, what with the prices, the prices have snowballed,
     no wonder it's closed.] ...So any and all, we went to
     see the dentist instead, who gave him a pair of teeth,
     which wasn't any good at all. So instead of that he
     joined the bloody navy and went to sea.
                      by William Poundstone
                              1986

     There really are backward messages on rock albums. And the
controversy over ""backward masking"" and ""porn rock"" has inspired a
whole new spate of messages. There may have been more genuine
backward messages in the past few years than ever before.
     The backward message controversy is usually traced to the
1960s and John Lennon's avant-garde sound mixing on such tracks as
""Revolution 9"" on the Beatles' WHITE ALBUM. Lennon probably wasn't
trying to conceal a message so much as create an interesting
sound.
     The matter might have ended right there had it not been for
the Paul McCartney death rumor. College kids tried playing Beatles
records forward, backward, and at various speeds to find ""clues""
to McCartney's fate. In the process they found snippets of speech
from Lennon's experiments. Even after McCartney was found safe and
sound in Scotland, some listeners continued to look for hidden
messages.
     Somehow, fundamentalist Christian groups became convinced
(ca. 1982) that the alleged messages were commercials for devil
worship. Not a single indisputable satanic message has turned up,
but there were scattered attempts to ban or label certain albums.
In 1986 one fundamentalist group announced that the theme song for
the old MR. ED TV show contains the word ""Satan"" when played
backward.)
     Ironically, the publicity accorded nonexistent messages has
inspired several artists -- among them porn rock hearing witness
Frank Zappa -- to hide real background messages in their music.
It's easy to do.
     The performer speaks or sings the message normally, then
reverses the tape, which is mixed into the soundtrack. This is all
accomplished simply enough at any recording studio.
     What's not so simple is playing it back. More home record,
cassette, and compact disk players won't play backward. You can
turn a record backward with a pencil eraser, but it's not good for
the needle or the turntable. The only way to reproduce the message
with full fidelity is to use a professional-quality reel-to-reel
tape player and splice the tape in backward.
     We used the facilities of KLOS radio in Los Angeles to
reverse some recent records containing true backward messages.


""Secret Messages""
Electric Light Orchestra, SECRET MESSAGES

ELO's ELDORADO album was among those alleged to contain satanic
backward masked messages. A patient listening to ELDORADO played
backward reveals no such messages. You hear only what you ought to
hear -- the reversed lyrics of the songs, which sound nothing like
the ""messages"" claimed to be there. In the wake of such
allegations, ELO did put an (innocuous) backward message on their
FACE THE MUSIC album. Perhaps they thought this would show how
silly the allegations were. Instead, the backward-masking people
seized on this as proof that the other ""messages"" were real. In
the latest volley, ELO has named an album after the controversy.
     In Britain (where the backward-masking issue is viewed as an
American eccentricity), the cover of SECRET MESSAGES has a mock
warning label to youth about the hidden label. Word of the albums'
impending release in the United States caused enough of a furor to
chill CBS Records into deleting the cover blurb.
     The reversed message is easy to find. It's at the beginning
of the first song, which is itself called ""Secret Messages."" You
can hear reversed speech when you play the record normally. A
voice intones ""secret messages"" -- forward -- in the middle of the
reversed speech, lest anyone dare be so unhip as to not know
what's going on.
     We transferred a new copy of SECRET MESSAGES to reel-to-reel
tapes and played it backward. The backward message goes: ""WELCOME
TO THE BIG SHOW/ WELCOME TO THE BIG SHOW.""
     That's it.


""Ya Hozna""
Frank Zappa, THEM OR US

""Ya Hozna,"" a six-minute composition on the first record of the
THEM OR US double album, is ENTIRELY backward. The albums' inner
cover, which includes lyrics for the other songs, says, ""backwards
vocal -- you figure it out"" of this cut. It credits Frank and Moon
Zappa, George Duke, and Napoleon Murphy Brock as vocalists.
     Played forward, ""Ya Howza"" sounds like a record played
backward -- reasonably so. The vocals are prominent and
unintelligible. Moon Zappa's voice is curiously recognizable, even
in reverse. It is hard to tell whether the music was recorded
forward or backward.
     When ""Ya Howza"" is played in reverse, you discover that the
music is virtually a palindrome -- it sounds about the same
forward and backward. The voices are all backward. In some cases
they have been modified electronically. Many of the words are
muffled. Even after repeated careful listening on both stereo
tracks, it is difficult to make out many of the lyrics. It doesn't
help that some of the words seem to be stream-of-consciousness
nonsense. Some of the unintelligible stuff sounds like opera.
     Starting at the beginning of the reversed tape -- the end of
the forward tape -- the clearer vocals go like this: ""I am the
heaven, I am the water."" This is in a hymnlike register. ""You are
a lonely little girl./ But your mommy and your daddy hold you."" A
singsong synthesizer voice.
     The most interesting part of the lyrics is an intermittently
orgasmic rap in Moon Zappa's Valley Girl voice. There are three
short monologues:

I'm like green!
I'm like squat!
I'm like soul!
Repeat, like soul!
I'm like pull, push,
Okay, like slow, slow.

You're never too old
Like slow, like slow, like slow
Okay, I like it.


All right, faster, faster,
Go, do it, do it twice,
Yeah, that feels good,
I'm looking great,
Yeah, fer shure!
Like, no way!


""No Anchovies, Please""
J. Geils Band, LOVE STINKS

""No Anchovies, Please"" is a novelty song, really a narration with
sound effects, about a woman who is kidnapped after eating
anchovies. She is taken to a ""foreign-speaking"" country. The sound
effect of the foreign tongue seems reversed. When you do play it
in reverse, it becomes: ""It doesn't take a genius to know the
difference between chicken shit and chicken salad.""


""Darling Nikki""
Prince, PURPLE RAIN

""Darling Nikki,"" cited as porn rock before Congress, is about a
dominatrix in a hotel lobby masturbating with a magazine. In part,
the complaint was that the album cover (flowers, and Prince on a
motorcycle) wasn't explicit enough to warn kids of the suggestive
lyrics. Senator Paula Hawkins apparently was not aware of a
backward message hidden in ""Darling Nikki."" The last thirty-five
seconds of the song is gibberish. The music changes abruptly and
becomes a repeated glottal sound. Then a two-syllable sound is
repeated twice, something like ""heaven, heaven."" Unintelligible
speech follows. At the end is a sound reminiscent of rain or bacon
frying , and wind sounds.
     Played backward, the message becomes:

     Hello, how are you?
     I'm fine 'cause I know that the Lord is coming soon.
     Coming, coming soon.

     It is clearly Prince and the Revolution singing this. The
words are clear but the intonation is funny -- the linger on some
words. Perhaps this is to make the reversed message you hear
playing the record normally a little less conspicuous.
     This is a weird reversal of the supposed secret message
menace. Raunchy forward lyrics conceal a religious secret message.


""Judas Kiss""
Petra, MORE POWER TO YOU

Petra is an obscure group that sings religious songs to a rock
beat. As further proof that things have gone full circle, the
backward-masking controversy prompted Petra to include a wholesome
backward message on their MORE POWER TO YOU album. It is in the
transition between two songs, just before ""Judas Kiss."" Clearly
audible gibberish reverses to this (the husky voice a cross
between George Beverly Shea and Dee Snider): ""What are you looking
for the Devil for, when you ought to be looking for the Lord?""

AFL JoyceM Welcome to the Apple II Music & Sound chat - our discussion will
           be on NoiseTracker - the new FTA music program for the GS.  AFA
           Gene will be our host this evening...Gene, the floor is yours :)

AFA Gene   Hi all... well first I'd like to point out, if y'all aren't aware
           yet, that a spanking new version of NoiseTracker has recently
           been released (9 days ago) and is now available in our New Files
           library. It is version 0.5. I haven't played around with it much
           yet, but it's supposed to fix a lot of the little bugs in 0.3
           (the first version we had online).  NoiseTracker also includes
           the ability to directly import ""modules,"" a term used for a
           certain type of Amiga song file which has become popular among PC
           users using the SoundBlaster sound card.

           Now, via NT, these ""MOD"" files are accessible by the GS. We
           expect to see a lot of activity on this end as far as ports from
           the PC and Amiga go. Note that you should be able to go straight
           to the PC music forum and download any recently uploaded MOD
           songfiles (there was a bug in the first wide release of the PCAO
           software, however, so a bunch of files with dates between around
           March 1991 and September 1991 may not download properly. Note that
           to use these PC MOD files, you'll have to rename the downloaded
           file ""MOD.xxxxxx"" if you want it to show up automatically in NT's
           ""open"" dialog box. (On the PC, all MOD files are named
           ""xxxxxxxx.MOD"" instead.)   Also, if the files are packed with ZIP
           compression, you'll need a program from the Communications Forum
           called AGATE -- it's a terminal program that includes the ability
           to unpack ZIP files.

           Now, I guess the best thing to do would be to talk about our
           favorite songfiles... there have been a few complaints, in fact,
           that people were not being ""descriptive"" enough in their file
           descriptions for uploads in describing the songs.

AFC Eddie  ?

AFA Gene   GA ed

AFC Eddie  Once a MOD file is unpacked with Agate, is a file type change
           needed?

AFA Gene   Nope, since all that NT looks for is the ""MOD."" being the first
           four characters in the filename.

AFC Eddie  OK, Thanks!

Deanna7332 Question...

JonL7      Can you list some of the features of Noisetracker?

AFA Gene   (you don't even need that ""MOD."" if you want to type the name in
           directly.)

Deanna7332 Did any of these mod files have anything to do with FTA's ""Module
           A""

AFA Gene   Sure Jon, right after we answer Deanna's question. Deanna, you
           mean ""Modulae?""

Deanna7332 Yes, that's it.

AFA Gene   Modulae was a demo written by FTA last year. (i'll get to you in a
           sec Doors).  It used SoundSmith v0.95 for all it's music. There
           is no connection between MOD files and Modulae by FTA.

Deanna7332 Throughout the demo it said ""Loading modules""

AFA Gene   Those ""modules"" are not the same as Amiga soundfile ""modules"" --
           you see, what Modulae really was was a ""stringing together"" of a
           bunch of neat little tiny demos that FTA had written. So they
           called each little demo a ""module"" and thus the entire demo as a
           whole, ""Modulae"" (fancy plural of module?)

Deanna7332 Ok I understand.  Thank you. :)

AFL JoyceM Latin, Gene :)

AFA Gene   The term ""MODule"" from the Amiga comes from the idea that all the
           stuff needed to play the songfile (all the instruments + the
           sequence file) are included into one file, the ""module.""

TheDoors1  Gene, I have tried to d/l some recent uploaded MODs in the PC
           music area and still the problem exists.

AFA Gene   As I understand it, the problem was fixed VERY recently (correct
           me on this Joyce) and files uploaded as recently as early
           November still might not work depending on the version of the
           PCAO software that the uploader used.

AFL JoyceM Actually, Gene...I was under the impression that it had been, but
           if Doors is still having a problem, then it must not be fixed.

AFA Gene   What date was the file you tried to d/l, Door?

TheDoors1  umm 11/17, around there

AFA Gene   hmmm.... well i can tell you one thing... if it didn't work, don't
           waste your time again later... the problem is in the Apple
           software's method of d/lling files, and there are no plans to
           upgrade the Apple AO software.

AFL JoyceM I will endeavor to get an answer to that PC downloading
           problem/question :)

ThomasK63  i have a quick question... what can you use to unpack amiga mod
           files? On the PC side, that is.

TheDoors1  Agate Thomas

ELECTMUSIC Doors... what happens on after downloading..

Deanna7332 If it's LZHed you can't unless you have an IBM or
           PC/Transporter.

AFA Gene   If GS-ShrinkIt doesn't have that ability, i don't think there
           exists any such utility on the GS.

TheDoors1  What do you mean Elect?

ELECTMUSIC After you download the file... where do you encounter a problem?

TheDoors1  ok, you know when you download the file and at some point in the
           download the file starts to appear on your screen.  That's when I
           cancel it.

ThomasK63  I am sure soething good can be made w/out resorting to Amiga
           files

AFC Eddie  Yes, Doors, I believe the problem is with the PC software it was
           UL'd with.

TheDoors1  yeah Eddie.

GNO Tim    Amiga MOD files are typically compressed using LHarc.  I've
           uncompressed several on my Unix machine at school.

ThomasK63  good time for someone to make a lharc unpacker...

AFC DYAJim someone might be ;)

GNO Tim    Several people are already

AFC Eddie  Can't wait, Jim!

AFA Gene   Jon, did you have a question?

JonL7      The features of Noisetracker :)

AFA Gene   Oh yes... okay, here goes, in a nutshell, from most important to
           least:


AFA Gene   *  ability to import MOD files

           *  ability to import Soundsmith files

           *  ProDOS 8 based

           *  virtually no editing abilities (not a feature but important to
           know)

AFC DYAJim :)

AFA Gene   *  forgot: and the most important feature of all, the ability to
           hold instrument files in regular system RAM instead of DOC RAM,
           allowing for instruments far beyond the regular 64K limit found
           in ALL other GS music programs.

ThomasK63  I'll buy that!

TheDoors1  I have another question...when you're ready.

AFA Gene   GA Doors

TheDoors1  ok..is it true that NoiseTracker will take in soundsmith files and
           play them more clearly

AFA Gene   Well, as far as ""what you hear,"" yes there is a definite
           difference with some instruments. It does NOT play the sounds
           more ""clearly,"" but it just plays them in a different way. What
           many people seem to like about this ""different way"" is that
           sustained instruments (i.e. instruments designed to be played
           in a loop to simulate a long held note) seem to work better (or
           perhaps simply the way they were originally intended to work).

TheDoors1  I see

Deanna7332 Which takes up more space - MOD or NT  w/soundfile ?

AFA Gene   Deanna, it depends a few things, such as how big the sequence is,
           how many instruments you have, etc. Once you have a lot of
           assorted files, it'll probably average out to be about the same
           give or take a hundred blocks on your HD. So it basically depends
           on whether you prefer to have your instruments separate or not.

Deanna7332 Does playing quality differ with either one ?

AFA Gene   Nope. It's exactly the same either way. Loading time is the same
           too.

AFC Eddie  Can NT save songs as MOD files?

AFA Gene   Nope. It has options for Open and Close module, but these are
           still inactive.

AFA Gene   If there are no more questions, I'd like to talk about which NT
           files out there are the ""hottest,"" since this info could be
           useful to many users who are interested in downloading NT/MOD
           files.

           My personal favorite is ""Lambada,"" which is supplied by FTA with
           the program but is available separately on America
           Online.Everything about this file is really impressive except
           perhaps the sound quality of the horn-ish melody instrument.

           What about y'all, what are your favorite NT files?

AFL JoyceM Gene, there is a classical song for NT, but can't remember the
           name, but it is good.

AFC Eddie  I like Dragnet!

ELECTMUSIC So do I Ed

TheDoors1  I like Seven something

Deanna7332 My most favorite of all mod files is Pleasure Principle

AFC Eddie  <--appreciate's Greg's taste!

AFL JoyceM :)

AFA Gene   Deanna, i assume you got that from a local board?

Deanna7332 I got it from the PC forum here.

TheDoors1  I saw it there also

Deanna7332 I think under ""Pleasure""

AFA Gene   Would you be able to upload it here? If it's really that good, we
           ought to have it available directly in our oun NT lib here (BTW
           folks, we will be releasing a new NoiseTracker software library
           soon!)

AFC Eddie  What a Forum!!!

Deanna7332 That sounds great!

AFL JoyceM Gene, do you think it will be possible for synthLAB files to be
           converted to MOD files?

AFL JoyceM MOD files?

AFA Gene   I doubt it, Joyce. The formats are so diametrically opposed in
           their entire basis of their file formats that it wouldn't be
           worth the time for a programmer to develop such a convertor.

Deanna7332 Isn't it possible to move the mod file from the PC forum to our
           music library?

AFA Gene   But..... it might be worth the time for a MIDI File Format to MOD
           convertor, since these two formats are more widely accepted.

Nuzz       they have nothing better to do Gene

ELECTMUSIC Gene.. some interesting similarities with DTune and NTracker

AFA Gene   They lose the file, tho, Deanna. :)

AFL JoyceM In what way, Greg?

ELECTMUSIC Both Prodos 8

Deanna7332 Shhh they won't know a thing :)

ELECTMUSIC I also believe Bill uses a shuttling of sound data between Doc
           Ram and Ram.

AFC Eddie  Interesting, Greg.

ELECTMUSIC Thats how he gets some of the excellent instrument quality

AFC Eddie  But Diversitune has that one distinction:  MIDI input.

AFL JoyceM Deanna, we would greatly appreciate it if you would upload that
           'Pleasure' song to our library :)

ELECTMUSIC Agreed Ed.. one of the factors FTA doesn't like to incorporate
           into their programs.

Deanna7332 I'll u/l it tonight if possible.

AFL JoyceM Thanks :)

AFC Eddie  Thanks, Deanna!

AFL JoyceM I will send Bill B a copy of NoiseTracker + some MOD files...to
           see what comments we get from him (will send when I get back).

AFC DYAJim What ever happened to that diversitune upgrade that was talked
           about ?

ELECTMUSIC That would be interesting Joyce

AFC Eddie  Bill apparently still working on it, Jim.

ELECTMUSIC I am sure he would appreciate the Prodos 8

AFC DYAJim good..

AFL JoyceM Jim...RSN....he was hoping by Christmas (this year), but he is
           soooo busy with his job, who knows?

AFC DYAJim Oh yeah, I noticed the speed calcuation in NT .5 is inaccurate
           :)

AFC DYAJim I recall he has set a lot of Christmas projected dates :)

ELECTMUSIC He was one of the first ""Free Tools"" experts in breaking all the
           rules for economic sake.

AFC DYAJim like for the vaporware DT inst editor like 2 years ago.

Deanna7332 Are there any Christmas Mod or NT songs?

AFC Eddie  Oh yeah, Diversi-Editor!

AFL JoyceM I know, Jim - but that I know he has been working on.

AFC DYAJim he projected Christmas for it, and it never came :)

AFA Gene   Not yet in AMS, but hopefully the Holiday Contest will change all
           that. :)

AFC DYAJim I look foreward to any upgrades..

AFL JoyceM Not that I am aware of Deanna - you have some?  hint, hint

Deanna7332 Nope sorry.  I was hoping there were some that could be u/led
           here

AFC DYAJim I'll be breaking out the xmas tune book rsn.. I should be able to
           midi a few :) (which rules out nt)

AFL JoyceM Question...

AFC Eddie  It would be more appropriate to have a converter from Appleworks
           spreadsheet to MOD than from MIDI!

AFL JoyceM If I got ahold of an Amiga song (MOD) disk...how would I convert
           them for here?

AFA Gene   You mean an Amiga-formatted disk?

AFL JoyceM Yes

AFC DYAJim Ack.. methinks you need an amiga and a null modem cable or a
           modem.

AFA Gene   Methinks Jim is right

AFC DYAJim LOL!!  Design your music in the spreadsheet then import to NT :)
           IT might actually have better editing?!! :)

AFC Eddie  Right!

AFL JoyceM Me thinks he is right.  If I had them upload to me, would that
           work?

AFA Gene   Yep; should work like a charm.

AFC DYAJim Yah.. as long as they're coming from an amiga

AFL JoyceM Great....I will work on that when I get back  (making note now).

AFL JoyceM Gene, will you get some of those files (NT) sent to that area
           tonight?  If so, I will leave the needed message :)

AFA Gene   That's all I have planned for tonight's chat, Joyce. Yep, I'll
           move some files right now.

AFL JoyceM Thanks...

AFL JoyceM Then we should have our NoiseTracker Library by end of the week in
           AMS :)

ELECTMUSIC Gene... quick question:  Are you launching NTracker from a 3.5
           disk?

AFL JoyceM Okay, guys...I will see you all the week of December 11th (may the
           4th) as I am off on vacation.

AFA Gene   Yep greg

AFC JohnC  Where are you going?

ELECTMUSIC Do you encounter out of memory problems

AFL JoyceM Night all...and Gene, thanks for an excellent chat and great
           explanations of NoiseTracker.

Nuzz       Joyce, I have good news for FutureSound owners. SoundConvert will
           support it in the first release

AFC Eddie  Great, Mike!

AFA Gene   Greg, i always keep my RAMdisk at 0 when using noisetracker. Not
           only are

AFC JohnC  Mike...SoundConvert...released?

AFL JoyceM Great, Mike.  When can we get SoundConvert, Mike? and FutureSound
           :)

AFA Gene   there a couple of bugs with memory management, but if you're
           loading in a MOD file that's really big, NT will eat your RAMdisk.

AFC Eddie  Sounds good.

Nuzz       The manual is being ""layout"". Release date should be about 1st
           week of Dec

ELECTMUSIC Tnxs Gene

AFC JohnC  YES.......WTG Nuzz!!!!!!!!

Deanna7332 Yes, why is there on some MOD files a stop somewhere in the middle
           ?

Deanna7332 That's really frustrating!

AFL JoyceM Mike, leave me E-Mail on when and how I can send your the $$ to
           get it.

AFL JoyceM Again...night all

Nuzz       gee John, I had to do something to explain the delay :)

ELECTMUSIC Thanks Gene for a GREAT chat!

AFC Eddie  Yes, Gene!  Great!

AFA Gene   Thanks Greg, 'night!

AFA Gene   thanx, see y'all later :)

Down to earth, easy-to-understand method to making your own designs.
Excellent, excellent book.  She writes with a sense of humour and
shows loads of examples to get you thinking.  It's an excellent back

PATTERN ON PATTERN

This is an excellent book.


PRECISION PIECED QUILTS USING THE FOUNDATION METHOD

written and very nicely illustrated with b&w photos, color plates and
instructional line drawings.


PIECES OF THE PAST
by Nancy Martin
That Patchwork Place


PLAIN AND SIMPLE
by Sue Bender

book that I started learning how to quilt.


PATCHWORK QUILTS TO MAKE FOR CHILDREN
by Margaret Rolfe
Sterling Publishing Co. Inc. New York

I can attest to both of these books as great sources for easily
pieced animal blocks.  The GO WILD book was a great hit when we
had it for the book draw at our guild meeting.  It contains 14
North American Animals (racoon, beaver, ducks etc).
----
My favorite for children.  This book hasas a whole zoo, patterns for many
dinosaurs, farm animals, etc.   In my opinion they are more fun than
traditional blocks and make finding naturalistic fabrics fun too.

QuiltNet last fall and noone could find the pattern for.  It has a number of
other interesting patterns in it for large print fabrics.


QUILT ALMANAC 19xx
by Oxmoor House

These are some of my favorites too. The quilts range from very simple
to very difficult. The patterns are good and I enjoy the biographies.
There's a chapter each year on group quilts or guild quilts and someday
I expect I'll see a QuiltNet quilt featured there!


QUILT STORIES
by Cecilia Macheski, editor
Lexington: The University of Kentucky Press, 1994.

This wonderful book is a collection of poems, short stories, and other prose
works by various authors over the past 150-200 years, all dealing somehow with
quilts and quilting.  The book is divided into 5 sections (""blocks""), each
named for specific quilt blocks: Memory Blocks (""Stories of Remembrance and
Meaning""), Double Wedding Ring (""Stories of Community and Courtship""), Radical
Rose (""Stories of Struggle and Change""), Wheel of Mystery (""Stories of Murder
and Mystery""), and Old Maid's Ramble (""Stories of Age and Wisdom"").  The

how quilting provided an important link in literature written by women
(although there are a couple of selections from male authors).

I would like to list a book that several people in my guild highly recommend as
a ""every quilter must have"" book.

I made the ""Alley Cats"" as a going away present a few years ago and the
recipient loved it.

There is a neat pieced maple leaf pattern in this book. It shows four standard
pieced maple leaves set in a block so that each maple leaf is pointing towards
a different corner.


QUILT PROJECTS BY MACHINE
by Singer, 1992

There is a small section on Bow Ties (about a half doz or so pages) in this
book.  It shows several arrangements: traditional, zigzag, octagonal,
staggered.
There are a couple of neat arrangements using color (oh, no, I'm starting
to write ""American""!) gradations, as well as scrap, necktie fabrics and
amish colours.  It gives a couple of ideas for borders and sashings as well.


QUILT A KOALA
by Margaret Rolfe.
Sterling Publishing

Another fun book.  This one has patterns for pieced blocks featuring native
Austrailian birds and animals.


QUILTER'S PATTERN WORKBOOK ($12.95)

This book has templates for the bow tie block and demonstrates how the block

QUILTS! QUILTS!! QUILTS!!! ($21.95)
The Complete Guide to Quiltmaking
by Diana McClun and Laura Nownes
The Quilt Digest Press, 1988

Great book.

Includes patterns that beginning quiltmakers can complete successfully, as well
as designs an experienced quiltmaker will enjoy working with.  Popular and
traditional patterns--and all the instructions for the techniques required to
make them.

The patterns are arranged in a progressive sequence, incorporating new designs
and utilizing more difficult techniques as you move from the simpler patterns
to the more complex.  Some patterns require more precise work than others, but
with careful work all can be completed by the quiltmaker who begins with the
simpler patterns, moving onward as experience warrants.


QUILTS, QUILTS, AND MORE QUILTS
by McClun and Nownes.

This book is just as good as their first book (see above).


QUILTER'S ALBUM OF BLOCKS AND BORDERS

Great black and white illustrations of blocks to give you ideas for blocks and
the shading of the blocks. (re: black and white quilts).


ROMANCE OF THE PATCHWORK QUILT IN AMERICA, THE
by Hall and Kretsinger

(answer to question on pattern for Seven Sisters)  Thi book has a picture of a

pattern.

Good book for making stars.


ROTARY ROUNDUP
Judy Hopkins & Nancy Martin
That Patchwork Place

Both books (Rotary Riot below) have about 40 color prints of quilts.  These
quilts are made from traditional block patterns and have instructions for
rotary cutting and quick piecing.  Nancy Martin owns the publishing company
that published these two books.
----
I had Rotary Riot, so I had to buy this one too and I'm not one bit sorry.  I
love to get ideas and inspiration from these books and this one is full of
great colors,beautiful quilts.  Their books are the only ones I use when I need
to make bias binding as it shows the flat cut method.  The only times I tried
to do the continuous circle, it ends up in a mess.


ROTARY RIOT: 40 Fast & Fabulous Quilts ($21.95)
by Judy Hopkins and Nancy J. Martin
That Patchwork Place 1991

The authors of this book take 40 traditional blocks that appeal to many
quiltmakers and adapted their construction to template-free techniques.  Begins
with Nancy's basic review of rotary-cutting techniques and information on
multi-fabric quilts.  The pattern section includes step-by-step directions for
forty favorite quilts, all clearly illustrated and written in a Template-Free
format.  Some of the patterns feature bias squares, some cut with 8"" Bias
Square and several use simple strip-piecing techniques.  The patterns are
graded with symbols as to difficulty (beginner, intermediate, advanced).  Judy
has written a section on Finishing Your Quilt and has included some of the
overall repeat quilting patterns for which she is known.  Also included is
information on crow footing, utility quilting and other tacking techniques.


REMEMBER ME; Women and their Friendship Quilts
Lipsett, Linda Otto.
San Francisco, Quilt Digest Press, 1985.
Pb, 140 p, col & b/w ill.

One of the very best quilt books ever Linda Otto Lipsett began with her own
collection of 19th century  friendship quilts. Her book tells the stories of
eight women and eight  quilts made between 1840 and 1895. Many of the stories
are sad stories  of leaving family and comfortable homes in the East to
undertake arduous  journeys in pursuit of new homes in the West. Using letters,
diaries,  interviews and the quilts themselves the author unfolds the everyday
lives of eight real women, following them from youth to old age. Photos  show
the women, their families, their homes, and especially their quilts.  The
excellent color photographs show full quilts, details of blocks,  signatures
and ornaments, and the best close-ups of 19th century fabrics  I have seen.
There are also pictures of other typical friendship quilts,  patterns for three
quilts prepared by Laura Nownes, and complete  references and bibliography.


SMALL AMISH QUILT PATTERNS
by Rachel Pellman
Good Books, Intercourse, PA 1985

Patterns for making small amish quilts.


STRIP QUILTING ($14.95)
by Diane Wold
TAB Books, Div. of McGraw Hill 1987

I love this little book.  It's perfect for those who are into piecing and
repiecing (seminole patchwork take off).  It's very easy to follow.

It contains complete instructions, including diagrams, cutting instructions,
and a shopping list, for each of the projects illustrated.  Pointers are given
for modifying projects, for adapting patterns from other sources and for
creating your own designs.


SIGNS AND SYMBOLS:  African Images in African-American Quilts ($24.00)
by Maude Southwell Wahlman
Studio Books in association with Museum of American Folk Art, New York

This book introduces the art of African-American quiltmaking to the general
public.  Her thesis is that most African-American quiltmaking derives its
aesthetic from various African traditionsk, both technological and ideological.


Provides an abundance of detailed information on African textiles, the history
of quiltmaking in India, Europe and the Americas and extensive interviews with
quilters.

Excellent.


SCRAP QUILTS
by Judy Martin
Moon Over the Mountain Publishing, Wheatridge, Colo  1985

Techniques plus patterns old and new for making quiltsa from collected fabrics.
Very nice, colorful quilts.  I bought this book because I saw her quilt
""Tennessee Waltz"" on display at the Great American Quilt Festival 1993 in New
York (quilt on page 60).


SHORTCUTS:  A Concise Guide to Rotary Cutting
by Donna Thomas
That Patchwork Place, Bothell, WA  1991

Basic quick-cutting techniques plus a number of techniques that are expansions
of the basics.


SASHIKO FOR MACHINE SEWING
by Janet K. Rostocki
Summa Design

These designs are cleverly constructed so that they can be continuously
sewn on the machine.  Five classic designs are included and 8 new designs.
They could all be handsewn if you wanted to do that.  Each is given in
two sizes.


SENSATIONAL SETTINGS
(Over 80 ways to arrange your quilt blocks) ($9.95)
by Joan Hanson
That Patchwork Place  1993

Good book offering a lot of ideas/suggestions for arranging quilt blocks.


SPEED CUTS
by Donna Poster
Chilton for the Creative Machine Arts Series.

In it there are 1200 quilt blocks (although I would say that there
are only 500 designs but each can be constructed in one of three
sizes 10"" 12"" and 14""). Also, there is a quilt layout section that
shows how many blocks you will need for each size quilt depending on
whether you are putting the blocks together on point, straight set,
with lattice or any combination of these.

Of course, also included is a yardage chart based on the templates to
be used. And the templates themselves are in the back, numbered.

Note:  Blocks are all in black and white.


STRIPS THAT SIZZLE
by Margaret Miller

My first B&W quilt was made using this book. It is a book primarily meant for
working in color, but I thought the technique worked extraordinarily well for
black and white.  I believe that almost any quilt pattern could be used if you
watch your placement as to shading.


SMALL TALK
by Donna Thomas
That Patchwork Place.

I am very impressed with the progressive directions (from easiest to more
difficult) they are easy to follow and the pictures were inspiring.  I would
highly recommend it.


SETS & BORDERS
by Marston & Cunningham, AQS

I have had this book a long time.  It has lots of good photos, border ideas and
charts for planning them.  I have found it inspirational and helpful.
----
Wonderful color photos of quilts with comments about their settings/borders.
Also, a good look at how different borders can change a quilt.  Finally,
patterns and ideas for a variety of borders. Really stimulatd my thinking and
I'm looking forward to trying some of the ideas.
----
This'un shows lots'n'lots of possible ways to set blocks, and also a goodly
number of border possibilities.  There are several cases where the book shows
essentially the same blocks in more than one quilt, but the borders and/or
setting vary.  It's one I use as an imagination trigger when I need to decide
on a border.


SENSATIONAL SCRAP QUILTS
by Darra Duffy Williamson

I like this book, particularly the section on selecting fabrics for scrap
quilts.  I used her idea of making a reference card of all the colors in the
quilt (you take a small piece of each and organize them on a card in a
continuous line from light to dark, ignoring color) and it worked a treat on a
planned scrap quilt I made using about 40 pinks and greys.

QNM did a review and hated it, they said there was nothing new in it. I think
it is well laid out and gives you lots to think about.
----
I learned a lot from this book. First, I discovered D.D. Williamsons theory of
the ""Maverick"" block in quilts using repeating blocks!  That has helped me to
add more fun and excitement to my quilts.  It also has a section on color use
and drafting patterns.  I find I go back and read this book over and over.
Wonderful!


STAR QUILTS ($20)
by Mary Elizabeth Johnson
Clarkson Potter Publishers

Good collection of star quilts.
----
I like this book. She is well organized and gives you some good photos and
directions. Haven't tried anything from it yet. (I got it from a closeout
catalog for under $10. It's a good deal at that price. Not sure if I'd pay
$20 for it though.)


TEXTILE DESIGNS ($65.00)
Susan Meller and Joost Elffers
AQS, Paducah, KY

This book is expensive but worth it if you are a fabric collector.  This book
has some introductory discussion of the the production of types of textiles,
and then the rest is color plates of examples from a collection that has over
5,000,000 ""fabrics of the common man"" - not the fancy brocades, etc., but
paisleys, calicoes, leaves and foliage, conversationals, block prints, and on,
and on - the kind of stuff that many of us in our quilts.
------
Most of its 461 pages are filled with excellent color pictures  (1,823
illustrations in color) of fabrics we'd all like to have. Color reproduction is
good and the pictures are large so that you can see the pattern detail. My only
serious criticism of the book is that reproductions are not all full-size or
even to the same scale. Page layout seems to have dictated the scale of
reproduction, and on the same page there are illustrations at 50%, 68% and 70%
full size, on other pages 27%, 100%, 120% and 150%. I suppose we should
appreciate the indication of scale included for each sample.

Although the book is expensive, it is not overpriced for a large format
art book with full-color illustrations on good quality paper. It has a
sewn binding and is very sturdily put together.


THREE-DIMENSIONAL APPLIQUE & EMBROIDERY ($24.95)
by Anita Shackelford

A beautiful book!!
For those of you interested in these two subjects this is a
wonderful book.  Good instructions, illustrations and patterns.
It is hard back, 151 glossy pages and 9-1/4 x 12-1/4 in size


THREE-DIMENSIONAL DESIGN ($18.95)
by Katie Pasquini
C&T Publishing, Lafayette, CA  1988

Detailed discussion of how to make objects appear three-dimensional.
Lots of her quilts (in color).


TENDER LOVING COVERS
by Toni Phillips and Juanita Simonich

This is a WONDERFUL book of children's quilts with great designs,
mostly pieced.  They are crib/wall quilt size but there is no reason
they could not be incorporated into a large quilt, if you wish.  One
quilt is called Wheels & More Wheels and has a tow truck, fire
engine, ambulance, and police car, so it is not strictly trucks.  In
addition to this, there are the following:  Astronaut, farm, cowboy,
circus, zoo, christmas, a school quilt.


TAKING THE MATH OUT OF MAKING PATCHWORK QUILTS ($6.95)
by Bonnie Leman & Judy Martin
Leman Publications 1981

Charts, tables, measurements, sizes, facts, figures, and helpful information
for planning quilts.  A must for every quilter.


TWENTY LITTLE PATCHWORK QUILTS

TEMPLATES FOR 171 NINE-PATCH QUILT BLOCKS
by Rita Weiss
American School of Needlework 1989

Good book of 9-patch blocks in 10, 12 and 14 inch sizes


TIPS FOR QUILTERS
by Rachel Pellman
Good Books, Intercourse, PA  1993

A handbook of hints, shortcuts, and practical suggestions from experienced
quilters.
-----
This is a great book full of all sorts of useful ideas.  BUT don't read
it at bedtime or you will quilt ALL night long and not get any sleep!!!  I
recommend this book.


TWENTIETH CENTURY QUILTS 1900-1950
by Thos. K. Woodard & Blanche Greenstein


TIMELESS TREASURES, A Complete Guide to Rotary Cutting
by Nancy Johnson-Srebo
RCW Publishing

Nancy's instructions are clear and concise, and she shows readers how
to cut almost any shape, while using your rotary cutter and ruler.  Also
included are instructions for specific 6"", 8"", and 10"" blocks.
----
I have found the info in this book really helpful.  She goes through how to cut
a number of pieces: trapezoids, parallelograms, hexagrams, octograms, etc.  The
nice thing about the book, too, is that she shows you how to do it for right
handed or left handed cutters. There is also a section in the book for those
who use metric measurements.
----
I find [this book] indispensable.  She gives clear instructions and
illustrations to cut any shape with the rotary cutter.  Both right and left
handed illustrations are given.  In the middle of the book there is a chart
for adding on seam allowances to any shape.  It gives both the English and
Metric measurements.  There are also good directions on pressing.

The last part of the book has color photos of blocks and complete directions
for them including cutting, sewing, and pressing.  She includes which direction
to press the seams. (It was great help to me when I was beginning to make
blocks for the first time.)  My only complaint was that there were a couple of
mistakes in the placement of the color photos to the directions.  Some of them
didn't match but were found somewhere else in the book.

BTW, I took the book to a printer and had them put a spiral binding on it so
that it lays flat and stays open when I am using it.


ULTIMATE BOOK OF QUILT BLOCK PATTERNS, THE
by Judy Martin
Crosley-Griffith Publishing 1988

Excellent book, lots of of various sizes.
----
This book is my most favorite, and most used, of all time.

objects.
5. Each process then does an All-to-All reduction of the “k” centroid vectors. Thus, after each
iteration, an all-to-all reduction synchronizes the “k” centroid vectors across all processors.

Where All Roads Meet: Modular Exponentiation
   primes_l[0] contains p − 1, from which we obtain the modulus in p_l.
    As candidates a for the sought-after primitive root only natural numbers greater than or equal to 2 are tested. If a is a square, then a cannot be a primitive root modulo p, since then already a(p−1)/2 ≡ 1 mod p, and the order of a must be less than φ(p) = p − 1. In this case a_l is incremented. We test whether a_l is a square with the function issqr_l() (cf. Section 10.3).
 if (issqr_l (a_l, t_l))
 {
  inc_l (a_l);
 }
i = 1;
do {
   div_l (primes_l[0], primes_l[i++], t_l, junk_l);
   mexpkm_l (a_l, t_l, t_l, p_l);
  }
   The calculation of t ← a(p−1)/pi mod p takes place in two steps. All prime factors pi are tested in turn; we use Montgomery exponentiation. If a primitive root is found, it is output in a_l.

As a second example for the application of exponentiation we consider the encryption procedure of ElGamal, which as an extension of the Diffie–Hellman procedure also provides security in the matter of the difficulty of computing discrete logarithms, since breaking the procedure is equivalent to solving the Diffie–Hellman problem (cf. page 119). Pretty good privacy (PGP), the workhorse known throughout the world for encrypting and signing e-mail and documents whose development goes back essentially to the work of Phil Zimmermann, uses the ElGamal procedure for key management (see [Stal], Section 12.1).
A participant A selects a public and associated private key as follows. ElGamal key generation
1. A chooses a large prime number p such that p − 1 has a large prime divisor close to (p − 1)/2 (cf. page 388) and a primitive root a of the multiplicative group Z×p as above (cf. page 120).
2. Achoosesarandomnumberxwith1 ≤ x < p−1andcomputes b := ax mod p with the aid of Montgomery exponentiation.
3. As public key A uses the triple  p, a, b A , and the associated secret key is  p, a, x A.
Using the public key triple  p, a, b A a participant B can now encrypt a messageM ∈{1,...,p−1}andsendittoA.Theprocedureisasfollows.
Protocol for encryption à la ElGamal
1. Bchoosesarandomnumberywith1≤y<p−1.
2. Bcalculatesα:=ay modpandβ:=Mby modp=M(ax)y modp. 3. B sends the cryptogram C := (α, β) to A.
4. A computes from C the plain text using M = β/αx modulo p.
Since
β β (ax)y
αx ≡ (ax)y ≡M(ax)y ≡M modp,
the procedure works. The calculation of β/αx is carried out by means of a multiplication βαp−1−x modulo p.
   122
The size of p should be, depending on the application, 1024 bits or longer (see Table 17-1), and for the encryption of different messages M1 and M2 unequal random values y1 à= y2 should be chosen, since otherwise, from
β1 M1by M1 =y=
β2 M2b M2
it would follow that knowledge of M1 was equivalent to knowledge of M2. In view of the practicability of the procedure one should note that the cryptogram C is twice the size of the plain text M , which means that this procedure has a higher transmission cost than others.
The procedure of ElGamal in the form we have presented has an interesting weak point, which is that an attacker can obtain knowledge of the plain text with a small amount of information. We observe that the cyclic group Z×p contains the subgroup U := { ax | x even } of order (p − 1)/2 (cf. [Fisc], Chapter 1). If nowb = ax orα = ay liesinU,thenthisholds,ofcourse,foraxy.Ifthisisthe case and the encrypted text β is also in U, then M = βa−xy is in U as well. The same holds if axy and β are both not contained in U . In the other two cases, in which precisely one of axy and β does not lie in U, then M is also not in U. The following criteria provide information about this situation:
1. axy ∈ U ⇔ (ax ∈ U or ay ∈ U). This, and whether also β ∈ U, is tested with
2. Forallu∈Z×p ,u∈U ⇔u(p−1)/2 =1.
One may ask how bad it might be if an attacker could gain such information about M. From the point of view of cryptography it is a situation difficult to accept, since the message space to be searched is reduced by half with little effort. Whether in practice this is acceptable certainly depends on the application. Surely, it is a valid reason to be generous in choosing the length of a key.
Furthermore, one can take some action against the weakness of the procedure, without, one hopes, introducing new, unknown, weaknesses: The multiplication Mby mod p in step 2 of the algorithm can be replaced with an encryption operation V (H (axy ) , M ) using a suitable symmetric encryption procedure V (such as Triple-DES, IDEA, or Rijndael, which has become the new advanced encryption standard; cf. Chapter 11) and a hash function H (cf. page 398) that so condenses the value axy that it can be used as a key for V .
So much for our examples of the application of modular exponentiation. In number theory, and therefore in cryptography as well, modular exponentiation is a standard operation, and we shall meet it repeatedly later on, in particular in Chapters 10 and 17. Furthermore, refer to the descriptions and numerous applications in [Schr] as well as in the encyclopedic works [Schn] and [MOV].

CHAPTER 7 Bitwise and
    Logical Functions
And sprinkled just a bit Over each banana split.
—TomLehrer, “InMyHomeTown”
“Contrariwise,” continued Tweedledee, “if it was so, it might be; and if it were so, it would be: but as it isn’t, it ain’t. That’s logic.”
—LewisCarroll, ThroughtheLooking-Glass
IN THIS CHAPTER WE SHALL present functions that carry out bitwise operations on CLINT objects, and we shall also introduce functions for determining the equality and size of CLINT objects, which we have already used quite a bit.
Among the bitwise functions are to be found the shift operations, which shift a CLINT argument in its binary representation by individual bit positions, and certain other functions taking two CLINT arguments that enable the direct manipulation of the binary representation of CLINT objects. How such operations can be applied to arithmetic purposes is most clearly seen in the shift operations described below, but we have also seen, in Section 4.3, how the bitwise AND operation can be used in reduction modulo a power of two.
7.1  Shift Operations
Necessity devises all manner of shifts. —Rabelais
The simplest way to multiply a number a with the representation a = (an−1an−2 ...a0)B to the base B by a power Be is to “shift a to the left by e digits.” This works with the binary representation exactly as it does in our familiar decimal system:
aBe = (aˆn+e−1aˆn+e−2 . . . aˆeaˆe−1 . . . aˆ0)B ,
125
Chapter 7
where
aˆn+e−1 = an−1, aˆn+e−2 = an−2, . . . ,
aˆe =a0, aˆe−1 =0, ..., aˆ0 =0.
For B = 2 this corresponds to multiplication of a number in binary representation by 2e, while for B = 10 it corresponds to multiplication by a power of ten in the decimal system.
In the analogous procedure for whole-number division by powers of B the digits of a number are “shifted to the right”:
 a 
Be = (aˆn−1 . . . aˆn−eaˆn−e−1aˆn−e−2 . . . aˆ0)B ,
where
aˆn−1 = ··· = aˆn−e = 0, aˆn−e−1 = an−1, aˆn−e−2 = an−2,...,aˆ0 = ae.
For B = 2 this corresponds to integer division of a number in binary representation by 2e, and the analogous result holds for other bases.
Since the digits of CLINT objects are represented in memory in binary form, CLINT objects can easily be multiplied by powers of two by shifting left, where the next digit to the right is shifted into each place where a digit has been shifted left, and the binary digits left over on the right are filled with zeros.
In an analogous way CLINT objects can be divided by powers of two by shifting each binary digit to the right into the next lower-valued digit. Digits left free at the end are either filled with zeros or ignored as leading zeros, and at each stage in the process (shifting by one digit) the lowest-valued digit is lost.
The advantage of this process is clear: Multiplication and division of a CLINT object a by a power of two 2e are simple, and they require at most e àlogB aà shift operations to shift each USHORT value by one binary digit. Multiplication and division of a by a power Be uses only àlogB aà operations for storing USHORT values.
In the following we shall present three functions. The function shl_l() executes a rapid multiplication of a CLINT number by 2, while the function shr_l() divides a CLINT number by 2 and returns the integer quotient.
Lastly, the function shift_l() multiplies or divides a CLINT type a by a power of two 2e. Which operation is executed is determined by the sign of the exponent e of the power of two that is passed as argument. If the exponent is positive, then the operation is multiplication, while if it negative, then division is carried out. If e has the representation e = Bk + l, l < B, then shift_l() carries out the multiplication or division in (l + 1) àlogB aà operations on USHORT values.
All three functions operate modulo (Nmax + 1) on objects of CLINT type. They are implemented as accumulator functions, and thus they change their CLINT operands in that they overwrite the operand with the result of the operation. The functions test for overflow, respectively underflow. However, in shifting, underflow cannot really arise, since in those cases where more positions are to
 126
be shifted than there are digits the result is simply zero, almost as it is in real life. The status value E_CLINT_UFL for underflow then merely indicates that there was less to shift than was required, or, in other words, that the power of two by which division was to be carried out was larger than the dividend, and so the quotient is zero. The three functions are implemented in the following manner.

   Notes:     Supposed to be easier after the first couple of days, since
              your appetite goes. In a UK prison, you can't be force-fed
              unless you give permission first, or are diagnosed insane,
              but I don't know whether this is the same in other countries.
              Beware - relatives might give permission on your behalf if you
              are unconsious.

17. DRIVING INTO BRIDGE SUPPORT AT 100 MPH
   Time:      Hopefully instantanious
   Available: Fast car, motorway, unprotected bridge....
   Certainty: So-so, put a couple of cans of petrol on the passenger seat to
              make it certain, & USE YOUR SEATBELT
   Notes:     Bridges are usually protected in the UK, don't know about USA.
              Avoid being thrown out of the car by using the seatbelt, and
              put petrol (in cans or just splashed about) near to the driver's
              seat just to make certain.

18. SHOTGUN
   Time:      Instantanious if you are lucky
   Available: Difficult in UK, easier in USA (due to gun laws)
   Certainty: Fairly certain
   Notes:     12-gauge shotgun with 3 inch Magnum shells with #2 to #000
              buckshot. See ""Bullet"" for other points. This is the recommended
              way to die by firearm. Apparently the shells suggested here
              are ""extreme overkill"", but thats the point really...

19. ENLIST (silly)
   Time:      Jan 15 or later
   Available: Just pop down to the local army office & sign on as a squaddie
   Certainty: Be a ""hero"". Life expectancy in a battle is 20 minutes
   Notes:     I don't think this is an entirely serious suggestion,
              particularly since only 10% ever see the front line, and only
              a few of those ever see combat.

20. PENCILS UP YOUR NOSE, BANG DOWN ONTO TABLE
   Time:      Seconds or never
   Available: All you need is a couple of sharp pencils and a table
   Certainty: Very uncertain
   Notes:     This is a myth, I think, since the pencils would go into your
              frontal lobes, which are basically optional! This is the
              legendary ""exam suicide"". Fine if you want a DIY frontal-
              lobotomy rather than death!

21. GETTING SOMEONE TO MURDER YOU
   Time:      Depends on method used
   Available: Know any murderous psychopaths? No, not the tax people...
   Certainty: Depends on method used, & dedication of murderer
   Notes:     Forget it. Unless you contract someone to do it, the chances
              are that you are going to wake up in hospital without your
              wallet. If you do contract someone, how are you going to pay
              them? Can't take them to court for running off with your
              money and not doing the job.

22. MAKE YOURSELF INTO AN H-BOMB (another silly one)
   Time:      Speed of light over 1/2 metre (couple of nanoseconds)
   Available: Nuke (fission OR fusion), 10 litres of heavy water
   Certainty: 100%
   Notes:     Drink the heavy water for several days, strap yourself to
              the nuke, and press the button. If you retained a couple of
              litres of the heavy water, the additional yield should be
              .02 * c^2 (joules?). The problem here is getting hold of the
              nuke without anyone noticing. If you are discovered before you
              trigger the gadget, the city authorities are liable to be
              somewhat irate. Also heavy water is a poison, so you might not
              survive that long anyway.

23. MICROMACHINES/NANOCOMPUTERS (science fiction)
   Time:      years or a fraction of a second - depends how you look at it
   Available: in 50 years time?
   Certainty: Good assuming that the technology is developed
   Notes:     Basically, this involves a 'replicator' panel. You program it
              to replicate yourself, simplifying very slightly, with the
              exception of the urge to use this technique. After a while, you
              turn into a mindless zombie, trudging around from the exit of
              the machine to the entrance, for eternity. Strange philosophical
              implications.

24. SCUBA-DIVING (various fatal 'accidents')
   Time:      see notes -most are minutes/hours
   Available: scuba diving gear, nobody around
   Certainty: see notes
   Notes:     The first method is to rise 30 metres or so without releasing
              your breath. Assuming that you can do it, it should cause your
              lungs to burst. The second is the bends - stay under long enough
              for the nitrogen to dissolve (30 metres for 30 minutes). go up
              rapidly without decompression time. This is unreliable, and
              may cause brain / joint damage. The third way is Carbon Monoxide
              poisoning - fill your tank with it, and stay away from other
              divers. You will fall asleep fairly quickly. See CO in poisons
              section. The final way is oxygen narcosis - however, this means
              that you have to go very deep with an oxygen-rich mix, and
              there are problems associated with that. The advantage of these
              methods is that insurance companies / relatives will assume that
              it was an accident ('misadventure'), with the possible exception
              of the CO poisoning.
              The source of this follows: (from the net)
              ""Rising 30m without exhaling will usually result in an over
              pressured lung, possible subcuteaneous emphazema, collapsed
              lung, death usually from drowning in your own blood. Rather
              painful and usually curable if you are rescued, but fair chance
              of dying if you aren't.
              Building up a high residual nitrogen time (say 30m for 30 min)
              then coming up without decompressing will get you bent fairly
              nicely. You don't feel much, but your joints tend to start
              stiffening up after half an hour. Death is very uncertain,
              coming from a stroke. Brain damage, joint damage etc are most
              likely. Pobably can be recued but some damage certain.
              Oxygen poisoning, going down 50+m until the partial pressure of
              the oxygen reaches a toxic level. Difficult to accomplish, very
              painful to get down that deep, cold pressure etc, possibility
              of nitrogen narcosis and forgetting what you are doing. Probably
              get bent, good chance of rescue.
              CO poisoning, mix a healthy batch of carbon monoxide in your
              tank as you dive, you tend to go to sleep under water, when
              combined with the above methods you have a pretty good winner,
              don't forget to forget your BCD.""
              [ed - whats a BCD?]

25. SUCKING YOUR BRAINS OUT
   Time:      Minutes
   Available: You'd need a Puma (TM) robot, & some other bits
   Certainty: certain, given proper programming
   Notes:     You would need an industrial robot to do this properly. Give
              it a saw attachment, a sucking tube attachment, and program
              it. Make a head restraint. When you are fixed securely into
              the restraint, start the robot's program. It will drill a hole
              in your head, and stick the tube into the hole. Program it to
              wiggle the tube back and forth so that it doesn't miss anything.
              This might work better if you put a stream of water into the
              hole as well, so that the sucking attachment doesn't just suck
              air all the time. Debugging the program could be amusing.

26. MICROWAVES
   Time:      ?
   Available: Source of strong microwave emissions
   Certainty: ?
   Notes:     ?

27. DEHYDRATION
   Time:      a week or so.
   Available: you need to be able to stop medical help.
   Certainty: certain if your will-power stands up to it.
   Notes:     Don't eat or drink. Remember that food contains a high
              proportion of water. Avoiding medical help can be difficult.

28. SKYDIVING 'ACCIDENT'
   Time:      pretty damn quick.
   Available: need to join a skydiving club.
   Certainty: certain.
   Notes:     Join a skydiving club, continue to practise it for a while to
              clear off all suspicions and then once pack your parachute in
              a real mess (preferably knotted up, but not too clearly) and
              then jump. The para will not open and you will reach a terminal
              velocity of 220 km/h (160 mph/120 kn). Death is instant in the
              impact with the Planet Earth.
              This has the advantages of being 'accidental', and your family/
              friends do not have the additional pain and guilt associated
              with suicides.

29. DEATH BY A THOUSAND CUTS; MODERN VERSION
   Time:      variable
   Available: a heck of a lot of razor-wire.. maybe a high-voltage supply
   Certainty: not very good
   Notes:     This is a modern variant of the Arabic 'Death of a thousand
              cuts'. Basically, jump onto a stack of unravelled razor wire,
              and roll around till you die.. it may help to connect a high-
              voltage, low current power supply to the wire, so that you have
              spasms, which should keep you getting cut even when you are
              unconscious. Also, you should make sure that you can't roll off
              the wire.

30. CRUSHING
   Time:      seconds to minutes, depends on car press
   Available: a car press.. any good junkyard
   Certainty: certain as long as you can't escape
   Notes:     This is an elegantly simple one.. get into a car, in a car
              press, and shortly afterwards be squashed to death as your
              body is converted into a red pulp. It may be tricky getting
              the press to trigger, but if you hide in the car someone
              may come along and activate it. There are other ways of
              getting crushed, this just happens to be the most effective
              I can think up on the spur of the moment. Getting yourself
              run over by a fully loaded articulated lorry is quite good.
              You should remember that people quite often survive the actual
              crushing; they die when the weight is taken OFF them.

31. WORLD WAR THREE
   Time:      moments if you are near a militarilly significant site
   Available: happen to be one of the 'key-holders'? president maybe?
   Certainty: pretty certain
   Notes:     All you have to do is trigger world war three. Fire an ICBM
              or three at the Chinese and the Russians... This method has
              the advantage that you take everyone else with you! Trouble
              is, the number of people with the requisite access is minimal,
              and I sort of doubt that any readers of ASH can do this.

32. HEATSTROKE
   Time:      4 hours or more
   Available: Very hot day; no disturbance from neighbours etc
   Certainty: depends on the weather
   Notes:     Basically, the point is to give yourself extreme heatstroke.
              You should pass out after a few hours. Use some aluminium foil
              to direct the sun's heat onto you, to speed up the process
              a bit. Try to reduce the chance of being interuppted, take off
              the phone etc. Obviously, start in the morning! Helps if the
              outside temperature is >100F.

with Spam in class.....However, the situation there is
becoming worse as factions within the school is beginning to
show.  The organization of the Anti-Spam appears to be
revolving around someone called The Thomasrino.
 
     However, our story does not end here.  Raphael Dareau
and ""Gav"" still control the Slingers Of The Spam, Crunch and
Merlin continue spreading it through their school and other
computer networks.  The last recorded event in Spam history
was that Merlin cooked a can of Spam at 12am one fine day and
woke his Mom up with the odor.  She was not a happy camper.
Crunch finally began running a BBS that slings Spam freshly
every night.  However, Raphael Dareau, Merlin, and Crunch (as
well as Balzac) continue to spread the legend.  They continue
to find other computer networks -- and you are sure if they
enter a computer network -- Spam will follow them in and
contaminate the network.

Project # 67  SEED A 1200 SQ. FT. LAWN

    Seeding a lawn is the epitome of 'grunt work'.  Lawn seed and fertilizer 
are not cheap but they seem inexpensive when compared with the cost of the 
labor it takes to grade the topsoil and then spread the seed and fertilizer 
with a push spreader.  You can save more than half of what a landscaper 
charges if you do-it-yourself. 

    To seed a 1200 sq. ft. area a landscape contractor will charge upwards of 
$570.  You can purchase the seed and fertilizer and rent a spreader for $275.  
If you need to remove the existing lawn or the yard needs extensive grading, 
it will cost you considerably more time and money.  A normal job should take 
you two days. 

    Follow up watering is an important part of this job.  Your investment in 
seed and time will dry up and blow away if you neglect your emerging grass.

"
raza1@gmail.com,fun6.txt,"            Everything you'd care to mention,
                     Although, it's not been his intention.

                     One day in Spring he fell again,
                     In love this time with clumsy Gwen.
                     Her two left feet and two left arms,
                     He thought her most appealing charms.

                     Of course you'd have no doubt at all
                     That they were married in the fall,
                     And at the altar said ""I do"",
                     While falling down a time or two.

                     A honeymoon of carefree bliss,
                     They fell off that, they fell off this,
                     But they fell more in love than ever,
                     Having accidents together.

                     Weeks of love, of joy and rapture,
                     Of bruises, cuts, sometimes a fracture,
                     Sweet memories shared of true romance
                     Travelling home by ambulance.

                     But now here comes the tragic part,
                     A bit to wring the hardest heart.
                     They both were fell on by a horse,
                     It was an accident - of course.

                     Life's ups and downs are unremitting,
                     Their end was sad but strangely fitting.
                     An ending flat, yet nice and neat,
                     The horse you see, had four left feet.

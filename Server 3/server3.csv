MK-Ultra.  Part of the project called for the free distribution of
5,000 tablets of LSD through a commune known as Ken Kesey's Merry
Pranksters. LSD's after-effects were then closely studied.
   Kesey, a so-called ""poet'' and convicted drug felon, became famous
for driving around California in a painted- up bus with his commune,
the Merry Pranksters, distributing LSD-laced Kool Aid to the
unsuspecting.
    The effect of LSD is to make the victim psychotic, along with the
inability to discern reality from drug-induced hallucinations. For
many, this psychosis (also called a ""bad trip"") could and did lead to
suicide.  When an individual is given LSD without his knowledge, the
psychosis-producing capabilities of the drug are amplified, and
usually leave the victim with permanent brain damage.
   The organizer of the Monterey festival was John Phillips, a member
of the rock group the Mommas and the Papas.  Phillips, as we shall
see, was a drug pusher and closely tied in with the network of
Satanists around Charles Manson and director Roman Polanski.
    Phillips appointed a board of directors to promote and finance the
concert. The members of the board brought together a network of
British intelligence operatives and Satanists.  The board of directors
included Andrew Oldham (the Rolling Stones manager), the Stones leader
Mick Jagger, Beatle Paul McCartney and Phillips' friend, record
producer Terry Melcher, the son of Doris Day.
   The concert, including the staging and the huge innovative outdoor
amplification, was run by Phillips. It was the first time that an
American audience was exposed to such openly demonic British groups as
The Who, and Jimi Hendrix. At the conclusion of their act, The Who, in
a drug-crazed frenzy, destroyed all their guitars, amplifiers, and
drums. Hendrix simulated masturbation with his guitar, on stage, while
performing at ear-splitting volume levels.
    There was massive, open use of drugs. Author Robert Santelli, in
his book, <Aquarius Rising,> writes ""LSD was in abundance at Monterey.
Tabs of `Monterey Purple' were literally given to anyone wishing to
experiment a little.'' The police made no arrests, setting another
precedent for future outdoor concerts.
   There was a larger scheme in operation. The scheme was tied into
MK-Ultra and it involved using Satanists around Phillips, along with
agents such as Ken Kesey and Timothy Leary. The plan was to turn
nearby San Francisco into a Satanist gaming preserve, mass recruiting
and perverting young run-away teenagers.
   Phillips had earlier written the music to a song called ""San
Francisco'' which sold over 5 million copies. The song called for
youth throughout the country to come to San Francisco ""with flowers in
their hair.'' The song was a rallying cry to tens of thousands who
came flooding into San Francisco in the summer of 1968 to join the new
""hippie'' movement, misnamed the Summer of Love.  Some who came became
the prey for the likes of Charles Manson, who recruited his
cult-""family"" exclusively from runaway youth.


Manson and the Rock Stars

   Charles Manson has been portrayed as a lone psychotic who had
hypnotic power over his ""Family"". In reality, Manson was well-known to
a whole network of Hollywood actors, actresses, promoters, partners
and rock stars, and was providing sex and drugs to many of them.
   In his autobiography, <Papa John,> Phillips tells of an invitation
he received to join Terry Melcher and Beach Boy member Dennis Wilson,
at Wilson's mansion. Wilson said, ""This guy Charlie's here with all
these great-looking chicks. He plays guitar and he's a real wild guy.
He has all these chicks hanging out like servants. You can come over
and just screw any of them you want. It's a great party.''
   Manson's entire ""Family'' moved into the Beach Boys' mansion for
nearly a year. The Beach Boys, who have performed at the White House,
are the top recording group of EMI's subsidiary, Capitol Records.
   On Sunday, August 10, 1969, Manson sent four members of his cult
for their last visit to Melcher's house. This time Melcher wasn't
there, but the actress Sharon Tate, wife of movie director Roman
Polanski, and three others, were. When the group left, Tate and the
others had been savagely mutilated and murdered. As for Phillips, in
June 1980, he was arrested for running a large-scale drug wholesaling
operation.


The Age of Aquarius

   The largest concert after Monterey Pop, the ""Woodstock Music and
Art Fair,'' would be what <Time> magazine celebrated as an ""Aquarian
Festival'' and ""history's largest happening.'' The term ""Aquarian''
was carefully chosen. The Aquarian age signified that the ""Age of
Pisces,'' which is the age of Christ, had come to an end.
   At Woodstock, a small town in upstate New York, nearly half a
million youth gathered to be drugged and brainwashed on a farm. The
victims were isolated, immersed in filth, pumped with psychedelic
drugs, and kept awake continously for three straight days, and all
with the full complicity of the FBI and government officials.
Security for the concert was provided by a hippie commune trained in
the mass distribution of LSD.
   Once again, it would be the networks of British military
intelligence which would be the initiators. Woodstock was the brain
child of Artie Kornfeld, the director of EMI's Capitol Record's,
Contemporary Projects Division. The original funding was provided by
the heir of a large Pennsylvania-based pharmaceutical company, John
Roberts, and two other partners. It was another pharmaceutical
company, the Swiss-based Sandoz Laboratories, which had first
synthesized LSD. Roberts would later be accused of using his company
for the mass drugging of the attendees.
   Little adequate preparations were made for the nearly half a
million people who came. Joel Rosenman, one of the three partners,
writes, as the concert neared, ""Food and water were clearly going to
be in short supply, sanitary facilities overtaxed, tempers short,
drugs overabundant. Worst of all, there was no way for anyone who
wanted to, to leave.'' Sitting in your own excrement was actually part
of the plan, as John Roberts jokingly wrote, ""We're going to hand out
bananas at the gate to bind our patrons.''
   A hippie commune called the Hog Farm, had a special role at
Woodstock.  The Hog Farm was led by a man nicknamed Wavy Graver, who
was a former member of Ken Kesey's MK-Ultra operation, the Merry
Pranksters. Communes like the Hog Farm were commonly found in the
remote parts of California and served as the breeding grounds for
Satanic cults, as well as terrorist groups. Members of these communes
continually interchanged with other communes and were the recruiting
grounds for the Process Church and Manson. Hog Farm member Diane Lake
was a member of Charles Manson's Family, at the time of the massacre
of Sharon Tate and her guests.
   On August 14, one day before the scheduled opening, the entire
festival security force, comprised of 350 off-duty New York City cops,
pulled out. A spokesman for the New York police claimed that no
official arrangement was ever made with the city, a claim the
promoters vehemently denied. In an August 15, 1969 <New York Times>
article, the head of Woodstock's security said, ""Now I don't have any
security at all. I've been struck. We're having the biggest collection
of kids there's ever been in this country without any police
protection.'' Not surprisingly, the Hog Farm was put in charge of
security.
   Woodstock funder and director John Roberts, openly admitted that he
was well aware of the Hog Farm's connection to drug distribution. He
writes, ""their fee was simply transportation to and from the
festival... a peace-keeping force that looked, talked, and smelled
like the crowd would be both highly credible and highly effective...
and the most important, they were wise in the ways of drugs, knowing
good acid from bad, good trips from bummers, good medicine from
poison, etc.''
      The Hog Farm at the time was living in New Mexico's mountains.
Roberts chartered a Boeing 727, at a cost of $17,000, and flew 100 of
them to New York.
   To clear the final path for the planned drugging of half a million
youngsters, the district attorney for the area agreed privately that
there would be no arrests or prosecutions for violations of drug laws.
John Roberts writes, ""The District Attorney...recognized early on that
many of our customers would be using illegal drugs, but also
recognized that such use would be the least of our problems over the
course of the weekend. He acted, therefore, with compassion and good
grace throughout.''  Roberts also writes that he was meeting
continuously with the FBI up to and including one day before the start
of the concert, and had their full cooperation.


The Experiment Begins

   Two days before the scheduled start of the concert, 50,000 kids had
already arrived in Woodstock. Drugs immediately began to circulate.
Many people brought their babies and, as Roberts says, even they were
drugged.  Roberts writes that at a nearby lake, ""the tots swam naked,
smoked grass, and got into the music.''
   A poll conducted at the festival by the <New York Times> showed
that 99 percent of those attending were using marijuana. Local sheriff
deputies, totally overwhelmed, reported that no arrests were being
made for drug use. The <New York Times> of August 17 quoted one
deputy,'' If we did (make arrests), there isn't enough space in
Sullivan or the next three counties to put them in.''
   The use of marijuana was not the worst. Following the design of the
original MK-Ultra project, the mass distribution of LSD came next,
much of it in LSD-laced Coca Cola, as Kesey's Pranksters had done five
years earlier.  Roberts jokingly relates the following, ""a
particularly abrasive cop ....had been handed an LSD-spiked Coke while
directing traffic. Long after all automobiles in the area had
congealed to a standstill, the hardhat was still out on the road
waving them on. Finally they led him away.''
   For the next three days, the nearly half a million young people
that arrived wer

one's growth.  Taler athletes are usually naturally selected for 
other sports in what could be called a sort of ""sports Darwinism.""  
Having a more compact torso and short limbs allows the bodybuilder 
to attain the proper proportions needed to win a contest.  As a 
result, bodybulding tends to naturally select short or medium-
statured men and women.

There are numerous tall bodybuilders, such as  Lou Ferrigno 
(6'5"") and Dr. Lynne Pirie (5'9"").   Scientists have determined 
that any type of physical activity will tend to stimulate height 
increases rather than inhibit them.  Proper diet can also result 
in height increase, and bodybuilders consistently follow health-
promoting diets.  Certainly, parents needn't worry that their sons 
and daughters will end up being short in stature simply because 
they decide to become bodybuilders.

5.  BODYBULDING TRAINING WILL WRECK YOUR BACK, KNEES, ELBOWS, AND 
OTHER JOINTS.  Such spinal or joint injuries are much more common 
in other sports than in bodybuilding.  As long as you follow the 
warm-up procedures we will outline, and maintain the correct 
biomechanical (body) positions for each exercise, you needn't fear 
damaging your joints through bodybuilding training.

6.  BODYBUILDING TRAINING CAN SLOW YOU DOWN.  As with the myth 
about becoming muscle-bound, scientists proved more than 30 years 
ago that heavy weight training improves speed rather than 
detracting from it.  Reaction time can't be improved through 
weight workouts, but a stronger muscle can contract faster and 
more strongly, thereby moving a limb more quickly.  S print speed, 
for example, is a direct function of thigh and calf strength.  In 
modern athletics, virtually all athletes include weight training 
in their overall conditioning regimes.  They certainly wouldn't do 
this if heavy weight workouts inhibited their speed, because it 
could reduce their athletic ability.
 
                               

    ""Buying Your Massachusetts Automobile Insurance"" has been 
prepared for you by the Massachusetts Division of Insurance as 
part of our continuing effort to inform consumers on the 
detailed and sometimes complex aspects of purchasing automobile 
insurance in the Commonwealth.  This guide outlines the basic 
automobile coverages you are required by law to purchase, as 
well as the coverages available to you on an optional basis.  
We have also included a description of the newly amended Safe 
Driver Insurance Plan - the Commonwealth's merit rating plan 
which offers premium credits to policyholders who practice safe 
driving habits.  Furthermore, this guide provides information 
on filing complaints and money-saving tips for reducing your 
premium without sacrificing insurance protection.  

    If you receive this pamphlet after you purchase your 1990 
automobile insurance and you wish to make changes in the 
coverage, limits, deductibles or discounts, contact your agent 
or company.  They can assist you.  If you are not satsified 
call us.  Our Consumer Service Section can be contacted at 
(617) 727-7189, X 300.


    As you know, the Automobile Insurance Reform Act of 1988 
succeeded in updating our no-fault system, lowered the costs of 
repairing damaged vehicles, expanded consumers' choices and 
initiated long-term, cost-saving efforts that will benefit 
consumers into the 1990s. 

The 1988 Reform Law addressed the rising costs in the system 
through both tort law changes, such as the increase in the tort 
threshold from $500 to $2000, and coverage changes, including 
the increase in Personal Injury Protection (PIP) from $2,000 to 
$8,000, and the coordination of benefits between health 
insurance and PIP coverage.  Consumers have realized reduced 
premiums from additional coverage changes and newly available 
discounts.  The Reform Law increased the standard deductible 
from $300 to $500 for both collision and comprehensive 
coverages and created an optional $100 glass deductible.  Also, 
additional rated reductions are now available for consumers 
whose vehicles are equipped with both an anti-theft device and 
an auto recovery system, and for cars equipped with air bags or 
passive restraint devices. 

A new Safe Driver Insurance Plan will mean substantially 
reduced premiums for long time good drivers.  

This year, a new Safe Driver Insurance Plan takes effect.  The 
aim of the Plan is to make the Massachusetts merit rating 
system more fair by ending the subsidization of unsafe drivers 
by good drivers.  The Plan, known as a ""bonus malus"" system, 
can be compared to a ladder.  The bottom of the ladder 
represents the lowest premiums and the top of the ladder 
represents the highest premiums.  Drivers will be assigned 
credits and surcharges that are a percentage of the premium for 
specific coverages.  Each year, drivers with an incident-free 
record move down one step on the ladder and earn a premium 
credit.  Drivers who have at-fault accidents or certain traffic 
violations move up the ladder a number of steps equal to the 
number of unsafe driver points assigned and will be assessed a 
surcharge for each point.  Each step up or down the ladder is 
equal to 7% of the driver's premium for liability coverage 
(bodily injury, PIP, and property damage liability) and 5% of 
the premium for collision coverage.

       ""Buying Your Massachusetts Automobile Insurance"" has 
been prepared for you by the Massachusetts Division of 
Insurance.  This guide contains a description of the basic 
coverages you are required by law to purchase, as well as the 
coverages available to you on an optional basis.  We have also 
included information on filing complaints and money-saving tips 
for reducing your premium without sacrificing insurance 
protection.
       Many motorists pay a higher premium than they should 
because they choose coverages that do not suit their needs.  
The most common and costly mistake consumers make when buying 
automobile insurance is to renew their policy without assessing 
how their individual insurance needs might have changed.  
Instead, before you renew your policy, reevaluate your 
insurance choices and your eligibility for the many discount 
opportunities.  Also, buy only the coverage you need and select 
deductibles you can afford. 
       The Safe Driver Insurance Plan (SDIP), which offers 
premium credits to motorists who practice safe driving habits, 
has been significantly changed for 1990.  Although automobile 
insurance will always be expensive in an urban, densely 
populated state like Massachusetts, you can reduce the cost of 
your premium an average of $140 by driving safely and 
maintaining an incident-free driving record.  Although the Plan 
is complex, I urge you to read Part 4 of this guide carefully 
for information on the Plan's many new improvements. 
       Please keep in mind that this guide is not meant to be a 
substitute for the Massachusetts Automobile Insurance Policy.  
Always refer to your Policy for the exact terms and conditions 
of your automobile insurance.  If you receive this guide after 
you have renewed your policy for 1990, and you wish to make 
changes in your coverage, limits, deductibles or discounts, 
contact your agent or company.  They can assist you in making 
the necessary changes.  If you need further information on 
automobile insurance, contact the Division of Insurance at 280 
Friend Street, Boston, MA 02114 (617) 727-7189 or 436 Dwight 
Street, Room 338, Springfield, MA 01103, (413) 784-1190.  
       


                               Timothy H. Gailey

                     COMPULSORY COVERAGES

       Since 1927, under Massachusetts insurance law, motorists 
have been required to purchase compulsory motor vehicle 
liability insurance.  All registered motor vehicles in the 
Commonwealth must be insured under Parts 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the 
Massachusetts Automobile Insurance Policy.  When you buy this 
insurance, you receive financial protection in case you become 
involved in an accident.  
       Of course, not all insurance-buying decisions are simple 
or clear-cut, because you cannot predict the future.  When in 
doubt, remember that it is more important to have insurance 
against large losses which could threaten your standard of 
living than smaller losses that you can afford to pay yourself. 

Compulsory Coverages
       Part 1: BODILY INJURY TO OTHERS will pay for the damages 
to anyone injured or killed by your auto in Massachusetts up to 
a limit of $10,000 per person and $20,000 per accident.
       Part 1 applies whether your auto is being driven by you 
or by someone else with your permission.  However, this 
coverage never covers injuries to the driver of your auto or to 
guests in your auto.
       Limits higher than $10,000 per person and $20,000 per 
accident and coverage for injuries incurred by guest occupants 
of your auto and for out-of-state accidents may be purchased 
under Part 5.  

       Part 2: PERSONAL INJURY PROTECTION (PIP), provides 
payment of up to $8,000 to you, anyone driving your auto with 
your consent, anyone living in your household, passengers in 
your auto and pedestrians struck by your auto, for expenses 
incurred as the result of an accident, without regard to 
fault.  PIP pays for medical expenses, replacement services and 
75% of any lost wages.  
       If you already have good health insurance and disability 
health plans - provided by your employer, for example - you 
should consider taking a deductible and excluding yourself and 
the members of your household from this coverage.  However, 
remember that even with a comprehensive health insurance plan, 
you would not be provided with coverage for lost wages and 
replacement services, unless your employer offers a wage 
continuation program.          



       Even with a large deductible for you and members of your 
household, guests in your automobile and pedestrians are still 
fully covered.

       Part 3: BODILY INJURY CAUSED BY AN UNINSURED AUTO 
protects you, members of your household, and guests in your 
automobile against losses caused by an uninsured automobile, or 
from a hit-and-run accident, unless the household member or 
guest is protected by their own or another auto insurance 
policy.  In addition, this coverage protects you and members of 
your household as pedestrians against injuries caused by an 
uninsured auto or a hit-and-run driver.  
       Compulsory uninsured automobile coverage requires a 
minimum limit of $10,000 per person and $20,000 per accident.  
Increasing this coverage makes good sense for most people, 
especially for persons who travel outside of Massachusetts, as 
compulsory auto insurance is not mandatory in all states. 
       Please keep in mind that you can purchase Part 3 
coverage with limits that are lower than but not higher than 
the limits you purchase for Part 5.  It is recommended that you 
purchase this coverage in limits equal to the limits you 
purchase under Part 5.
       Part 4: DAMAGE TO SOMEONE ELSE'S PROPERTY pays for 
property damage and for costs resulting from the loss of the 
use of property damaged from an accident caused by you, a 
household member or anyone using your auto with permission.  
This Part never covers damage to your automobile or property.  
       The minimum amount required is $5000.  However, you 
should consider purchasing this insurance with higher limits.  
Today's new car and repair prices being what they are, a limit 
of $25,000 is a good choice for many people.  




                      OPTIONAL COVERAGES

       There are eight other coverages available to you in 
addition to the compulsory insurance, and in general it is up 
to you whether you purchase them or not.  These optional 
coverages provide additional protection against financial loss 
resulting from an automobile accident.  If you have borrowed 
money to purchase your automobile, your lender may legally 
require you to carry the optional coverages, Collision (Part 7) 
and Comprehensive (Part 9).
.  Your insurance company may refuse to issue you some optional 
coverages because of certain prior driving violations or 
insurance-related crimes.  

Optional Coverages
       Part 5: OPTIONAL BODILY INJURY TO OTHERS allows you to 
extend the protection you must purchase under Part 1, by 
offering coverage above the $10,000/$20,000 limit for injuries 
caused by you in Massachusetts, in other parts of the United 
States and in Canada.  
       Unlike the compulsory Bodily Injury insurance, Part 5 
will pay for injuries to guests of your automobile and for 
injuries to others caused by any person who is using your car 
with your consent.
       To protect your assets and future income, it makes good 
sense to buy higher limits under this Part; $100,000 per person 
and $300,000 per accident will meet most drivers needs.  Such 
additional coverage is valuable since, considering the rising 
costs of medical and hospital care, court judgments can easily 
exceed $20,000. 

       Part 6: MEDICAL PAYMENTS covers medical expenses for 
injuries resulting from any accident involving you, any 
household member and any passenger, once the limits provided 
under Part 2, Personal Injury Protection have been exhausted.  
It does not cover lost wages.  Drivers who have comprehensive 
health insurance plans may not need the extra coverage provided 
under Part 6.  
       You should, however, think about buying this Part if you 
and your household members do not already have adequate health 
insurance or if you want this protection for passengers in your 
automobile.

       Part 7: COLLISION insurance pays for damage to your 
automobile caused by a collision regardless of fault.  The cost 
of collision protection varies with the model and year of your 
automobile, where it is garaged and the operator 
classification.  Because it pays for damages regardless of 
fault, this Part is expensive to purchase.  
       Unfortunately, there is no good rule-of-thumb to use 
when purchasing Collision coverage.  If your automobile is 
financed, your lender may require you to carry this Part on 
your policy.  However, if you own your automobile outright, 
your decision to purchase Collision should depend on whether or 
not you can afford to replace your automobile without help from 
your insurance company.



       A deductible is the portion of each claim you agree not 
to be covered for.  For example, if you purchase Collision with 
the standard $500 deductible and you suffer a loss of $700, you 
will collect $200 from your insurance company.  If a loss of 
less than $500 occurs, you are responsible for the entire 
amount.  Collision protection can be purchased at a much lower 
price when you purchase a deductible higher than the standard 
$500 deductible.  Choose the larger deductible if you can 
afford to pay a larger loss out of your own pocket.  You also 
have the option to purchase the more expensive $300 
deductible.  The choice is not an easy one, so take the time to 
evaluate your financial circumstances when purchasing this and 
any other available deductible. 
       Your company may require a $500 Collision or Limited 
Collision deductible if you have had a major at-fault accident 
within the previous three years. 
       WAIVER OF DEDUCTIBLE coverage may be purchased at a 
higher premium if you opt to purchase Collision coverage.  The 
Waiver of Deductible allows any deductible you choose to be 
ignored in cases of fault on the part of another identifiable 
driver.  The deductible would not be waived in a hit-and-run 
accident, even if the unidentifiable party was completely at 
fault.  
       You might choose to purchase the Waiver of Deductible 
for the benefit it offers if you are involved in an accident 
caused by an identifiable, insured driver.  While many 
policyholders are willing to pay the additional cost for the 
Waiver of Deductible's convenience, others view the benefits as 
too few to justify the extra premium.  
       NOTE:  Your failure to list a household member as an 
operator on your policy may have very serious consequences.  
Your insurer will not pay for a Collision loss for an accident 
which occurs while your auto is being operated by a household 
member who is not listed as an operator on your policy.  
Payment is withheld when the household member, if listed, would 
require the payment of additional premium on your policy 
because the household member would be classified as an 
inexperienced operator or a higher rating step would be 
assigned under the Safe Driver Insurance Plan. 

       Part 8: LIMITED COLLISION also pays for damages to your 
automobile caused by a collision, although in limited 
circumstances.  Because this coverage is not as broad as Part 
7, its cost is considerably less.
       This coverage will not pay for one-car accidents, 
accidents in which you are more than 50% at fault or for 
accidents where the owner or driver of the other vehicle cannot 


be identified.  Limited Collision will pay for most other 
accidents and offers the convenience of dealing with your own 
insurance company.   
       If you are willing to pay for the damage you might cause 
to your auto, or if the value of your auto does not justify 
purchasing full Collision coverage, then Limited Collision or 
no collision coverage is your best bet.  
       You may reduce or eliminate the $500 standard Limited 
Collision deductible for an extra premium.
       NOTE:  Your failure to list a household member as an 
operator on your policy may have very serious consequences.  
Your insurer will not pay for a Limited Collision loss for an 
accident which occurs while your auto is being operated by a 
household member who is not listed as an operator on your 
policy.  Payment is withheld when the household member, if 
listed, would require the payment of additional premium on your 
policy because the household member would be classified as an 
inexperienced operator or a higher rating step would be 
assigned under the Safe Driver Insurance Plan.

       Part 9: COMPREHENSIVE coverage will pay for losses which 
are not caused by a collision, such as fire, theft and 
vandalism losses.  In addition, this insurance will pay you up 
to $15 a day for substitute transportation until your stolen 
auto is recovered (up to a limit of $450).
       Comprehensive coverage does not insure personal 
belongings in your auto unless they have been made a permanent  
part of your automobile.  This means that clothing is never 
covered, but a C.B. radio permanently installed in the opening 
of the dash or console is.
       The standard deductible for Comprehensive coverage is 
$500, although you have the option to purchase a $300 
deductible.  As with the Collision coverage, buying back to the 
lower deductible will raise your premium cost.  Seriously 
consider choosing a larger deductible than the standard one if 
you can afford to pay a larger loss out of your own pocket.  
You should also consider installing an anti-theft device and/or 
a signal-activated vehicle recovery system.  Anti-theft 
equipment and recovery system discounts, which are discussed in 
the Saving Money Section, range from 5% to 35%.  
       You also have the option of purchasing a $100 deductible 
on glass claims.  If you take a deductible, you will reduce the 
cost of your Comprehensive coverage by  %, however if you have 
a claim for a broken windshield or other glass damage, you will 
have to pay for the first $100 of that damage.   




       Part 10: SUBSTITUTE TRANSPORTATION pays up to $15 a day 
for car rental, taxicab fares and other transportation costs 
(up to a limit of $450).
       You should carefully consider whether you need this 
coverage.  Claims for loss of use caused by another driver are 
generally payable under that driver's Damage To Someone Else's 
Property coverage (Part 4).  Comprehensive Coverage (Part 9) 
provides reimbursement for loss of use resulting from theft.  
Moreover, Substitute Transportation coverage does not pay under 
all conditions.  If your auto is being repaired or replaced 
because of damages that would be covered under Collision 
coverage (Part 7), you can collect under Part 10.  There is no 
coverage, however, if your auto is merely in the shop for 
routine repairs.
       Please note that if you are under the legal age or have 
a poor credit rating you may be unable to rent a vehicle.  
However, you do remain eligible for the reimbursement of 
transportation expenses.  

       Part 11: TOWING AND LABOR will pay up to $25 for towing 
and labor charges each time your automobile breaks down.  The 
cost of replacement parts is not covered and labor is covered 
only to get your auto going again at the place of breakdown.  
       If you belong to a motor club, you may already have 
Towing and Labor coverage - so check your club's benefits 
before purchasing Part 11. 
       Your insurance company may legally refuse to sell you 
Towing and Labor coverage. 

       Part 12: BODILY INJURY CAUSED BY AN UNDERINSURED AUTO 
will pay damages for bodily injury to people injured or killed 
as the result of certain accidents caused by someone who does 
not have enough insurance, up to the difference between the 
total amount collected from the automobile bodily injury 
liability insurance covering the owner and the operator of the 
auto and the limits you purchased for this coverage.  
       Your company will pay damages to or for you, or any 
household member, unless the household member has his or her 
own Massachusetts auto policy or is covered by a Massachusetts 
auto policy of a household member providing similar coverage 
with higher limits, if you are injured as a pedestrian or while 
occupying an auto you do not own.  It will also pay damages to 
or for anyone else occupying your auto unless that person has 
his or her own Massachusetts auto policy or is covered by a 
Massachusetts auto policy of any household member providing 
similar coverage.




Below are some examples of how this coverage works:
EXAMPLE 1 - You do not buy the Underinsured Auto coverage.  You 
are injured in an auto accident caused by the other driver who 
is legally responsible for your injuries.  Your damages total 
$20,000.  The other driver's Bodily Injury liability limit is 
$10,000.  You can collect $10,000 from the other driver's 
insurance, but you must sue the other driver to collect the 
other $10,000.  If the other driver has no assets, you could 
suffer a loss of $10,000.

EXAMPLE 2 - You purchase Underinsured Auto coverage limits of 
$20,000 per person; $40,000 per accident.  Your damages are 
$30,000.  The other driver's policy provides $10,000 of Bodily 
Injury liability insurance, which you collect from his 
company.  You can only collect an additional $10,000 from your 
company.  This is the difference between the amount collected 
from all automobile Bodily Injury liability limits and your 
Underinsured Auto limit of $20,000 for each person. 

EXAMPLE 3 - You purchase Underinsured Auto coverage limits of 
$20,000 per person; $40,000 per accident.  Your damages are 
$20,000.  The other driver's policy provides $10,000 of Bodily 
Injury liability insurance which you collect from his company.  
Your Underinsured Auto coverage will pay you $10,000 in full 
payment of your outstanding damages.  This is the difference 
between the other driver's Bodily Injury limits and your 
Underinsured Auto coverage limits. 

       Keep in mind that since all registered motor vehicles 
must have the compulsory Bodily Injury limits of $10,000 per 
person; $20,000 per accident, purchasing Underinsured Auto 
coverage limits of $10,000/$20,000 provides little or no 
coverage.  If you choose to purchase Underinsurance coverage, 
you may buy limits that are less than but not higher than the 
limits purchased under Part 5, however it is recommended that 
you buy it in limits equal to the limits you purchase under 
Part 5.  



                         SAVING MONEY

       Getting the discounts you are entitled to, paying 
attention to detail and driving conscientiously can all work to 
keep your insurance costs down.  By following the suggestions 
listed below, you will maximize the available savings.  
       
Be An Alert Shopper
       Before choosing your coverages, limits and deductibles, 
read the Massachusetts Automobile Insurance Policy carefully to 
be certain that you understand the coverages.  Assess your 
driving habits in order to determine the coverages and limits 
you need.  When filling out the application, make sure that you 
complete it accurately in order for your policy to be rated 
properly.  Finally, when you receive your Coverage Selections 
Page, do not file it away without checking to see that the 
coverages, limits, deductibles, discounts and premium are 
correct.  

Review Your Bill
       You do not leave the store without a receipt - and you 
should not buy auto insurance without an itemized bill!
       First, look at your bill to find out whether any part of 
the total cost is for service fees.  Although some agents and 
brokers charge nothing for the additional effort needed to fill 
out various forms or to bring your license plates from the 
Registry, others will charge you a fee for performing such 
services.  However, no agent or broker can charge service fees 
in connection with issuing or renewing your automobile 
insurance policy, nor are you legally bound to pay for any 
other services your agent or broker performs without your 
consent.  
       Your itemized bill should tell you whether you have been 
enrolled in a motor club.  Obviously, if you do not want to 
join a motor club or if you are already a member of a different 
motor club, you should not pay the membership dues.   If you do 
belong to a motor club, check to see if membership includes 
benefits similar to the Towing/Labor and Substitute 
Transportation coverages - there is no point in buying 
duplicate coverage.  
       Of course, the main thing your insurance bill will tell 
you is how much you owe.  According to state law, no company, 
agent or broker can ask you to pay more than 30% of your 
premium before you renew your coverage (although you may pay 
more than 30% if you wish).  However, if you have defaulted on 
a premium payment during the previous twenty-four months,

    16                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  That's open for

    17    discussion.  I would like to hear how people feel

    18    about hearings in the field, whether those ought to be

    19    numerous, limited, whole committees, subcommittees,


    20    specific areas, how we decide where --

    21                DR. RIOS:  I don't know what's out there,

    22    but I think the idea of getting away from Washington


    23    and hearing from people out in the field might be of

    24    some benefit because out there that have something to

    25    say about this.


                                                                         94

     1                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  I agree.


     2                Don?

     3                DR. CUSTIS:  One option we might consider

     4    would be to contract for some focus group sessions on

     5    the part of -- contract with people who know how to


     6    handle a focus group, you know, organize focus groups.

     7                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Yes.

     8                DR. CUSTIS:  And get a sampling of


     9    patients who have been treated.

    10                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  I think that's --

    11                DR. TAYLOR:  I missed something Donald

    12    said.  He was saying contract with --


    13                DR. CUSTIS:  There are commercial outfits,

    14    you know, that do nothing but handle focus groups.

    15                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Don?


    16                Phil?  Sorry.

    17                DR. LANDRIGAN:  Yes.  I think -- I think

    18    field hearings might be useful.  I think that maybe

    19    two topics where they could most fruitfully


    20    concentrate would be on medical care and outreach.  I

    21    think research is probably less likely to be

    22    illuminated by those.


    23                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Elaine?  Did --

    24                DR. LARSON:  Well, just a point of

    25    clarification.  My understanding of outreach here is


                                                                         95

     1    not to discuss how we are going to communicate or go


     2    out, but it's to evaluate government-sponsored

     3    outreach efforts.

     4                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  That's true.

     5                DR. LARSON:  So we're --


     6                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  That's right.  Yes.

     7                DR. LARSON:  To do that two times a year.

     8                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  That's right.  You


     9    are right.

    10                DR. LARSON:  But related to the -- related

    11    to the topic or our assignment --

    12                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Assignment.


    13                DR. LARSON:  In addition to checking out

    14    the 800 numbers I think it would be very useful if

    15    anybody has any information about when they started


    16    and the extent to which they have been used.  It

    17    probably isn't possible to get a good sense.

    18                But you asked a question yesterday about,

    19    okay, we've got these numbers.  Do people know about


    20    them?  How many veterans use the Internet?  How many

    21    people use a computer?  And we need to kind of -- my

    22    sense is our mandate is to look at that.  Are the


    23    appropriate mechanisms being used?

    24                I thought the panels yesterday were very

    25    responsive.  They said, ""we are using multiple


                                                                         96

     1    methods"" etc., etc., which is what you would want to


     2    hear.  But we need to get some sense of what media

     3    campaigns there have been.

     4                Has there been anything on the -- on

     5    television?  On radio there has.  But the question is: 


     6    Is it appropriate?  And is it occurring only at 2:00

     7    a.m.?  Or, what's going on?

     8                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Yes.  And also


     9    newsletters.  You know, what newsletters are going

    10    out?  What kind of mailings?  We ought to archive all

    11    of those and analyze them.

    12                Art?


    13                DR. CAPLAN:  That's a great area for a

    14    contract.  One of the things I have been interested

    15    over the years is working on tissue donation.  And


    16    there are, again, firms that just do a nice job in

    17    tracking.

    18                They can answer the question for you about

    19    who knows about the 800 numbers.  And does anybody


    20    ever read newsletters that go out.  And that sort of

    21    thing.

    22                That's a great place to get somebody with


    23    good expertise on media outreach and let them look at

    24    this.  And they'll call other veterans' samples and

    25    find out who has been looking at what and do they know


                                                                         97

     1    about the numbers and that sort of stuff.


     2                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Yes.  That's a very

     3    good point.  We can look into that.

     4                DR. TAYLOR:  Are there government support

     5    groups at all in relation to Gulf War Veterans


     6    illnesses?  Is there any kind of support group

     7    network?  Does anyone --

     8                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  That's a good


     9    question.

    10                Yes?

    11                DR. RIOS:  Down in San Antonio there's a

    12    group called the Gulf War Veterans Support Group


    13    Network.

    14                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  There is a national

    15    organization of --


    16                DR. TAYLOR:  But are they government-

    17    sponsored?  Or are they on their own with funding from

    18    the outside?

    19                DR. RIOS:  The one in Texas is on its own.


    20                DR. TAYLOR:  Okay.

    21                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  The one I was

    22    contacted by is on its own.


    23                DR. TAYLOR:  Okay.

    24                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Do you know one,

    25    Marguerite?


                                                                         98

     1                DR. KNOX:  My experience has been most of


     2    them are on their own.  However, I would commend them. 

     3    They have a great network.  They got the information

     4    to everybody about this meeting.

     5                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  With the Internet


     6    coming up on line I think we ought to look at, in more

     7    detail, where those computers are going to be, how

     8    useful they are to the vets, how many of them know


     9    about it, how user friendly they are, whether they are

    10    the difficult ones or the easy ones to get into and so

    11    on.

    12                DR. CAPLAN:  One other thing I was going


    13    to comment on about outreach -- if you talk to some of

    14    the schools of communication in addition to Internet

    15    things, it's possible to put on location things like


    16    video disks and other technologies which some people

    17    hope are going to start showing up in the library

    18    system and in other places where people could find

    19    them and know that there's some hope.


    20                That maybe -- in Pennsylvania that there

    21    is going to be this commitment to put a computer

    22    terminal and a CD ROM type player in every library. 


    23    And that's the sort of place where people could go and

    24    get a CD ROM disk that has information about this and

    25    who to report to and that sort of stuff.


                                                                         99

     1                So I think we should think very broadly


     2    both about what's out there now and what might

     3    reasonably be out there that people could really use

     4    that may not own a computer or know anything about

     5    them or some of these other information technologies.


     6                But a lot of cable stations, a lot of

     7    technology coming out there -- it may be that in five

     8    or ten years if we recommend it there could be some


     9    effort to put that into play.  So it's not just the

    10    Internet, there's a lot of other tactics out there to

    11    get information out.

    12                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  So our charge in


    13    outreach really is one to look at what is going on in

    14    outreach now, what we would recommend ought to be in

    15    the outreach, as well as the other aspect that I had


    16    started off on and -- how we outreach.  So we've got

    17    three aspects of outreach there that we'll need to

    18    address.

    19                DR. CAPLAN:  We'll have to get an 800


    20    number.

    21                (Laughter.)

    22                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Do we have an 800


    23    number?

    24                DR. CAPLAN:  No.

    25                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Okay.  We'll talk


                                                                        100

     1    about that.


     2                The next thing I had listed down to take

     3    a look at was the question of the implementation of

     4    past recommendations.  As we know, there have been

     5    others' reports and there have been recommendations.


     6                I don't know that there's been any

     7    systematic review of all the recommendations that have

     8    been made and what's happened to those recommendations


     9    and what is the status of the implementation of those

    10    recommendations.

    11                And Robyn Nishimi and I have been

    12    discussing, you know, what maybe our first focus might


    13    well be.  And it seems to me that that's a logical way

    14    to get at this to start.

    15                Any thoughts about that?


    16                Andrea?

    17                DR. TAYLOR:  I guess all of the

    18    recommendations -- there are so many that have been

    19    listed.  And I guess it goes back to the agencies --


    20    the DOD versus the VA system.

    21                I guess -- is it our responsibility to

    22    accomplish where these recommendations are and try to


    23    investigate the implementations from that end?  And

    24    how will that be accomplished?  I mean, I have a hard

    25    time with OSHA doing follow up on inspections.  So I


                                                                        101

     1    am just --


     2                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  I think to the extent

     3    that it is possible -- and, you know -- for some

     4    recommendations it's going to be easy to find out

     5    whether they are being followed.


     6                Specific recommendations on clinical care

     7    and every physical exam will be very difficult for us

     8    to know whether they are being implemented in the


     9    field.  All we can do is look at whether the

    10    information got out to the field and so on.

    11                Others in terms of the epidemiologic

    12    studies that have been recommended by IOM -- whether


    13    they have been started and where they stand should be

    14    easy for us to find now.

    15                And I do think the President and the White


    16    House are looking for us to take a look at the

    17    recommendations that have been made and let him know

    18    whether they are being implemented or not being

    19    implemented.


    20                DR. TAYLOR:  And make suggestions --

    21                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  And make suggestions.

    22                DR. TAYLOR:  And make suggestions on how


    23    to get them implemented.

    24                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Yes.  That's within

    25    our charge.


                                                                        102

     1                David?


     2                DR. HAMBURG:  Yes.  I think that's very

     3    important to do.  That's why I raised with some of the

     4    government people about what mechanisms of

     5    implementation they had or could construct to pursue


     6    the thought for recommendations it could put out

     7    there.

     8                I think we could ask every relevant agency


     9    their response to perhaps a defined set of

    10    recommendations that have made by serious bodies that

    11    have looked into this up to now.

    12                And their reaction, their commentary --


    13    probably to a considerable extent they have already

    14    reacted.  They may have reason, basis, for rejecting

    15    some of the recommendations.  But the most treacherous


    16    territory is where the response is essentially, ""Yes. 

    17    We agree some day, some how we are going to do this.""

    18                And I think we need, therefore, to press

    19    them for rather specific steps being taken and -- and


    20    questions about mechanisms of implementation.  I asked

    21    twice about this coordinating board yesterday.  And I

    22    have to say the responses, though earnest and in good


    23    faith and pleasant, were not very informative.

    24                I -- it may be that this coordinating

    25    board has real potential to move the agenda of serious


                                                                        103

     1    recommendations toward implementation.  But that isn't


     2    obvious to me from what we heard yesterday.

     3                So I would want to know not only about

     4    their response to major recommendations, especially

     5    converging recommendations, but also about the


     6    mechanisms they have in place or they are thinking of

     7    constructing through which they would be likely to

     8    respond effectively one way or another.


     9                Not assuming that they accept all.  But

    10    yes or no.  But if no, why.  And if yes, what concrete

    11    steps are being taken.

    12                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  John?


    13                DR. BALDESCHWIELER:  There's a significant

    14    danger in asking a large agency such as DOD for their

    15    response to a set of recommendations because they will


    16    assign a staff officer to write you something, which,

    17    you know, typically is not going to be very helpful.

    18                A much more powerful approach, I think, is

    19    to look at the end point.  And to literally once again


    20    look at some cases and see what is happening.  I mean,

    21    see what's really happening at the -- at the point of

    22    care, for example.


    23                And if you find some, you know, outrageous

    24    inconsistency there, that will certainly elicit a

    25    response through the system, I think, much more


                                                                        104

     1    effectively than asking for a bureaucratic response to


     2    a set of recommendations.

     3                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  I -- pardon?

     4                DR. CUSTIS:  So little faith.

     5                (Laughter.)


     6                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  I think that does

     7    vary with the kind of recommendation.  I think the

     8    point is very well taken.  There are some


     9    recommendations that they will tell you, ""Oh, yes.  We

    10    are doing this.""  But you have to go out in the field 

    11    and find out whether they are.

    12                There are other recommendations like we


    13    are going to do this study, and here's where we are in

    14    the study and so on.  And we'll work with the protocol

    15    and so on.  So, yes.  I think both those points are


    16    well taken.

    17                Anything else on the implementation of

    18    past recommendations?

    19                (No response.)


    20                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Okay.  Moving ahead

    21    to the hazard exposure assessment, including the

    22    chemical and biological weapons.  Well, we have talked


    23    about that as an important issue that came up

    24    yesterday.  And clearly, it's one that we are going to

    25    have to look into.


                                                                        105

     1                We have on staff, or pending to be on


     2    staff very shortly, someone who has military

     3    background in the area of chemical and biological

     4    weapons who will have the clearance necessary to dig

     5    into the records and review all of that.


     6                There have been previous studies.  Our

     7    first thing is to review those, find out the validity

     8    of those, see if there are areas that we feel that


     9    haven't been looked into that need to be looked into

    10    further.

    11                And we have to be careful that we don't

    12    start from scratch on all of these, and that we look


    13    first at what's been done, and then try to analyze

    14    those and see whether more needs to be done.

    15                Yes?


    16                DR. RIOS:  On that, I noticed yesterday

    17    when we asked them about bombing patterns and what

    18    approach the military used on how to decide where to

    19    drop their bombs and where not to drop them,


    20    apparently a lot of that information is still

    21    classified.

    22                Whoever we bring in would have to be


    23    somebody that knows everything about military planning

    24    and what the ramifications are -- dropping bombs in

    25    certain areas.  I would assume that -- is that -- do


                                                                        106

     1    you have somebody in mind already?


     2                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Yes.

     3                DR. RIOS:  In mind already?

     4                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Yes.  And he does

     5    have that kind of background.  We'll get the CV's for


     6    all these people.  I haven't wanted to put out the

     7    CV's until they were processed and aboard.  But we'll

     8    get them as soon as they have been cleared and we'll


     9    be on to all of you.

    10                And keep in mind that what we aren't able

    11    to -- the expertise that we are not able to obtain as

    12    full-time staff here we can bring on as consultants on


    13    a part-time basis.

    14                So as we proceed through our process and

    15    we put staff on -- and you'll get the detailed CV's --


    16    and then if you feel that there are areas that there

    17    are gaps -- and we can identify consultants to bring

    18    in to do those.  But we have looked at someone that we

    19    think will fit the bill for -- in that area.


    20                DR. KNOX:  Do you mind if I --

    21                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Certainly.  By all

    22    means.


    23                DR. KNOX:  I think we need to look at a

    24    point that someone made yesterday.  And that is about

    25    the chemical and biological warfare that cannot be


                                                                        107

     1    accounted for, that Saddam had.  So I think that's


     2    something that we need to look at.

     3                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  John?

     4                DR. BALDESCHWIELER:  A useful field trip

     5    might be to Aberdeen, Edgewood, to have a look at the


     6    various sensors and detection systems.  I think that

     7    would -- for those who haven't seen that, that would

     8    be a potentially useful trip for the Committee.


     9                And one other aspect in this category. 

    10    There have been, I think, so many concerns raised

    11    about the prophylactic drugs, about the pyridostigmine

    12    bromide and the vaccines that it would be useful to


    13    have a thorough review of what's known from the

    14    standpoint of the original FDA files on these

    15    documents.


    16                And also from the standpoint of the

    17    anthrax vaccine, the British troops of course I think

    18    were all vaccinated.  And I don't know if the source

    19    of the vaccine was the same.  I suspect it was not.


    20                But -- that is that the U.S. troops

    21    received vaccine from the Michigan state origin.  And

    22    some from the British origin as well.  But I think a


    23    comparison in that regard would be extremely

    24    illuminating.

    25                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  I think that maybe


                                                                        108

     1    another area where we would have a panel present to


     2    the full Committee -- I mean, we would get staff to

     3    get background information, but this is something that

     4    deserves a panel presentation.

     5                And a little further down the line after


     6    we get all this on the table, we will sort of go back

     7    and try to figure out what panels we want at the next

     8    meeting and the following meeting, and some kind of


     9    time line on that.

    10                DR. BALDESCHWIELER:  Are the -- the

    11    botulinum toxin has not been mentioned.

    12                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Yes.


    13                DR. BALDESCHWIELER:  But that one was also

    14    distributed to a limited number.  I think -- of the

    15    order of 8,000 U.S. troops received that.  And it


    16    seems to me that that would be an important part of

    17    that review as well.

    18                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Yes.  Okay.  Fine.

    19                Other thoughts on this one?


    20                Elaine?

    21                DR. LARSON:  Yes.  I was going to concur

    22    that the most efficient way for us to deal with this


    23    factual information about vaccines and these chemicals

    24    is with expert panels.

    25                But when I am looking at charge number 7,


                                                                        109

     1    I guess I do need a little clarification on what we


     2    are supposed to be doing.  It just says regarding

     3    chemical and biological weapons, we are to:

     4                 ""review information related to

     5          reports of possible detection of chemical


     6          or biological weapons during the Persian

     7          Gulf Conflict.""

     8                Well, what are we supposed to do with it? 


     9    And hasn't that been done?  I am not exactly clear

    10    what we are supposed to do with that information.

    11                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  I think what we are

    12    supposed to do is look at the previous studies about


    13    that and the response and why they've been passed off,

    14    and see whether we think there is any stone unturned

    15    or whether we are satisfied that it has been


    16    adequately addressed.

    17                DR. TAYLOR:  Because we did hear yesterday

    18    that there was no chemical warfare used.  Right?

    19                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Right.


    20                DR. TAYLOR:  So --

    21                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  I guess we can read

    22    the newspapers and see when the defector from Iraq is


    23    going to testify before the U.N. on their chemical and

    24    biological warfare.  We may get some information. 

    25    He's going to testify soon.  So stay tuned.


                                                                        110

     1                David?


     2                DR. HAMBURG:  I think there is a general

     3    principle there.  I think you are absolutely right,

     4    Joyce, that we need to start with the existing

     5    reports, the serious ones that are science based to


     6    the extent possible.

     7                But then we also need to look for updates. 

     8    In the case we were just talking about now, there are


     9    some conceivable updated.  One was raised yesterday

    10    about this U.N. technical group, I guess the group

    11    that's headed by Rolf Ichaeus.  They've been in and

    12    out of Iraq quite a bit since the prior reports were


    13    published.

    14                And it may be that there is something of

    15    importance there.  I think you are absolutely right


    16    about these recent defectors -- may well be a source

    17    of information.

    18                In any case, the principle is in each --

    19    in each case, we build on what's there, but we ask


    20    about updates.  Is there new information?  Or are

    21    there approaches that have never been taken that are

    22    feasible to take?  It should be built upon the


    23    previous reports.

    24                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Okay.

    25                Don?


                                                                        111

     1                DR. CUSTIS:  I think we ought to find out


     2    if the American Legion has a source of information

     3    that is not generally known.

     4                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Pardon?  Could you --

     5                DR. CUSTIS:  I think we ought to find out


     6    whether the American Legion has a source of

     7    information that is not generally known.  They make

     8    some pretty categorical statements.


     9                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Well, all the

    10    testimony we heard yesterday, you know, much of it was

    11    abbreviated.  We will have full records from all the

    12    people who testified, and we can have staff follow up


    13    and get additional information on any points that were

    14    raised that we feel are not adequately covered.

    15                And it will be quite a research task.  All


    16    right.  Moving on then to the bioethics and humans and

    17    subjects protection area.

    18                Why don't we let you, Art, kick that one

    19    off for us -- and what you think we need to do and


    20    look at in that area.

    21                DR. CAPLAN:  I think there's really two

    22    divisions there to look at that occurred to me as I


    23    was listening to the testimony.  One is sort of the

    24    research ethics question:  What can we do to protect

    25    those who are asked to take experimental or innovative


                                                                        112

     1    things?


     2                The drugs, the vaccines, that whole issue

     3    should be looked at in terms of what they were told,

     4    risks that they were going to face, what's practical,

     5    what's silly in the context of active or imminent


     6    conflict.

     7                I think there's some questions about how

     8    we are doing now in terms of protecting subjects as we


     9    try to understand what happened.

    10                And that's what I was asking of the last

    11    panel in terms of identified information, loss of

    12    insurance, the information going back to employers,


    13    other third parties, that sort of thing.

    14                So there are a set of issues about the, if

    15    you will, research or innovative things that might


    16    have been done to troops -- or during or just before

    17    the conflict.

    18                And then as we try to assess what they are

    19    exposed to and what the ability is of these studies to


    20    figure out what happened, how well do we do in making

    21    sure that their welfare is protected?

    22                And then there's the ethical issues on the


    23    clinical side.  How well does the system deal with

    24    them?  Are they informed?  Do they get humane and

    25    respectful treatment when they go into the VA or not? 


                                                                        113

     1    Do they get dealt with well within the context of the


     2    military health system with their complaints?  Are

     3    they basically getting the kind of care that we think

     4    is ethically acceptable?

     5                So that's roughly the visions I would be


     6    looking at there.  I think there's a bigger issue that

     7    I flagged before that I just want to come back to

     8    again.  It seems to me the best ethics is still


     9    prophylactic.

    10                So anything we can say about how not to

    11    get these problems, again, is going to be very useful

    12    in terms of what I think would be constructive for


    13    Americans to hear about.  How to minimize these

    14    problems from coming up again.

    15                And I'll tell  you what I mean by that. 


    16    I did go -- and I remember being at a hearing on the

    17    vaccines.  There's a lot of claims that we didn't have

    18    basic science and didn't know about animal safety with

    19    these things and that you did the best you could.


    20                You tried to use these antibiological

    21    warfare weapons, antichemical warfare interventions,

    22    just assuming that it would be better to be protected


    23    than not.

    24                I'm not sure today that we are any better

    25    off in answering the question:  Would we use them next


                                                                        114

     1    week?  And that's not a situation we should be in.  We


     2    just had a big experiment in the field.

     3                And I don't know whether we could answer

     4    any more -- that if next week we had to go and deploy

     5    in a desert situation and somebody said, ""I think


     6    there might biological or chemical weapons put into

     7    place.  So should I take this vaccine or do I take

     8    this pill?"" -- something is not good about that.


     9                That seems to me to be an ethical problem. 

    10    If we sort of miss the opportunity to figure out the

    11    answer to the question, we are going to be back at it

    12    again a month or a year or ten years from now.  So --


    13                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Any thoughts about

    14    how we would go about both aspects of that?  First,

    15    what they were told, the initial ones.  And then the


    16    more difficult one, I think --

    17                DR. CAPLAN:  Some of it's panels again. 

    18    I think there's some opportunity there for information

    19    to be presented to us about what the actual context is


    20    of doing -- in wartime situations or in conflict,

    21    trying out new medicines, new vaccines, what's policy,

    22    getting the documents and then finding out literally


    23    from a few people what they think the -- what's

    24    reasonable to try and do and what's not reasonable to

    25    try and do.


                                                                        115

     1                Postwise, I think some of the testimony


     2    we'll collect in terms of care, clinical care and

     3    outreach, will cover what we need.  I don't think

     4    we'll need anything special.  We'll just have to ask

     5    the right questions in there.


     6                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Well, again, in terms

     7    -- in following up with Don's idea that maybe the idea

     8    of some focus groups that could --


     9                DR. CAPLAN:  Yes.  It would help.

    10                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Work on all these.

    11                DR. CAPLAN:  Yes.

    12                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Get some good focus


    13    groups that are representative and not necessarily

    14    just the people who come forward, who, you know --

    15                DR. CAPLAN:  I think that's a very good


    16    idea.

    17                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Particularly going to

    18    be the people who have problems, clearly.

    19                DR. CAPLAN:  Yes.


    20                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  I mean, that's

    21    expected.  But if we want a broader, to have focus

    22    groups that we could explore a number of these issues


    23    with.

    24                DR. CAPLAN:  I think that's a great idea.

    25                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Okay.


                                                                        116

     1                Phil?


     2                DR. LANDRIGAN:  Although I think these

     3    issues of the vaccine and the antidotes -- they are

     4    basically research questions.  And what we need to do

     5    is look at the state of the data and the data gaps. 


     6    Where has the testing been adequate?  Where is it

     7    deficient?

     8                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Yes.


     9                DR. LANDRIGAN:  What do we need to know?

    10                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  On that aspect, I

    11    think there's no question we could get it.  I was

    12    thinking in terms of what people were told, how the


    13    felt about it and so on.

    14                Elaine?

    15                DR. LARSON:  Well, actually the


    16    interesting about the issues that Arthur raises is

    17    that they are not research questions.  They are

    18    ethical questions.  They are questions of values.  And

    19    they are questions of sort of sociologic perspective. 


    20    And that's beyond our charge.

    21                Although I do think that within the

    22    context of our, you know, number 3 charge, if you


    23    will, we don't have, unless I am missing it, a charge

    24    to deal with the bioethics of and so forth.  But I

    25    think it does go in number 3.


                                                                        117

     1                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  I think it goes in


     2    number 3.  And clearly we are expected to, or Art

     3    wouldn't be on this panel.  So I think his presence

     4    here tells us that we ought to be looking at those

     5    kinds of issues.


     6                DR. BALDESCHWIELER:  Well, a major issue

     7    of how you behave under a strategic situation of great

     8    uncertainty is the quality of the intelligence


     9    information that is available.  That is, if one knew

    10    for sure what the opposition had and their doctrine

    11    for using it, you would behave, of course, very

    12    differently.


    13                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  That may or may not

    14    be part of the classified material that may or may not

    15    get unclassified in time for us to discuss it


    16    publicly.  But all of us I suspect at some point will

    17    have our clearance confirmed.  And we will be able to

    18    look at those things in closed session, anything that

    19    we can't have open.


    20                Anything else on that score?

    21                (No response.)

    22                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  I think the


    23    pyridostigmine bromide issue --

    24                DR. CAPLAN:  Joyce, one other comment

    25    which I am not sure about how to respond to -- and it


                                                                        118

     1    goes into this problem we got into earlier about


     2    trying to comment on the VA or the CHAMPUS program

     3    generally, and keeping our focus on the veterans and

     4    the Gulf War issue.

     5                But clearly some of the problems that come


     6    up -- and we were joking about this yesterday -- but

     7    it's not a joke from the point of view of access to

     8    services.


     9                Are problems in the system -- I mean the

    10    American healthcare system, not problems -- anybody

    11    would have problems who has a preexisting condition or

    12    a child with a disability.


    13                There are just some problems in the

    14    system.  An we are not going to review and fix all

    15    that.  But it seems to me, we may simply have to -- it


    16    may be necessary for us to say something about some of

    17    the equity or access problems that people face.

    18                They are not due to, necessarily, Gulf War

    19    experience.  They are due to problems that are still


    20    unsolved in healthcare.  So I don't propose that we

    21    review the system again.  I think that was last year's

    22    project.  But we --


    23                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  We didn't solve it

    24    last year.

    25                DR. CAPLAN:  We didn't solve it.


                                                                        119

     1                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  So it --


     2                DR. CAPLAN:  I think it's been raised

     3    again at this year's Congress.  But --

     4                DR. CUSTIS:  If we did solve it, the

     5    solution would have been simple.


     6                DR. CAPLAN:  Right.  But we may need to

     7    flag that as -- that some of the things we've  heard

     8    even yesterday in testimony were problems of the


     9    system.  They are not VA problems.  They are problems.

    10                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  I think that's valid. 

    11    And I don't see how we can avoid without, as you say,

    12    reviewing all the healthcare system inequities, but we


    13    need to take cognizance of it.

    14                Other thoughts about all this before we

    15    now dig into in -- and it's so good we are going to do


    16    all of this.  Just how are we going to do it?

    17                (No response.)

    18                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  As I said, we will be

    19    staffing up in each of these areas and have


    20    consultants available to us as well.  And then the use

    21    of scientific panels.  So I'd like to move at this

    22    point into the strategies for doing this.  And that


    23    means a number of meetings, kinds of panels, what are

    24    the issues, which ones, the priority for doing them.

    25                The question of subcommittee formats,


                                                                        120

     1    whether we break up into some subcommittees.  And


     2    especially if we want to do numerous hearings around

     3    the country it may not be practical for all of us to

     4    attend every hearing.

     5                But it may be that we could develop some


     6    subcommittees and hold hearings in different parts

     7    without the full Committee.

     8                Why don't we start with that issue as a


     9    whole?  Are -- should all of our meetings be full

    10    Committee?  We are a relatively small Committee. 

    11    There are 12 of us.  Ten of us were able to make

    12    today's.


    13                We thought we would have had 11, but

    14    something came up at the last minute that -- for

    15    General Franks.  We will continue to -- and this one


    16    was called in very short order after your appointment

    17    and did interrupt people's vacations.

    18                We'll have enough time to hopefully get on

    19    everybody's schedules.  But everybody has busy


    20    schedules.  So what are your feelings about number of

    21    meetings, subcommittees, small --

    22                Andrea?


    23                DR. TAYLOR:  Sometimes I think it's going

    24    to be important that we work in subgroups to discuss

    25    these issues further and come up with -- and possibly


                                                                        121

     1    come up with a scheme.


     2                It might -- you know, for those of us who

     3    are interested in exposure assessment, for instance,

     4    I think maybe working in a small group to develop a

     5    plan and present it to the full body or something of


     6    that sort would be good.

     7                The same with some of the other areas,

     8    healthcare, primary care.  Using it as a subcommittee


     9    and then bringing back a full report to the entire

    10    body to accept or adopt may be useful.

    11                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Elaine?

    12                DR. LARSON:  Along those lines I was going


    13    to make a similar suggestion.  And that is that we

    14    have some subcommittees with specific assignments as

    15    much as possible related to the seven charges that we


    16    have.

    17                But also that each of our subcommittees

    18    has assigned staff so that we are working in

    19    subcommittee with staff who are collecting data and


    20    then the group is assigned to collate the data or do

    21    whatever with it.

    22                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Yes.


    23                DR. LARSON:  We actually -- I was sort of

    24    taking notes as we were talking about ideas and

    25    processes.  And we actually had laid out some plans


                                                                        122

     1    that I think we could move from there on.  One is for


     2    charges 2, 3, and 4, we talked about case studies,

     3    field visits, and focus groups.

     4                Now, for those we may or may not want full

     5    committee.  There may be some where we'll have a field


     6    visit that we'll do, you know, something in a region

     7    or whatever.  For charges 1 and 5 through 7, first

     8    before we can do anything else, we need staff work.


     9                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Right.

    10                DR. LARSON:  And so we have got to get all

    11    of that done.  And I liked your previous idea about

    12    starting with number 5, the external reviews, and see


    13    where we are with that.  And sort of look at where the

    14    recommendations are in process.  That might be a next

    15    full Committee meeting that we need to do.


    16                And then for charges 6 and 7 which have to

    17    do with risk factors and chemical and biological

    18    weapons, there you suggested that we need some expert

    19    testimony, which again is full committee work, I


    20    think.

    21                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  I think that's an

    22    excellent summary.  I agree with that.


    23                Anyone else want to add to Elaine's --

    24                John?

    25                DR. BALDESCHWIELER:  Let me express a


                                                                        123

     1    concern about credibility.  That is to say if we


     2    divide the work to -- in too many fine segments, then

     3    I guess I am concerned about our individual

     4    credibility in those areas where we have a lot of

     5    expertise.


     6                It seems to me that the issue of

     7    credibility would be a highlighted.  An important

     8    aspect of this Committee is that the Committee as a


     9    whole, I think, brings credibility to these issues.

    10                That is, if your resident chemist is the

    11    only one who speaks to the chemical warfare issues, it

    12    seems to me that's somewhat precarious.


    13                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  But I would think --

    14    let me react first before I ask everyone else to

    15    react.  My interpretation -- and, Elaine, correct me


    16    if I am wrong -- would be that the subcommittee would

    17    work through with staff on that and present something

    18    to the full committee.

    19                DR. LARSON:  That's right.


    20                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  But as resident

    21    chemist, you would have to convince all of us first

    22    before we would accept it.  Not just we'll just take


    23    it.

    24                DR. BALDESCHWIELER:  A Committee consensus

    25    it seems to me is a critical part of our output.


                                                                        124

     1                DR. TAYLOR:  And that would be my first


     2    comment -- is that if we worked subgroups, which I

     3    think is a good idea because of all the material that

     4    we have, we would bring it back to the full Committee

     5    for any kind of acceptance or otherwise rejection of


     6    what the recommendations are.  That kind of thing.

     7                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Elaine?

     8                DR. LARSON:  Another point is that while


     9    I think at least one Committee member should be

    10    present at each focus group or case study

    11    presentation, just in terms of cost benefit and

    12    efficiency and getting more information, we could


    13    convene some of these focus groups or case studies,

    14    however we decide to do it, in various parts of the

    15    country, making it possible for subgroups of us to get


    16    together with people who might have more difficulty

    17    traveling -- some people who might not be able to come

    18    here for a variety of reasons that would like to be

    19    heard and need to be heard.


    20                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Yes?

    21                DR. RIOS:  I was going to ask John a

    22    question.  Is your concern that if you have a


    23    subcommittee and the chairperson is a chemist, say,

    24    and that person makes a recommendation -- you are

    25    concerned that there is no objectivity insofar as the


                                                                        125

     1    full Committee being able to hear the information


     2    that's presented to the subcommittee?

     3                I mean, I understand where you are coming

     4    from because I think credibility is very important. 

     5    Are you saying that it's important that we hear all


     6    the evidence?

     7                Or maybe it could be taken care of by

     8    having the subcommittee chair not make


     9    recommendations, and just say here is what I heard,

    10    and summarize the information?  I am trying to get at

    11    what you were concerned about.

    12                DR. BALDESCHWIELER:  I think credibility


    13    is the central issue of this exercise, and that

    14    operating as individual experts in our own fields, I

    15    think that credibility is likely to be questioned.


    16                I would say in epidemiology, for example,

    17    the same kind of concern.  So that I think enough of

    18    us have to hear enough of the story from all of its

    19    aspects to, you know -- to give a credible consensus


    20    view.

    21                DR. RIOS:  So you are arguing against a

    22    subcommittee type of format?


    23                DR. BALDESCHWIELER:  Or at least a

    24    division into subcommittees so small.

    25                DR. TAYLOR:  I'm not thinking of just one


                                                                        126

     1    person per subcommittee though.  I am thinking a


     2    little more -- there are what -- 11 of us -- maybe

     3    three in each group and don't have more than three

     4    focus groups at a time before we decide to tackle

     5    something else, three or four.


     6                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Phil?

     7                DR. LANDRIGAN:  There may be a useful

     8    model here in the way that the National Institutes of


     9    Health review grant applications.  A grant application

    10    comes in and it's assigned to a study session usually

    11    consisting of ten or a dozen people, as many as we

    12    have on this committee.


    13                And the ultimate verdict on the grant is

    14    rendered by the whole study session who vote and

    15    assign ratings.  But within the study session, usually


    16    two people, sometimes three, are assigned primary

    17    responsibility on the basis of their expertise for

    18    reviewing the grant and informing the rest of the

    19    committee about the grant.


    20                And then there is a discussion.  And the

    21    committee may entirely accept the recommendation of

    22    the primary reviewers or further aspects may emerge. 


    23    And maybe that's the way to, on the one hand maximize

    24    efficiency, because none of us is doing this as a

    25    full-time job.


                                                                        127

     1                It's all -- for all of us it's in addition


     2    to something else.  And it seems to me cumbersome to

     3    think that every one of us can attend in full detail

     4    to every aspect of this.

     5                And yet, at the same time, it's a way to


     6    protect the credibility of the one or two people with

     7    particular expertise that take primary responsibility

     8    for reviewing a particular aspect.


     9                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Is that, do you

    10    think, responsive, John?

    11                DR. KNOX:  Well, and I think too, if you

    12    are interested in a certain area, you certainly should


    13    not be restricted from not seeing what that

    14    subcommittee does.

    15                If you would like to, you know, be


    16    involved in more than one subcommittee, or just sit on

    17    one and see what all the information received is, I

    18    think you should be welcome to do that.

    19                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  David?


    20                DR. HAMBURG:  I think that the

    21    subcommittee structure should really follow the task

    22    requirements that we encounter.  I don't see any need


    23    to -- in fact, it would be very undesirable to say

    24    well, we are going to essentially, arbitrarily have so

    25    and so many subcommittees or do everything in the


                                                                        128

     1    first instance by subcommittee.


     2                On the other hand, it seems to me almost

     3    inevitable that the time we have available and the

     4    complexity of the task will call for some kind of

     5    efficient working arrangements.


     6                And subcommittees would be a part of that,

     7    including, by the way, conference calls, not

     8    necessarily their meeting all the time.  But small


     9    subcommittees could move the agenda ahead without

    10    having, so to say, voting rights to settle the issue.

    11                Now, on credibility, John, I think you are

    12    right and wrong.  The credibility thing cuts both


    13    ways.  To have a chemist of your stature gives us

    14    credibility that we are not, you know, wandering in

    15    the dark with respect to chemical issues.


    16                On the other hand, those of a suspicious

    17    turn of mind may assume that having somebody who has

    18    lived his life in the chemical community gives him a

    19    warp, a serious warp, a deficiency -- he knows too


    20    much.

    21                It cuts both ways, depending in some part

    22    on who the audience is.  And I think we need both.  We


    23    need your expertise in chemistry or Phil's in

    24    epidemiology.  We desperately need that.  We also need

    25    to put some people at certain times around you so that


                                                                        129

     1    there are multiple perspectives on your expertise. 


     2    And we can do that.

     3                DR. BALDESCHWIELER:  I think you have said

     4    it very, very well.  Were right on target.

     5                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Okay.  In that light,


     6    do we need to identify any of the subcommittees at

     7    this point?  Or do we leave that for staff and myself

     8    to be in contact as we try to work through the


     9    project?

    10                DR. HAMBURG:  I think you and staff

    11    should, in the next week or two, intensively think

    12    about this.


    13                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  We'll be on the phone

    14    constantly.  But I would -- it's obvious that John and

    15    Andrea -- and, Phil, I am afraid we'll have you on so


    16    many subcommittees, Phil.

    17                We'll be looking at some of the

    18    environmental risks and the biological and chemical,

    19    as well as wanting you on the epidemiological.  But


    20    that's a natural grouping.

    21                And medical care is a natural grouping

    22    with Elaine and Marguerite and Art and Don.  You know,


    23    there is some natural -- I'll float around.  But as

    24    you say, we'll work on this as we try to -- but what

    25    about the oral briefings for the Committee.


                                                                        130

     1                Well, maybe -- what things could be


     2    handled in focus groups with then a report from the

     3    focus groups to the full Committee.  This being focus

     4    groups of consumers or veterans really versus what

     5    things you would like to see done on expert panels


     6    brought forward.

     7                They are quite different.  I shouldn't put

     8    those one against the other.  We really identified


     9    some areas that lend themselves to focus groups and

    10    then some that lend themselves to expert panels.

    11                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  David?

    12                DR. HAMBURG:  Yesterday it seemed to be


    13    that we heard expressions of anguish in two themes,

    14    both of which might be suitable for focus groups to

    15    clarify.  One had to do with the themes of conversion


    16    -- coercion -- sorry.

    17                Coercion, involuntary participation as in

    18    immunization or prophylactic medication.  Begin forced

    19    to do something without much information and without


    20    a choice to opt out and so on.  And to understand

    21    those kinds of issues it is conceivable that a focus

    22    group would convene.


    23                We also heard the theme of neglect.  Long

    24    waits for VA care.  Slow processing of disability

    25    applications.  Denial of benefits and so on.  I think


                                                                        131

     1    the themes of coercion and neglect came up over and


     2    over again.  And those are kinds of issues that

     3    professional focus groups, well designed focus groups,

     4    have been able to clarify in other settings.

     5                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Okay.  I think those


     6    are --

     7                Yes?  Elaine?

     8                DR. LARSON:  I think we can proceed


     9    simultaneously with two things.  First of all we can

    10    set up for our next meeting, which I assume will be in

    11    the fall.  Some expert testimony related to the

    12    specific of chemical and biologic and environmental


    13    potential hazards, etc.

    14                We can set those up, and staff can work

    15    with the panel and with others to find out the best


    16    way to get the information on that.  We can also

    17    decide how we want to proceed with these focus groups. 

    18    The focus groups can't be done in full Committee.

    19                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  No.


    20                DR. LARSON:  The results need to be

    21    presented to full Committee.

    22                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Right.


    23                DR. LARSON:  So they need to start now as

    24    well and be on -- be in process.  They probably won't

    25    be ready for sort of synthesis and presentation at the


                                                                        132

     1    next meeting in the fall.  But in order to have them


     2    ready for the one after that, we are going to have to

     3    start them now.

     4                And so those two things can go on while at

     5    the same time, either before or after lunch, we should


     6    have some more discussion about whether we or

     7    subgroups want to do, in addition to the focus groups,

     8    which we don't have to do, except attend.


     9                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Yes.

    10                DR. LARSON:  Do we want to do something

    11    else in the way of case study panels or in the way of

    12    field -- we threw these words around, and we need some


    13    more discussion on what we want to do with that.  So

    14    I think three things going on simultaneously are going

    15    to have to occur to get us done in time.


    16                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Well, you know, I --

    17                Robyn?  Please?

    18                DR. NISHIMI:  I just wanted to say one

    19    thing about the focus groups so not to raise your


    20    expectation that you would even get this by the second

    21    meeting, because obviously this will require a fair

    22    amount of planning as to what we want.


    23                And then we will have to select the right

    24    contractor who will then have to get the proper

    25    groups.  So I just, you know -- I don't want to --


                                                                        133

     1                DR. LARSON:  No.  I agree.  Even more


     2    reason why we start now thinking about when we want to

     3    do that so that we'll have these things lined up and

     4    can get the work done.

     5                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Yes.  Well, actually


     6    I was going to say if there -- we talk about general

     7    principles about this.  Then we try to say what should

     8    the priorities -- so if we can identify what things we


     9    will want to have panels here for the full Committee.

    10                What things we have just done on the

    11    focus.  What we want to do in field hearings where we

    12    will hear from veterans in different areas -- separate


    13    from the focus groups because I think the focus group

    14    is a different kind of structure than the kind of open

    15    hearing where anyone, you know, wants to present their


    16    position.

    17                Do we decide in principle how we feel

    18    about those things?  Then I think we would try to set

    19    up a time line of which are the first ones to do,


    20    considering that we have a six-month report due and

    21    then a final report that is a year and a half from

    22    now.


    23                And the six-month report -- I am saying --

    24    we'll fudge a little on six months, the end of

    25    February, first of March.


                                                                        134

     1                No?


     2                DR. NISHIMI:  No.  There's no fudging on

     3    that date.

     4                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  There's no fudging on

     5    that date.


     6                DR. NISHIMI:  No.  No.

     7                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Mid-February?

     8                DR. NISHIMI:  February 14th and 15th would


     9    be six months.

    10                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Okay.  We have our

    11    marching orders.  February 14th and 15th we have to

    12    have an interim report ready.


    13                DR. CAPLAN:  Joyce?

    14                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Yes.

    15                DR. CAPLAN:  One thing I would like to


    16    suggest is that the next meeting be devoted to the

    17    compilation of the recommendations about what

    18    information to acquire and some initial step by us to

    19    assess that.


    20                Because if we are going to say something

    21    by February 14th, we want to leave ourselves time to

    22    both find out what these recommendations are and then


    23    ask about them again if we need to, since that is

    24    going to become a crucial part, I suspect, of the

    25    interim report.


                                                                        135

     1                How well are we doing, given the task


     2    that's been put out there to four groups and

     3    subsidiary studies to get information?  How well is

     4    that happening?

     5                I think it would be appropriate -- I don't


     6    think there is any shift that is going to take place

     7    on the biological and chemical warfare area, in terms

     8    of what's known, to schedule some expert testimony


     9    about that.

    10                That simply exists.  And the same thing is

    11    true about the vaccines and the various prophylactic

    12    things that were tried out.  We could certainly look


    13    to schedule those.

    14                It does seem to me we should start to

    15    think about the adequacy of care and having some


    16    hearings or the ability to collect information out in

    17    the field in different locations.  I'm not ready yet 

    18    to say exactly what questions we need to ask.

    19                But we certainly need to standardize them. 


    20    We have been yelling at everybody else to get

    21    standardized questions.  And if we are going to go out

    22    in the field, we have to come with standardized


    23    questions to ask to make sure that we can do that.

    24                And that's going to be a staff

    25    responsibility.  And it's going to take a little time


                                                                        136

     1    logistically to set those up.  So it does seem to me


     2    that for the next meeting, which I gather you are

     3    talking October --

     4                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  We are talking about

     5    mid-October or around --


     6                DR. CAPLAN:  So that's pretty fast.  We

     7    might look for the recommendations, try to compile

     8    that, see how people are meeting the goals that have


     9    been set in terms of getting information, and maybe

    10    some of these panel presentations about the areas that

    11    at least look like to me they are -- I don't want to

    12    say they are settled -- but they are -- the expertise


    13    is there.

    14                What's known is known.  It's not going to

    15    change unless we get one of our surprise defector


    16    announcements about biological warfare.  But short of

    17    that, that may be a place to go in the short run.

    18                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Well --

    19                DR. CAPLAN:  I'm concerned when we get


    20    going on the recommendations that --

    21                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  I agree.  I mean, one

    22    way to look at our priority of deciding what we want


    23    at which level is what do we want to try cover in that

    24    first interim report?

    25                DR. CAPLAN:  Yes.


                                                                        137

     1                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  And one way is to


     2    look at as -- well, some things that are easy to

     3    handle we can get out of the way, like chemical and

     4    biological, the other is to say well, you know, that's

     5    not that burning and immediate an issue.  We can


     6    handle that later.

     7                I think we have to balance which way to

     8    go.  I think, clearly, looking at the recommendations


     9    that have been made, because there is no point looking

    10    at those a year and a half from now.

    11                DR. CAPLAN:  Right.

    12                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  We ought to look at


    13    those now and focus our interim report around what are

    14    the recommendations that have been made, and where do

    15    we stand on those?


    16                And maybe if we all agree on that, then

    17    trying to determine just what are the panels is not

    18    necessarily a good idea at this meeting.  We may need

    19    some staff work over the next month or so.


    20                I don't know, Robyn.

    21                DR. NISHIMI:  I'm sorry.  I --

    22                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  I -- yes.  You got


    23    distracted too.

    24                Well, let's sit on this and mull it at

    25    lunch.  And -- because I think it's noon.  And I don't


                                                                        138

     1    know how all of you are feeling, but we've had a


     2    pretty intensive morning.

     3                Maybe this is a good point to take our

     4    lunch break, think about some of this over noon.  And

     5    we'll com back after lunch and try to go through a


     6    time line, priorities for hearings, staff hearings,

     7    and so on.

     8                (Whereupon, the proceedings went off the

     3                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  I believe we're ready

     4    to resume.  Dr. Landrigan had to leave to catch a

     5    plane.  And some of the other Committee members may


     6    need to leave before our official adjournment at 3:00.

     7                But I would appreciate it if the others

     8    could hang in here with us until we complete our


     9    business.  I think we made a lot of progress this

    10    morning in going through the charter, what we hope to

    11    accomplish and some of the methodologies we'll use.

    12                I think at the break we were up to the


    13    point of maybe exploring a little further what are the

    14    areas we would like to have full briefings on for the

    15    full Committee with scientific panels, not necessarily


    16    the time order for them, but just what are the subject

    17    areas.

    18                And I'd like to go back to that question

    19    of subcommittees and get a feeling from each of the


    20    members of the areas they would like to be most

    21    involved in.

    22                Then I think we ought to be at the point


    23    where we might try to set some priorities and talk

    24    about the frequency of meetings, and at least come to

    25    an agreement on the next two or three meetings, not


                                                                        140

     1    the specific dates, but roughly the timing and the


     2    subject matter for those meetings.  And then we can go

     3    from there.

     4                So with that in mind, let me just open it

     5    up again for discussion of subjects for full panels


     6    for the full Committee.  We did identify clinical care

     7    as one.  We identified biologic, meaning the

     8    immunizations and -- remind me.


     9                Chemical and biological.  Oh, biological

    10    I already had.  And chemical war.  Oh, the infectious

    11    diseases.  We wanted to get some good scientific

    12    panelists that would deal with the mycoplasma with the


    13    microsporidia issue and with Q fever, leishmaniasis,

    14    and any of the other tropical diseases that possibly

    15    be clinica

raza1@gmail.com,science7.txt," was published in the Hanover Proceedings in more detail
than the English abstract, Dr. Hans Nieper mentioned the Berlin engineer
Levetzow, who was one of the first to postulate a combination pressure and
shielding theory for the phenomena of gravity.  Levetzow was soon
overshadowed by the rising star of Albert Einstein, but one of his
followers, Horst Pinkell, went to Russia in 1928 as an exchange student -
and never returned.  Together with Russian scientists, he was asked to
prove the actual existence of the cosmic radiations postulated by Levetzow,
now designated as neutrino sea or ""tachion field"".  The work was done in
Sterlitamak, south of the Ural mountains, and in 1938, sporadic reports
reached the West about the discovery of extremely short corpuscler waves by
Pinkell and Gorjew.  These were the long sought ""Hemmstrahlen"" or drag
waves associated gravity.  Rumors have it that a metal alloy was soon
developed which acted as a drag wave polarisor and, in 1947, agents
reported experimental Russian aircraft using this discovery.  In 1951, a
former German Junkers aircraft engineer reported about his activity
pertaining to a super-secret project code named COW-7 in Siberia, a disk-
shaped craft which could rise vertically and which belonged to the secret
weapons then developed by the Soviets.  Whether it was related to the
Canadian AVRO project or something entirely different remained unknown,
only the Levetzow gravity theory was assumed in connection with the
activity in question.

JAPAN:  My esteemed friend, Prof. Seike, who kept me informed about the
research conducted by him and his co-workers, surprised me once with a
significant statement, which I feel is important to repeat for the benefit
of frustrated researcher's on this side of the Pacific: ""In the early stage
of my studies, physicists could not understand what I was doing, while
actors and actresses did so by intuition"".  it was the private support of
about 800 individual artists, etc., in Japan which allowed the support of
the Japanese equivalent of a National Science Foundation or a similar
bureaucratic institution in that country.  Again and again, I was surprised
how quickly and eagerly American experiments, as for instance the almost
forgotten ""Ionocraft"" of the late Major De Seversky, were duplicated and
explored even in Japanese secondary schools.  Admiral Rickover has more
than once complained about our intellectual complacency: ""As a nation, we
seem addicted to 'spectatoritis'.  We sit in the bleachers and let the game
of life unfold before us"".

The results are known:  The Japanese have achieved top positions in science
and technology, and not only with tachion beams melting stones, producing
""biased"" water with a freezing point of minus 4 degrees Celsius, and a G-
power generator obtaining 400 VDC output from a 10 V input driving source.
I wish to take this opportunity to thank Prof. Seike for sharing his work
with us in this country, and wish him the best of success for the future.

FRANCE:  The work of SEPED was explained by M. Rene Louis Valee and some
French publications in the area of gravity research have been translated by
the NASA translation services, as for instance the theory of the
electromagnetic Magnus Effect (of Marcel Pages).

Specific mention must be made of the Raymond Kromrey G-Field generator, a
French-Ferman-Swiss development which appears very closely related to the
American ""N"" machine principle, the ""Sunburst"" machine and the ""Permanent
Magnet-Motor"" Patent of Howard Johnson.  Utilizing either permanent or
electromagnetic modules, the generator output exceeds the input by far.
One prototype delivers approximately 700 watts at speeds varying between
600 and 1200 RPM.  Models with an output of 100 to 160 KW are presently in
the planning stage.  Several European patents have been granted against
heavy opposition, especially from French industrial circles.  The
development was about 40 years in the making and the inventor stresses the
need for a reinvestigation of electromagnetics and gravitic forces, as well
as a reexamination of many cemented dogmas in present day physics.

GERMANY:  A system of rotating electromagnets and magnetic ""stator rings""
of the German ""Kunel"" Generator complement the general trend of the
American and French generators mentioned before.  The first prototype was
reported to have been tested in April, 1980.  Here again, very heavy
opposition from the German orthodox science establishment.  Of special
interest is a comment by Nobel laureate Werner Heisenberg, reported to have
been made vis-a-vis the inventor:

     ""I think it is possible to utilize magnetism as an energy
     source.  But we science idiots cannot do that; this has to
     come from the outside"".

More details about French and German developments have been published in
the new book already mentioned, Energy in Abundance by Hilscher and,
hopefully, an English version of this important work will be available by
next year.  Generators which do interact with surrounding energy fields
have been designated as ""open systems"", in contrast to our present ""closed
system"" technology of gasoline and diesel engines, steam turbines, nuclear
power plants and so forth.  The theoretical basis for all ""open systems"" is
the realization that there simply is no such thing as ""empty space"".  In
reality, space is filled with an extremely energy rich, subatomic and
subquantic continuum.  In short, a pre-physical state of matter, which can
be tapped, as for instance by the spinning of magnetic systems which
extract momentum via a vortex-formation of the universal ""tachion field"".

AUSTRIA:  This small heartland of Central Europe is proud of her native
pioneers in science, among them Dr. Wilhelm Reich, Viktor Schauberger and
Karl Schappeller.  But after Dr. Reiche died in an American prison in 1957
and victor Schauberger died only five days after his return from the USA in
1958, where he received an incredibly unfair treatment from certain
industrialists, there is little enthusiasm among Austrians to touch base
with correspondents on this continent.  Viktor Schauberger's son, Walter,
refuses, as a matter of principle, to communicate with Americans, no matter
in what language.  To illustrate the type of ""contract"" Viktor Schauberger
was forced to sign, it stated:

     that all of his patents would become the property of the ""consortium""'
     that any future inventions or developments would also become
     the property of the consortium.,
     that he would refrain from discussing any of it with third parties,
     that he would refrain from publishing,
     that all plans and models would remain with the consortium after
     his departure from America>

There is a favorite saying in that small country which is to the point:
""After the Greek philosopher Pythagoras had discovered his famous theorem,
he sacrificed a whole hectatomb of oxen as a thanksgiving to the Gods.
Ever since, all the oxen in the world are running scared whenever a new
truth has been discovered"".

Knowledge of the ideas of Schauberger and Schauppeller appears to be
essential for an understanding of our changing picture of the physical
world.  As an example, the former forest ranger Viktor Schauberger had
watched numerous times some trout standing, apparently motionless, in the
strong currents of Alpine mountain streams.  This and many similar
observations of nature brought him to the gradual development of his
""Implosion-theory"" and associated hardware (see Jensen Paper).  His son is
continuing the work in the ""Pythagoras-Kepler"" school in Bad Ischl.
Another prolific researcher is the Viennese engineer Franz Seidl, known for
his studies of the use of magnetic field effects as ""trigger energy"" for
voltage and power multipliers.

HOLLAND:   A small country with a strongly developed intellectual
independence appears to be Holland, where Prof. J.M.J. Kooy developed his
space dynamics.  His hypothesis of gravitaional action is based on the
realization that all celestial bodies can be conceived as practically
transparent in relation to the size of the elementary particles and their
mutual distances in the structure of matter.  Gravitons or tachions, coming
from all directions of deep space, can pass through a celestial body like
water passes through a fishnet, and only a minute fraction of the cosmic
gravitons or tachions will be intercepted.  Study of the effects of the
tachion fields or space continuum of the fabric of material substances,
magnets and crystal lattices can lead to development of converters and
novel production facilities for readily usable, conventional E/M energy.
When the American inventor Edwin V. Gray was blocked in his efforts to
develop his ""pulsed capacitor discharge electric engine"" for which he had
received U.S. Patent #3,890,548, he found open ears and open minds in
Holland.

The fact that Gray was named ""Inventor of the Year"" from the d

raza1@gmail.com,art10.txt,", with his pretty white suit on,
   Rules the Kingdom both with Grace and Purity!
   He never touches Imperium Compound
   At least not where anyone else can see!               

   Duke Sir Deaton, was never beaten
   On the field, or in the drinking hall;
   At the Catbox War with Caid,
   Left thirty bodies piled against the wall!             

   Denis O'Titans was good at smitin'
   A Locksley Monster in every single way!
   Drank a little Imperium Compound
   And ATE Deaton's sword that day  // No! REALLY! //       

   Wotan the Mongoloid, a little bit paranoid,
   But a nice guy none the less;
   Drank a mess of Imperium Compound
   Now he's Justin du Roc, I confess!                       

   Then there's Duke Reynard, with a face like a St. Bernard
   Of the Dukes, he is the homliest
   He tends to toke up on Imperium Compound
   And go out and whomp on anybody's best!                   

   This song'll bedevil the folks at a revel,
   And most of the time it will annoy the King,
   So take a drink of Imperium Compound
   And let's go Royalty-bedeviling!                        

   Duchess Anna is quite a fan-a
   Going on a wartime shopping spree!  \\ War Point!\\
   Took a drink of Imperium Compound
   And shopped so fast we couldn't see! \\ Z-o-o-o-om!\\    (5)

  ATEN IMPERIUM (Cont.)

   Lyn of Whitewolfe, made of the right stuff,
   Twice the Queen of Atenveldt;
   Took a drink of Imperium Compound
   And the Kingdom of Caid before her knelt!              

   Duke Sir Brion, and Duke Sir Trelon,
   Won the Crown with regularity;
   Drank a lot of Imperium Compound,
   And founded a dynasty!                                 

   Stephan von Geist, was most awful nice,
   And a chivalrous fighter without any doubt
   Took a swig of Imperium Compound
   And won the Crown his first time out!                    

   All the Crusadenes were big, but not mean,
   And the finest fighters in the town.
   But they all drank Jerusalem Compound,
   Winning Crown after Crown after Crown!                 

   Good Duke Arthur couldn't get no farth-er
   A Norman King in Aten Land
   Drank too much of Imperium Compound
   And went off to conquer Engel-land!                    

   Then King Richard, a bit of a bitch, heard
   A King's Crown could be done.
   Drank a little Imperium Compound
   And became the Aten King, first one!                    

   Duchess Malinda, who doesn't do windas,
   But she does a lot of Duchess Things,
   But give her a LOT of Imperium Compound,
   And she sings and sings and sings and sings and sings!   

   Duke Sir Brion, with his pretty white suit on,
   Is a model of goodness and purity
   Never touches Imperium Compound
(spoken:) And I'll sell ya seashore property in Yuma, too!  

   Optional last verse:

   Many tales abound of Imperium Compound
   And its' strange effects on Royalty,
   But after an hour, this song has no power,
   And by now, it's boring ME!                            

   AltChorus: Oh it's too long, too long, too long
              To sing the whole song, the song, the song
              Longer than a Royal Court, it is!
              But sing it serial, this ditty Imperial
              And you'll be a bardic whiz!

        Last night I had the strangest dream in this bleak century
        I dreamed that people the world around believed in Chivalry

        I dreamed I saw a Kingly Crown enshrined in laurel leaves
        with Grace and Joy and Purity attendant at his feet

        I dreamed I saw the perfect Knight receive his accolade
        and minstrels sang and children laughed in some soft forest glade

        I dreamed I saw the finest thing that ever man could make
        grow great and strong and undefiled: Pray God I never wake!

1.           The first time I sent my device, The Heralds said to me

            ""It violates the Rule of Three""

2.           The next time I tried it, the Heralds said to me

            ""We changed the forms, and it violates the Rule of

             forms, and it violates the Rule of Three"".

5.           The fifth time I tried it, the Heralds said to me,  

            ""In a decision rendered by the College of Arms on
             August 1st, A.S. V it was decided that this style of

             it's against the Rule of Tincture, we changed the

           where is the Barony? The bugs have eaten everyone...
           termites got the stick-jocks, and all their sticks are gone!

                  For all the Lands where I have dwelt
                  Oh Atenveldt, Oh Atenveldt
                  till rivers burn and mountains melt
                  lest I forget my Atenveldt
                  From deserts stark to snow-capped peaks
                  from silent lakes and laughing creeks
                  sing: Oh let man find his heart's ease
                  on rocky plains
                  in desert breeze

                  For oft I thought of mighty men
                  who carved a Land with sword and pen
                  and lit a candle, burning bright,
                  that pierced the darkness; stirred the night!
                  tho some are gone their deeds remain
                  this sunny Crown without a stain
                  sing: Oh, their deeds were not in vain!
                  in sunlit days
                  and falling rain.....

                  So raise your banners, blazoned bright
                  Advance the Dream and Shine the Light!
                  in battle's crash and Revel's song
                  raise high the Flag and wave it long!
                  For all the Lands wherein I've dwelt
                  I love you best, my Atenveldt!
                  Sing: Oh the Joy that I have felt!
                  My Atenveldt
                  My Atenveldt

      What the use of wearing panties
      whalebone corsets of your Auntie's
      boxer shorts and other scanties
      best of all is nude
      there's such fun in going bra-less
      now that it's no longer lawless
      'specially if your figure's flawless
      best of all is nude
      nude is what you're born in
      shirts are never torn in
      underwear and lacy flimsies, garter belts and other whimsies
      yards of itchy cloth to put your form in
      ducks all do it, maidens rue it
      even ancient Picts in Britain blue it
      going naked's how to do it
      best of all is nude!

      If your garters aren't elastic
      tie them up in knots fantastic
      (panty hose is something drastic!)
      best of all is nude!
      If you're tired of wearing clotheses
      shed your garment 'mongst the roses
      never mind the old bluenoses
      best of all is nude!
      Nude is best for ducking!
      Worst for horses bucking!
      Moonlit nights will see such sights
          that are very best for fooling round
                              .....and elbows!
      Nudity is grand to see
       a well-known antidote to virginity
      take your clothes off and you'll see:
      best of all is nude!

                   once I talked to a great Grey Man
                   spun three times and said with a sigh
                   hadn't been for the Runes had his other eye!

                   prettiest thing I've ever seen
                   she went down underneath the hill
                   and came back out of her own free will

                   Brian Boru, on Irish ground
                   walked three times the Island round
                   Norsemen came lookin for a fight
                   just another Irish Saturday night!

                   Hi said Lugh on the banquest night
                   a poet and a player and a good wheelwright
                   a harper and a warrior and none the least:
                   a Druid and he got in to the Feast!

                   Harold Haardrada's face was red!
                   Came to Britain and he wound up dead

                   got six feet of English ground

                   the Legion with it's Eagles bright
                   marched into the Pictish night
                   met them there upon the sand
                   gave em up to the Wicker Man!

                   eight-legged steed and hound of Hel

                   Present is Past and Past is Me!

                   Rhiannon's Birds are still in flight

                   sang the Day and sang the Night
                   sang the Land and sang the Sea
                   sang the Song, and then sang Me!

                                  spread their seeds thruout the Land

                                  saw the Lady where she stood
                                  by the fire burning bright
                                  came to know his heart's delight!

                    WEAPONS AT THE DOOR

 Being a Polemic concerning the alleged Custom of the West Kingdom concerning 
 checking your Weapons at the Door of the Revel Hall. As the Satire is the 
 Weapon of the Bard, this said Polemic is to be checked at the Door, along with 
 swords, knives, redheaded Ladies and other such Deadly Things.....

         As I roved out to Western Lands to take the Western Air
         I went into a Revel Hall and I saw a Twelfth Night there
         but I was halted at the gate by a Privy Consellor
                 (that's the man who tells the King of the West how to go to
                  the bath room!)
         who told me I would have to check my Weapons at the door

         As I, in my astonishment, stood hung on tenter-pegs
         a Knight came in whose Prouess hung down between his legs
         the Doorman grabbed a greatsword and he struck the Knight full sore
         and gave him a reciept; he left his weapon at the door!

         a Bard was next whose goodly Voice has entertained us all
         but he, too, was prevented from entering the Hall
         and told he could not carry deadly weapons on the floor
         he left his Voice and Harp among the weapons at the door

         a Master entered graciously, a man we all know well
         who holds a 3rd Dan Black Belt, tho this he'd never tell
         the Master struggled valiantly, the Master cursed and swore
         but he left his hands, and feet, as weapons at the door

         the company was jovial, altho a bit dismayed
         for lack of proper cutlery, down to the smallest blade
         for even teeth and fingernails, each can be used in War
         were cut, and pulled, and left behind, as weapons at the door!

         And has their King not loyal Knights that He must be afraid
         of brawling in his Hall and of Assassin's bloody blade?
         the Rights of Men to carry Arms at least WE'VE not foreswore
         and a POX on them that made the Rule of Weapons at the Door!

                           THE STREETS OF ANN ARBOR

               As I walked out thru the streets of Ann Arbor
               as I walked out thru Ann Arbor one day
               I spied a young Mongol all dressed in white linen
               all dressed in white linen and cold as the clay

               I then spied another, done in on the sidewalk
               along with just about six dozen more
               their wounds were all gaping, from mace and from braoadsword
               from claymore and cannon, all dripping with gore

               what caused this grave carnage, I cried to the Monglos
               oh pray what's the reason for this awful sight
               my answer came slowly from under the corpse-pile
               ""It seems that our bark is much worse than our bite.....""

               the answer continued from pale lips a-shaking
               we sang all our songs and believed them as true
               the Dark Horde could never be beaten in battle
               we thought this was what all good Mongols could do...

               we went down to Atenveldt all for to plunder
               ""too large to defend"" was our song every night
               but Atenveldt's different from East, West or Middle
               there, even the bushes have learned how to bite!

               the Clann stole our ponies, the Scraelings our foodstuffs
               we ran into axes in AtenViking hands
               our maidens ran off with one Richard of Arkham
               and we're all that's left to return to our lands

               MacChluarains and Monsters, Lockehaven and Foxmoor
               that Kingdom is BIG and its' fighters are MEAN!
               we fought and we lost, and fled back to Ann Arbor
               we all came back home with results that you've seen

               keep away from that Land with its' cactus and marshes
               it's no place for Mongols who are bent on War
               they count their blows well, but they strick them yet better
               he crawled into his Yurt, and fell, dead, on the floor.....

       tune: the song of the Cowardly Lion, Tin Woodsman and Scarecrow
             in the movie version of the Wizard of Oz

        (Enter the Scarecrow, who singeth:)

        My wife is always nagging; my Prowess it is lagging
        I can't do anything
        she has got a reason, but revenge is out of season
        Oh I wish I could be King!

        If I just had the Crown on, I'd always have a frown on
        and the Barons on a string
        Heads they would be rolling, the Board would be cajoling
        Oh if only I was King!

        I am very fed up with the way this group is set up
        Oh I'd change everything!
        they are so high and mighty with the way that they do fight-ey
        Oh, someday I'll be King!

        Tho my wife is melancholic, and very...vitriolic
        she's a wasp without a sting!
        I'd have to supervise her with a pack of tranquilizers
        If I only was a King......

        (the Tin Woodsman joineth him, and singeth:)

        I grew up kind of cocky, and rather big, and stocky
        and straight as any rod
        on the field I'm a battallion, with the Ladies I'm a stallion
        ...Oh they'd better make me God!

        The other boys are jealous they say I'm over-zealous
        they'd do better to applaud
        the things that I am giving to this Dream that we are living
        oh I wish they'd make me God!

        They say that I'm conceited, but I'm just badly treated
        by people and by BoD
        just think of what they're missing by My Majesty dismissing
        Oh they'd better make me God!

        (the Cowardly Lion creepeth forth, and singeth:)

        Oh I could be a fighter, a great and mighty smiter
        and be the perfect knight
        it's a great and nasty shame, and everyone's to blame
        oh I wish that I could fight!

        Song of the Three (cont.)

        I could be a Cavalier drinking wine and ale and beer
        and be a gorgeous sight
        but it would cost me too much money so it isn't very funny
        oh I wish that I could fight!                               

        Let me at 'em on the field, I would surely make them yield
        to my Power and my Might
        with rattan, shinai and rapier they would nevermore escape here
        If they'd only let me fight

                She was afraid to come out to the Tourney
                She was worried that ""something might show..""
                She was afraid to come out to the Tourney
                And the poor thing did NOT want to go...

                One day in the Kingdom of the Middle
                It happened at a Tourney one day:
                The Mongols invaded the Middle
                But the Middle did not want to play...

                  (eins - zwei - drei, but the Dark Horde wouldn't die!)

                      by William Poundstone
                              1983

     Two mentalities are at work here: 1960s rock fans and 1980s
fundamentalist Christians. The idea of phonographically concealed
messages dates from the Paul McCartney death scare of 1969. For
hard-core types, the secret-message rumors never really died. Avid
rock fans have auditioned ever album release since the late 1960s
for hidden nuances. Backward messages, barely audible messages,
and messages on one stereo track only have been alleged. At the
other end of the sociosensual spectrum, fundamentalist Christians
have gotten into the act. TV programs such as PRAISE THE LORD and
THE 700 CLUB have propagated rumors of a satanic plot in the
recording industry, no less, in which various albums conceal
""backward-masked"" demonic murmurings. If THAT sounds too spacey to
be taken seriously, consider that it was the fundamentalist groups
who were behind House Resolution 6363, a bill introduced in the
U.S. House of Representatives by Robert K. Dornan (R., Calif.) in
1982 to label all suspect records: ""WARNING: THIS RECORD CONTAINS
BACKWARD MASKING THAT MAKES A VERBAL STATEMENT WHICH IS AUDIBLE
WHEN THIS RECORD IS PLAYED BACKWARD AND WHICH MAY BE PERCEPTIBLE
AT A SUBLIMINAL LEVEL WHEN THIS RECORD IS PLAYED FORWARD."" In
February 1983, the Arkansas State Senate passed a similar record-
labeling bill by a vote of 86 to 0.
     Contributing to the quasi-occult status of these rumors is
the difficulty of checking them out on home audio equipment. You
pretty much have to take someone else's word for it, or dismiss
the rumors out of hand.
     From a technical standpoint, there are four simple ways to
conceal a verbal message on a recording. The most obvious is to
record the message at a very low volume. The message may then be
recovered by turning the volume up while playing the record or
tape. If the message is faint enough, though, noise levels of home
equipment may garble it. If the accompanying music or lyrics are
loud enough, or if the message itself is indistinct or
electronically modified, it may be hard to hear on any equipment.
     A second gimmick is to record a message on one stereo track
only. Records and tapes have two independent recordings, of
course, normally played simultaneously for stereo effect. On a
record, each stereo track occupies on one side of the V-shaped
groove for the needle. On a tape, the tracks are recorded in
parallel lanes of the magnetic material. The two tracks are called
""right"" and ""left"" after the stereo speakers they will play on.
Otherwise, the tracks are interchangeable -- the sound mixer can
put anything he or she wants on each track. A message on one track
can be masked by simultaneous loud music or lyrics on the opposite
track. With normal stereo balance (or mono equipment) the loud
track drowns out the message track. At home, single-track messages
can be recovered by adjusting the stereo balance so that only the
desired track plays. Sometimes this trick also makes indistinct
words clearer. Even if the words are not exclusively on one track,
they may happen to be more audible on one track.
     A message could be recorded at a speed different from the
rest of the record. Then the record would have to be played faster
or slower than usual to recover the message. Unless the message
was at one of the standard speeds (say, 45 rpm on a 33 1/3 rpm
record), it could not be played normally on home equipment.
     The fourth and most commonly alleged trick is to record a
verbal message backward. Reversed speech has several unexpected
features. One is that syllables are not a constant in the reversal
process. A one-syllable word can have two or three syllables when
played backward. Thus ""number nine"" in the Beatles' REVOLUTION 9
reverses to ""Turn me on, dead man"" (or something like it), a jump
from three to five syllables.
     There is no simple way to predict what a word or phrase will
sound like reversed. Obviously, you can't just reverse the
letters.
     Reversed messages are difficult to recover at home. Record
turntables are not built to go backwards. Some have a neutral
setting, in which the pickup and amplifier remain active and you
can turn the record backward by hand. But hardly anyone has a
stead enough hand to produce satisfactory results.
     With patience, it is possible to reverse a cassette
recording. Transfer the music from the original record or tape
onto a blank tape cassette. Place the cassette flat on a table.
Draw our the part of the tape with the suspected message and snip
it off at both ends. Hold the tape segment horizontally. Rotate it
180 degrees, keep it horizontal at all times. This turns the tape
end for end. Splice the reversed tape segment back onto the two
loose ends of the cassette with strong adhesive tape. Reel the
tape back inside the cassette. The sliced segment will play
backward on an ordinary cassette player.
     I rented a recording studio to test the secret-message
rumors. New copiies of the records in question were transcribed on
a quarter-inch master tape. Where rumor alleged that a single
stereo track contained a message, right and left stereo tracks
were transcribed separately. Records with alleged inaudible
messages were treated similarly. To test claims of reversed
messages, recordings on the master tape were edited out and
spliced in backward. Twenty cuts or portions of cuts from sixteen
albums were tested.


""Another One Bites the Dust""
Queen, THE GAME

Rumor: When played backward, the lyrics say, ""It's fun to smoke
marijuana.""
Findings: There is something that sounds like ""It's fun to smoke
marijuana"" in the reversed music. It is repeated over and over. It
might be rendered no less faithfully, however, as ""sfun to scout
mare wanna."" This ""message"" is the reversal of the song title,
which is repeated as a line in the song.
     Let's make a distinction between engineered and phonetic
reversals. When an artist records a verbal statement, reverses it
by turning the tape end for end, mixes the reversed statement onto
a master tape, and has records and tapes produced from the master,
that is an engineered reversal. When the phonetic properties of
song lyrics are such that they can be reversed to sound like
something else, that is a phonetic reversal.
     ""It's fun to smoke marijuna"" is clearly a phonetic reversal.
The lyrics are perfectly plain played forward (""Another one bites
the dust""), no so plain played backward (""sfun to scout mare
wanna""). With an engineered reversal, the opposite should hold
true: gibberish forward, clear as a bell backward. Some are
prepared to believe that phonetic reversals are just as
intentional as engineered reversals -- that the songwriter
painstakinginly planned the phonetic double-entendre. In the
absence of confirming evidence, that just doesn't wash. It's too
easy to find coincidences. If, for example, the letters of the
alphabet are recited in conventional fashion (Ay, Bee, Cee, etc.)
and reversed, at least five sound like English language words. D
reverses to ""eden,"" F becomes ""pray,"" S becomes ""say,"" V becomes
""even,"" and Z becomes ""easy."" ""It's fun to smoke marijuana"" is
likewise a coincidence.


""A Child is Coming""
Jefferson Starship, BLOWS AGAINST THE EMPIRE

Rumor: When played backward, ""son of Satan.""
Findings: Another phonetic coincidence. The repeated ""It's getting
better"" reverses to an iffy ""son of Satan,"" the ""of"" drawn out and
the ""Satan"" strongly accented on the first syllable.


""Eldorado""
Electric Light Orchestra, ELDORADO

Rumor: When played backward, ""He is the nasty one/ Christ, you're
infernal/ It is said we're dead men/ Everyone who has the mark
will live.""
Findings: Coincidence. The supposed message lurks around the line
""On a voyage of no return to see."" Reversed, this passage becomes
the expected syllable salad -- no one hearing it would describe it
as anything but reversed music. Only if you listen while reading
along with what you're supposed to hear will you get anything. The
rumored version of the message is somewhat fudged. The passage
sounds more like ""He's to nasty one/ Christ you are, Christ,
you're fernal/ There wiss uh, we're dead men..."" There is no ""in""
in what is taken to be ""infernal."" The line that is supposed to be
""Everyone who has the mark will live"" isn't even close, though the
syllable count is right.


""Shoo Be Doo""
The Cars, CANDY-O

Rumor: When played backward, the word ""Satan"" repeated
approximately eleven times.
Findings: Coincidence. The rumor refers to the reversal of the ""Shoo
be doo, shoo be doo, shoo be doo..."" near the end of the song. Given
the mysterious logic of reversed phonemes, these three-syllable units
can be hard as a repeated two-syllable word. The word sounds a little
like ""Satan.""


""Snowblind""
Styx, PARADISE THEATER

Rumor: According to a mimeographed list of suspect records distributed
by Congressman Dornan, the words ""Satan move through our voices"" when
played backwards.
Findings: Negative. Despite repeated listenings, it was not even
possible to identify the part of the reversed track that Dornan et al.
are talking about.


""Stairway to Heaven""
Led Zeppelin, untitled, a.k.a. STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN

Rumor: In reverse, ""I live for Satan... The Lord turns me off...
There's no escaping it... Here's to my sweet Satan... There's power in
Satan... He will give you 666.""
Findings: Coincidence. If you listen very carefully to the ""And it
makes me wonder"" lines in reverse, you'll hear something approaching
""There's no escaping it."" A better description is ""There's no escape
do."" Knock of the last syllable, and you have ""There's no escape,"" a
complete, intelligible sentence in reverse. It's there, all right, but
it's not an unlikely enough coincidence to -- well, make you wonder.
      The ""Satan"" in ""I live for Satan"" is good and clear. The ""I live
for"" part isn't. The other alleged lines are unremarkable. All are
phonetic reversals of the entirely lucid forward lyrics and obviously
just accidents.


""When Electricity Came to Arkansas""
Black Oak Arkansas, BLACK OAK ARKANSAS and RONCH AND ROLL

Rumor: In reverse, ""Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan. He is God. He
is God.""
Findings: The BLACK OAK ARKANSAS cut was reversed. Again, pairs of
reversed syllables are being freely interpreted as ""Satan."" ""He is
God"" was not identifiable.


""Rain""
The Beatles, HEY JUDE

Rumor: Unintelligible lyrics at the end are reversed.
Findings: A true engineered reversal and not really a secret. ""Rain""
seems to have been the first popular recording to incorporate an
obviously reversed lyric. The story is that John Lennon accidentally
spliced the last part of the song in backward and liked the effect.
When reversed, the strange-sounding vocals at the end become
intelligible as a reprise starting with the drawn-out word
""sunshine.""
      The reversal is less apparent to the casual listener than it
might be because the accompanying music is not reversed. The ending
fits in smoothly with the rest of the song, the vocals suggesting a
foreign language.


""Fire on High""
Electric Light Orchestra, FACE THE MUSIC

Rumor: When played backward, ""The music is reversible, but time --
turn back!""
Findings: ""Fire on High"" is instrumental. About twenty-six seconds
into the music, scrambled speech is heard. It is mostly louder than
the accompanying music and begins with a two-syllable unit repeated
several times. The seeming speech lasts for about fourteen seconds.
      Reversing the music confirms that there is a true, engineered
message. In reverse, a voice (Jeff Lynne's?) says, ""The music is
reversible, but time -- turn back! Turn back! Turn back! Turn back!""
All the words are clear and unambiguous. Anyone comparing this to the
alleged reversal on ELO's ""Eldorado"" will have no trouble telling
which is genuine.


""Goodbye Blue Sky""
Pink Floyd, THE WALL

Rumor: In reverse, ""You have discovered the secret message.""
Findings: The ""secret message"" is at the very end of the instrumental
passage following the ""Goodbye Blue Sky"" vocals. It comes just before
the words ""What shall we do"" at the start of the song that is
identified as ""Empty Spaces"" on the record label and as ""What shall we
do now?"" on the record sleeve. Played forward, the message is less
apparent than the FACE THE MUSIC reversal: A reasonably attentive
listener might play THE WALL through and not catch it. It suggests
speech not quite close enough to be overheard. In context this is not
unusual because the ""Goodbye Blue Sky"" instrumental passage includes
""airport noises"" and other sound effects. A loud climax in the music
further masks the unintelligible voice.
      When played backward, the voice (Roger Waters?) plainly intones,
""Congratulations, you have just discovered the secret message. Please
send your answer to old Pink, care of the funny farm..."" As the voice
fades out, there may be another word -- perhaps ""Chalfonte or
""Chelsea"" -- after ""funny farm.""


""Heavy Metal Poisoning""
Styx, KILROY WAS HERE

Rumor: A red sticker on the KILROY WAS HERE cover warns, ""By order of
the Majority for Musical Morality, this album contains secret backward
messages...""
Findings: This is a case of second-generation backward-masking. Styx'
PARADISE THEATER did not contain a backward message, though a lot of
people said it did. So Styx has included a sure enough backward
message on KILROY WAS HERE. It is at the very beginning of ""Heavy
Metal Poisoning."" The reversed speech last about three seconds. There
is no musical background. The words reverse to ""Annuit coeptis. Novus
ordo seclorum."" This is the Latin motto encircling the pyramid on the
back of a dollar bill. The usual translation: ""God has favored our
undertakings. A new order of the ages.""
      The cover sticker's ""Majority for Musical Morality"" is a
fictitious Falwellesque group in the KILROY WAS HERE video. Although
the sticker suggests a plurality of ""messages,"" only one was found.


Space between ""I'm So Tired"" and ""Blackbird""
The Beatles, untitled, a.k.a. THE WHITE ALBUM

Rumor: A reversed message. At the time of the Paul-is-dead stories,
the segue from ""I'm So Tired"" to ""Blackbird"" was offered as evidence.
It was held to contain John Lennon's voice, reveresed, saying ""Paul is
dead, miss him, miss him, miss him."" That interpretation seems
unlikely now, but there is a mysterious low muttering between the
songs.
Findings: The mumbling is actually just to the ""I'm So Tired"" side of
the shiny ""space"" between cuts on the record. Each of the stereo
tracks was recorded separately, twice, and a copy of each track was
reversed. This produced four versions of the two-second passage: right
forward, left forward, right reversed, and left reversed. All were
equally unintelligible. It was not even apparent whether the voice is
forward or reversed. Nor could John Lennon be identified as the
speaker. There are nine or ten syllables. The first six (when played
forward) are a two-syllable unit repeated three times. There is little
or no difference betwen the stereo tracks. Any claimed interpretation
of the sounds seems doubtful.


""Strawberry Fields Forever""
The Beatles, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR

Rumor: It was, of course, claimed that John Lennon says ""I buried
Paul"" at the end. (It's forward, at the very end after the music
fades to complete silence, returns, and starts to fade out again.)
But Lennon told ROLLING STONE that the words are ""cranberry
sauce.""
Findings: They are ""cranberry sauce."" The ""sauce""/""Paul"" part is
indistinct, but the first syllable sounds a lot more like ""cran""
than ""I.""


""Baby You're a Rich Man""
The Beatles, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR

Rumor: On one of the tracks the line ""Baby you're a rich man too""
is sung as ""Baby you're a rich fag Jew,"" a dig at Brian Epstein.
Or some think it's ""rich fat Jew"" and claim it as evidence of
Beatle anti-Semitism.
Findings: Negative. The two stereo tracks are nearly identical.
It's always possible to hear words as similar-sounding words, but
basically, the lyrics jibe with the published version.


""Revolution 9""
The Beatles, untitled, a.k.a. THE WHITE ALBUM

Rumor: Various reversed and/or one-track speech. The reversal of
""Number nine"" to ""Turn me on, dead man"" has pretty much been
discounted as coincidence (though it appears on Congressman
Dornan's list).
Findings: Distinction between lyrics and any hidden message blurs
on ""Revolution 9."" The eight-minute cut is a montage of sounds
collected by John Lennon and Yoko Ono. It includes discordant
music, radio broadcasts, sirens, applause, gunfights, sports
cheers, the crackling of a fire, screams, a baby gurgling, a choir
singing, and much that cannot be identified. For this
investigation, ""Revolution 9"" was transcribed four times, twice on
each stereo channel. One copy of each of the tracks was reversed.
The four resulting versions were compared with each other and
against the original two-channel version.
     ""Revolution 9"" contains a lot of talking. Played in stereo,
forward, the longest stretch of understandable speech is probably
an announcer saying, ""...every one of them knew that as time went
by they'd get a little bit older and a little bit slower...""
     One believable instance of reversed speech occurs: someone
saying ""Let me out! Let me out!"" (once held to represent McCartney
in his totaled Aston-Martin). Two iffy reversals occur on the
backward recording of the right stereo track:""She used to be
assistant"" and ""There were two men..."" Neither is clear enough or
long enough to be convincing. Some of the music, including the
recurring theme, sounds more natural in reverse.
     ""Turn me on, dead man"" is a typical phonetic reversal. The
forward ""number nine"" (repeated throughout the cut) is clear; the
reversal is slurred -- something like ""turn me on dedmun."" It has
been claimed that ""number nine"" must be pronounced with a British
accent or with some careful inflection in order to reverse to
""Turn me on, dead man."" This seems not to be so. As an experiment,
three American-accent renderings of ""number nine"" were reversed.
All sound about as much like ""Turn me on, dead man"" as the record
did. Like the other phonetic reversals, ""Turn me on, dead man""
must be considered a coincidence.
     Much of ""Revolution 9"" is on one stereo track only. Near the
end a voice says ""A fine natural imbalance...the Watusi...the
twist...Eldorado...Eldorado."" ""A fine natural imbalance"" is on the
right track only, though the words that follow are in stereo. One
of the longer bits of speech -- ""Who could tell what he was
saying? His voice was low and his [unintelligible] was high and
his eyes were low"" -- is clear on the left track, a bare whisper
on the right.
     There is a stereophonically concealed ""secret message"" on
""Revolution 9."" The words are on the right track. They begin about
four minutes, fifty-eight seconds into the cut and run for about
twenty-two seconds. They are not likely to be noticed in stereo
because of the much louder left track. The sound of applause
begins on the left track at about five minutes, one second into
the cut. Deafening noises -- the clapping, sirens, music --
continue on the left track until five minutes, forty seconds. It
may or may not have been Lennon's and Ono's intention to conceal
the spoken passage. Given the haphazard quality of ""Revolution 9,""
the concealment may have been accidental. To recover the passage,
the left track must be switched off. The right track can then be
heard to contain a sound like a stopwatch ticking, behind these
words:

     So the wife called, and we better go to see a
     surgeon....[A SCREAM MUFFLES A LINE THAT SOUNDS LIKE
     Well, what with the prices, the prices have snowballed,
     no wonder it's closed.] ...So any and all, we went to
     see the dentist instead, who gave him a pair of teeth,
     which wasn't any good at all. So instead of that he
     joined the bloody navy and went to sea.
                      by William Poundstone
                              1986

     There really are backward messages on rock albums. And the
controversy over ""backward masking"" and ""porn rock"" has inspired a
whole new spate of messages. There may have been more genuine
backward messages in the past few years than ever before.
     The backward message controversy is usually traced to the
1960s and John Lennon's avant-garde sound mixing on such tracks as
""Revolution 9"" on the Beatles' WHITE ALBUM. Lennon probably wasn't
trying to conceal a message so much as create an interesting
sound.
     The matter might have ended right there had it not been for
the Paul McCartney death rumor. College kids tried playing Beatles
records forward, backward, and at various speeds to find ""clues""
to McCartney's fate. In the process they found snippets of speech
from Lennon's experiments. Even after McCartney was found safe and
sound in Scotland, some listeners continued to look for hidden
messages.
     Somehow, fundamentalist Christian groups became convinced
(ca. 1982) that the alleged messages were commercials for devil
worship. Not a single indisputable satanic message has turned up,
but there were scattered attempts to ban or label certain albums.
In 1986 one fundamentalist group announced that the theme song for
the old MR. ED TV show contains the word ""Satan"" when played
backward.)
     Ironically, the publicity accorded nonexistent messages has
inspired several artists -- among them porn rock hearing witness
Frank Zappa -- to hide real background messages in their music.
It's easy to do.
     The performer speaks or sings the message normally, then
reverses the tape, which is mixed into the soundtrack. This is all
accomplished simply enough at any recording studio.
     What's not so simple is playing it back. More home record,
cassette, and compact disk players won't play backward. You can
turn a record backward with a pencil eraser, but it's not good for
the needle or the turntable. The only way to reproduce the message
with full fidelity is to use a professional-quality reel-to-reel
tape player and splice the tape in backward.
     We used the facilities of KLOS radio in Los Angeles to
reverse some recent records containing true backward messages.


""Secret Messages""
Electric Light Orchestra, SECRET MESSAGES

ELO's ELDORADO album was among those alleged to contain satanic
backward masked messages. A patient listening to ELDORADO played
backward reveals no such messages. You hear only what you ought to
hear -- the reversed lyrics of the songs, which sound nothing like
the ""messages"" claimed to be there. In the wake of such
allegations, ELO did put an (innocuous) backward message on their
FACE THE MUSIC album. Perhaps they thought this would show how
silly the allegations were. Instead, the backward-masking people
seized on this as proof that the other ""messages"" were real. In
the latest volley, ELO has named an album after the controversy.
     In Britain (where the backward-masking issue is viewed as an
American eccentricity), the cover of SECRET MESSAGES has a mock
warning label to youth about the hidden label. Word of the albums'
impending release in the United States caused enough of a furor to
chill CBS Records into deleting the cover blurb.
     The reversed message is easy to find. It's at the beginning
of the first song, which is itself called ""Secret Messages."" You
can hear reversed speech when you play the record normally. A
voice intones ""secret messages"" -- forward -- in the middle of the
reversed speech, lest anyone dare be so unhip as to not know
what's going on.
     We transferred a new copy of SECRET MESSAGES to reel-to-reel
tapes and played it backward. The backward message goes: ""WELCOME
TO THE BIG SHOW/ WELCOME TO THE BIG SHOW.""
     That's it.


""Ya Hozna""
Frank Zappa, THEM OR US

""Ya Hozna,"" a six-minute composition on the first record of the
THEM OR US double album, is ENTIRELY backward. The albums' inner
cover, which includes lyrics for the other songs, says, ""backwards
vocal -- you figure it out"" of this cut. It credits Frank and Moon
Zappa, George Duke, and Napoleon Murphy Brock as vocalists.
     Played forward, ""Ya Howza"" sounds like a record played
backward -- reasonably so. The vocals are prominent and
unintelligible. Moon Zappa's voice is curiously recognizable, even
in reverse. It is hard to tell whether the music was recorded
forward or backward.
     When ""Ya Howza"" is played in reverse, you discover that the
music is virtually a palindrome -- it sounds about the same
forward and backward. The voices are all backward. In some cases
they have been modified electronically. Many of the words are
muffled. Even after repeated careful listening on both stereo
tracks, it is difficult to make out many of the lyrics. It doesn't
help that some of the words seem to be stream-of-consciousness
nonsense. Some of the unintelligible stuff sounds like opera.
     Starting at the beginning of the reversed tape -- the end of
the forward tape -- the clearer vocals go like this: ""I am the
heaven, I am the water."" This is in a hymnlike register. ""You are
a lonely little girl./ But your mommy and your daddy hold you."" A
singsong synthesizer voice.
     The most interesting part of the lyrics is an intermittently
orgasmic rap in Moon Zappa's Valley Girl voice. There are three
short monologues:

I'm like green!
I'm like squat!
I'm like soul!
Repeat, like soul!
I'm like pull, push,
Okay, like slow, slow.

You're never too old
Like slow, like slow, like slow
Okay, I like it.


All right, faster, faster,
Go, do it, do it twice,
Yeah, that feels good,
I'm looking great,
Yeah, fer shure!
Like, no way!


""No Anchovies, Please""
J. Geils Band, LOVE STINKS

""No Anchovies, Please"" is a novelty song, really a narration with
sound effects, about a woman who is kidnapped after eating
anchovies. She is taken to a ""foreign-speaking"" country. The sound
effect of the foreign tongue seems reversed. When you do play it
in reverse, it becomes: ""It doesn't take a genius to know the
difference between chicken shit and chicken salad.""


""Darling Nikki""
Prince, PURPLE RAIN

""Darling Nikki,"" cited as porn rock before Congress, is about a
dominatrix in a hotel lobby masturbating with a magazine. In part,
the complaint was that the album cover (flowers, and Prince on a
motorcycle) wasn't explicit enough to warn kids of the suggestive
lyrics. Senator Paula Hawkins apparently was not aware of a
backward message hidden in ""Darling Nikki."" The last thirty-five
seconds of the song is gibberish. The music changes abruptly and
becomes a repeated glottal sound. Then a two-syllable sound is
repeated twice, something like ""heaven, heaven."" Unintelligible
speech follows. At the end is a sound reminiscent of rain or bacon
frying , and wind sounds.
     Played backward, the message becomes:

     Hello, how are you?
     I'm fine 'cause I know that the Lord is coming soon.
     Coming, coming soon.

     It is clearly Prince and the Revolution singing this. The
words are clear but the intonation is funny -- the linger on some
words. Perhaps this is to make the reversed message you hear
playing the record normally a little less conspicuous.
     This is a weird reversal of the supposed secret message
menace. Raunchy forward lyrics conceal a religious secret message.


""Judas Kiss""
Petra, MORE POWER TO YOU

Petra is an obscure group that sings religious songs to a rock
beat. As further proof that things have gone full circle, the
backward-masking controversy prompted Petra to include a wholesome
backward message on their MORE POWER TO YOU album. It is in the
transition between two songs, just before ""Judas Kiss."" Clearly
audible gibberish reverses to this (the husky voice a cross
between George Beverly Shea and Dee Snider): ""What are you looking
for the Devil for, when you ought to be looking for the Lord?""

AFL JoyceM Welcome to the Apple II Music & Sound chat - our discussion will
           be on NoiseTracker - the new FTA music program for the GS.  AFA
           Gene will be our host this evening...Gene, the floor is yours :)

AFA Gene   Hi all... well first I'd like to point out, if y'all aren't aware
           yet, that a spanking new version of NoiseTracker has recently
           been released (9 days ago) and is now available in our New Files
           library. It is version 0.5. I haven't played around with it much
           yet, but it's supposed to fix a lot of the little bugs in 0.3
           (the first version we had online).  NoiseTracker also includes
           the ability to directly import ""modules,"" a term used for a
           certain type of Amiga song file which has become popular among PC
           users using the SoundBlaster sound card.

           Now, via NT, these ""MOD"" files are accessible by the GS. We
           expect to see a lot of activity on this end as far as ports from
           the PC and Amiga go. Note that you should be able to go straight
           to the PC music forum and download any recently uploaded MOD
           songfiles (there was a bug in the first wide release of the PCAO
           software, however, so a bunch of files with dates between around
           March 1991 and September 1991 may not download properly. Note that
           to use these PC MOD files, you'll have to rename the downloaded
           file ""MOD.xxxxxx"" if you want it to show up automatically in NT's
           ""open"" dialog box. (On the PC, all MOD files are named
           ""xxxxxxxx.MOD"" instead.)   Also, if the files are packed with ZIP
           compression, you'll need a program from the Communications Forum
           called AGATE -- it's a terminal program that includes the ability
           to unpack ZIP files.

           Now, I guess the best thing to do would be to talk about our
           favorite songfiles... there have been a few complaints, in fact,
           that people were not being ""descriptive"" enough in their file
           descriptions for uploads in describing the songs.

AFC Eddie  ?

AFA Gene   GA ed

AFC Eddie  Once a MOD file is unpacked with Agate, is a file type change
           needed?

AFA Gene   Nope, since all that NT looks for is the ""MOD."" being the first
           four characters in the filename.

AFC Eddie  OK, Thanks!

Deanna7332 Question...

JonL7      Can you list some of the features of Noisetracker?

AFA Gene   (you don't even need that ""MOD."" if you want to type the name in
           directly.)

Deanna7332 Did any of these mod files have anything to do with FTA's ""Module
           A""

AFA Gene   Sure Jon, right after we answer Deanna's question. Deanna, you
           mean ""Modulae?""

Deanna7332 Yes, that's it.

AFA Gene   Modulae was a demo written by FTA last year. (i'll get to you in a
           sec Doors).  It used SoundSmith v0.95 for all it's music. There
           is no connection between MOD files and Modulae by FTA.

Deanna7332 Throughout the demo it said ""Loading modules""

AFA Gene   Those ""modules"" are not the same as Amiga soundfile ""modules"" --
           you see, what Modulae really was was a ""stringing together"" of a
           bunch of neat little tiny demos that FTA had written. So they
           called each little demo a ""module"" and thus the entire demo as a
           whole, ""Modulae"" (fancy plural of module?)

Deanna7332 Ok I understand.  Thank you. :)

AFL JoyceM Latin, Gene :)

AFA Gene   The term ""MODule"" from the Amiga comes from the idea that all the
           stuff needed to play the songfile (all the instruments + the
           sequence file) are included into one file, the ""module.""

TheDoors1  Gene, I have tried to d/l some recent uploaded MODs in the PC
           music area and still the problem exists.

AFA Gene   As I understand it, the problem was fixed VERY recently (correct
           me on this Joyce) and files uploaded as recently as early
           November still might not work depending on the version of the
           PCAO software that the uploader used.

AFL JoyceM Actually, Gene...I was under the impression that it had been, but
           if Doors is still having a problem, then it must not be fixed.

AFA Gene   What date was the file you tried to d/l, Door?

TheDoors1  umm 11/17, around there

AFA Gene   hmmm.... well i can tell you one thing... if it didn't work, don't
           waste your time again later... the problem is in the Apple
           software's method of d/lling files, and there are no plans to
           upgrade the Apple AO software.

AFL JoyceM I will endeavor to get an answer to that PC downloading
           problem/question :)

ThomasK63  i have a quick question... what can you use to unpack amiga mod
           files? On the PC side, that is.

TheDoors1  Agate Thomas

ELECTMUSIC Doors... what happens on after downloading..

Deanna7332 If it's LZHed you can't unless you have an IBM or
           PC/Transporter.

AFA Gene   If GS-ShrinkIt doesn't have that ability, i don't think there
           exists any such utility on the GS.

TheDoors1  What do you mean Elect?

ELECTMUSIC After you download the file... where do you encounter a problem?

TheDoors1  ok, you know when you download the file and at some point in the
           download the file starts to appear on your screen.  That's when I
           cancel it.

ThomasK63  I am sure soething good can be made w/out resorting to Amiga
           files

AFC Eddie  Yes, Doors, I believe the problem is with the PC software it was
           UL'd with.

TheDoors1  yeah Eddie.

GNO Tim    Amiga MOD files are typically compressed using LHarc.  I've
           uncompressed several on my Unix machine at school.

ThomasK63  good time for someone to make a lharc unpacker...

AFC DYAJim someone might be ;)

GNO Tim    Several people are already

AFC Eddie  Can't wait, Jim!

AFA Gene   Jon, did you have a question?

JonL7      The features of Noisetracker :)

AFA Gene   Oh yes... okay, here goes, in a nutshell, from most important to
           least:


AFA Gene   *  ability to import MOD files

           *  ability to import Soundsmith files

           *  ProDOS 8 based

           *  virtually no editing abilities (not a feature but important to
           know)

AFC DYAJim :)

AFA Gene   *  forgot: and the most important feature of all, the ability to
           hold instrument files in regular system RAM instead of DOC RAM,
           allowing for instruments far beyond the regular 64K limit found
           in ALL other GS music programs.

ThomasK63  I'll buy that!

TheDoors1  I have another question...when you're ready.

AFA Gene   GA Doors

TheDoors1  ok..is it true that NoiseTracker will take in soundsmith files and
           play them more clearly

AFA Gene   Well, as far as ""what you hear,"" yes there is a definite
           difference with some instruments. It does NOT play the sounds
           more ""clearly,"" but it just plays them in a different way. What
           many people seem to like about this ""different way"" is that
           sustained instruments (i.e. instruments designed to be played
           in a loop to simulate a long held note) seem to work better (or
           perhaps simply the way they were originally intended to work).

TheDoors1  I see

Deanna7332 Which takes up more space - MOD or NT  w/soundfile ?

AFA Gene   Deanna, it depends a few things, such as how big the sequence is,
           how many instruments you have, etc. Once you have a lot of
           assorted files, it'll probably average out to be about the same
           give or take a hundred blocks on your HD. So it basically depends
           on whether you prefer to have your instruments separate or not.

Deanna7332 Does playing quality differ with either one ?

AFA Gene   Nope. It's exactly the same either way. Loading time is the same
           too.

AFC Eddie  Can NT save songs as MOD files?

AFA Gene   Nope. It has options for Open and Close module, but these are
           still inactive.

AFA Gene   If there are no more questions, I'd like to talk about which NT
           files out there are the ""hottest,"" since this info could be
           useful to many users who are interested in downloading NT/MOD
           files.

           My personal favorite is ""Lambada,"" which is supplied by FTA with
           the program but is available separately on America
           Online.Everything about this file is really impressive except
           perhaps the sound quality of the horn-ish melody instrument.

           What about y'all, what are your favorite NT files?

AFL JoyceM Gene, there is a classical song for NT, but can't remember the
           name, but it is good.

AFC Eddie  I like Dragnet!

ELECTMUSIC So do I Ed

TheDoors1  I like Seven something

Deanna7332 My most favorite of all mod files is Pleasure Principle

AFC Eddie  <--appreciate's Greg's taste!

AFL JoyceM :)

AFA Gene   Deanna, i assume you got that from a local board?

Deanna7332 I got it from the PC forum here.

TheDoors1  I saw it there also

Deanna7332 I think under ""Pleasure""

AFA Gene   Would you be able to upload it here? If it's really that good, we
           ought to have it available directly in our oun NT lib here (BTW
           folks, we will be releasing a new NoiseTracker software library
           soon!)

AFC Eddie  What a Forum!!!

Deanna7332 That sounds great!

AFL JoyceM Gene, do you think it will be possible for synthLAB files to be
           converted to MOD files?

AFL JoyceM MOD files?

AFA Gene   I doubt it, Joyce. The formats are so diametrically opposed in
           their entire basis of their file formats that it wouldn't be
           worth the time for a programmer to develop such a convertor.

Deanna7332 Isn't it possible to move the mod file from the PC forum to our
           music library?

AFA Gene   But..... it might be worth the time for a MIDI File Format to MOD
           convertor, since these two formats are more widely accepted.

Nuzz       they have nothing better to do Gene

ELECTMUSIC Gene.. some interesting similarities with DTune and NTracker

AFA Gene   They lose the file, tho, Deanna. :)

AFL JoyceM In what way, Greg?

ELECTMUSIC Both Prodos 8

Deanna7332 Shhh they won't know a thing :)

ELECTMUSIC I also believe Bill uses a shuttling of sound data between Doc
           Ram and Ram.

AFC Eddie  Interesting, Greg.

ELECTMUSIC Thats how he gets some of the excellent instrument quality

AFC Eddie  But Diversitune has that one distinction:  MIDI input.

AFL JoyceM Deanna, we would greatly appreciate it if you would upload that
           'Pleasure' song to our library :)

ELECTMUSIC Agreed Ed.. one of the factors FTA doesn't like to incorporate
           into their programs.

Deanna7332 I'll u/l it tonight if possible.

AFL JoyceM Thanks :)

AFC Eddie  Thanks, Deanna!

AFL JoyceM I will send Bill B a copy of NoiseTracker + some MOD files...to
           see what comments we get from him (will send when I get back).

AFC DYAJim What ever happened to that diversitune upgrade that was talked
           about ?

ELECTMUSIC That would be interesting Joyce

AFC Eddie  Bill apparently still working on it, Jim.

ELECTMUSIC I am sure he would appreciate the Prodos 8

AFC DYAJim good..

AFL JoyceM Jim...RSN....he was hoping by Christmas (this year), but he is
           soooo busy with his job, who knows?

AFC DYAJim Oh yeah, I noticed the speed calcuation in NT .5 is inaccurate
           :)

AFC DYAJim I recall he has set a lot of Christmas projected dates :)

ELECTMUSIC He was one of the first ""Free Tools"" experts in breaking all the
           rules for economic sake.

AFC DYAJim like for the vaporware DT inst editor like 2 years ago.

Deanna7332 Are there any Christmas Mod or NT songs?

AFC Eddie  Oh yeah, Diversi-Editor!

AFL JoyceM I know, Jim - but that I know he has been working on.

AFC DYAJim he projected Christmas for it, and it never came :)

AFA Gene   Not yet in AMS, but hopefully the Holiday Contest will change all
           that. :)

AFC DYAJim I look foreward to any upgrades..

AFL JoyceM Not that I am aware of Deanna - you have some?  hint, hint

Deanna7332 Nope sorry.  I was hoping there were some that could be u/led
           here

AFC DYAJim I'll be breaking out the xmas tune book rsn.. I should be able to
           midi a few :) (which rules out nt)

AFL JoyceM Question...

AFC Eddie  It would be more appropriate to have a converter from Appleworks
           spreadsheet to MOD than from MIDI!

AFL JoyceM If I got ahold of an Amiga song (MOD) disk...how would I convert
           them for here?

AFA Gene   You mean an Amiga-formatted disk?

AFL JoyceM Yes

AFC DYAJim Ack.. methinks you need an amiga and a null modem cable or a
           modem.

AFA Gene   Methinks Jim is right

AFC DYAJim LOL!!  Design your music in the spreadsheet then import to NT :)
           IT might actually have better editing?!! :)

AFC Eddie  Right!

AFL JoyceM Me thinks he is right.  If I had them upload to me, would that
           work?

AFA Gene   Yep; should work like a charm.

AFC DYAJim Yah.. as long as they're coming from an amiga

AFL JoyceM Great....I will work on that when I get back  (making note now).

AFL JoyceM Gene, will you get some of those files (NT) sent to that area
           tonight?  If so, I will leave the needed message :)

AFA Gene   That's all I have planned for tonight's chat, Joyce. Yep, I'll
           move some files right now.

AFL JoyceM Thanks...

AFL JoyceM Then we should have our NoiseTracker Library by end of the week in
           AMS :)

ELECTMUSIC Gene... quick question:  Are you launching NTracker from a 3.5
           disk?

AFL JoyceM Okay, guys...I will see you all the week of December 11th (may the
           4th) as I am off on vacation.

AFA Gene   Yep greg

AFC JohnC  Where are you going?

ELECTMUSIC Do you encounter out of memory problems

AFL JoyceM Night all...and Gene, thanks for an excellent chat and great
           explanations of NoiseTracker.

Nuzz       Joyce, I have good news for FutureSound owners. SoundConvert will
           support it in the first release

AFC Eddie  Great, Mike!

AFA Gene   Greg, i always keep my RAMdisk at 0 when using noisetracker. Not
           only are

AFC JohnC  Mike...SoundConvert...released?

AFL JoyceM Great, Mike.  When can we get SoundConvert, Mike? and FutureSound
           :)

AFA Gene   there a couple of bugs with memory management, but if you're
           loading in a MOD file that's really big, NT will eat your RAMdisk.

AFC Eddie  Sounds good.

Nuzz       The manual is being ""layout"". Release date should be about 1st
           week of Dec

ELECTMUSIC Tnxs Gene

AFC JohnC  YES.......WTG Nuzz!!!!!!!!

Deanna7332 Yes, why is there on some MOD files a stop somewhere in the middle
           ?

Deanna7332 That's really frustrating!

AFL JoyceM Mike, leave me E-Mail on when and how I can send your the $$ to
           get it.

AFL JoyceM Again...night all

Nuzz       gee John, I had to do something to explain the delay :)

ELECTMUSIC Thanks Gene for a GREAT chat!

    John Michael Osbourne, (known as ""Ozzy"" to his fans), has in his long 
career as vocalist for Black Sabbath had his work with the group misconstrued 
as advocating Satanism.  In a 1983 radio special featuring Ozzy, the 
interviewer expressed precisely this point; ""...Ozzy has always been shrouded 
in the darkest of Satanic imagery.  Yet if you really listen to his music, 
you'll find that what he is saying differs greatly from his image....""(1)  Even 
the group's image has often been described as ""occult and diabolic"".(2)

    The important point to remember here is to differentiate between appearance 
and reality.  Although the name ""Black Sabbath"" conjures up images of witches 
and sorcerers paying homage to Satan for the powers bestowed upon them, this 
does not make it safe to assume that the group that went by this name 
necessarily drew the inspiration from the occult.(3)  The closest they ever 
came to it was a gothic horror film featuring Boris Karloff as narrator; they 
adopted their name directly from the name of this film.(4)  Black Sabbath was 
involved in the black arts as much as Karloff practiced casting spells off-
screen.  Tony Iommi, the group's guitarist, summed it up best when he described 
the group as having basically ""...the same appeal as a horror movie.  It's all 
an act.""(5)










    Just as their film counterpart did, Ozzy and Sabbath found the occult 
mythos to be an effective vehicle for powerful social commentary; particularly 
when put in the context of heavy-metal rock and roll.  Ozzy himself noted that 
there are ""...people who pick up my [album] cover[s] and go...'This guy's got 
to be singing about Devil, doom, death and destruction.'  Which is not the 
case....""(6)

    The late Lester Bangs likened the group to Bob Dylan and William Burroughs, 
describing them all as ""...moralists...trying to deal with a serious present 
situation in an honest way....""(7)  Ozzy and Black Sabbath merely bring to 
light the many evils of our world in their work, to try and make us realize 
that we are all victim to their influence.  They hope to make us recognize 
these evils so that we may take up arms against them; a point Ozzy emphatically 
stresses:  ""...one thing everybody has got to understand about Black Sabbath's 
lyrics.  They're not downer lyrics, they're just telling everybody where it's 
at...""(8)  He also cites the group's most controversial tune, ""Black Sabbath"", 
as a response to the ignorant hippie culture still force when the tune was 
written in 1970:  ""The hippies said: 'The world is beautiful man.' (sic)  You 
only had to look around you to see how crappy it was.  It was ridiculous 
listening to that stuff, let alone playing it, so we just wrote about the world 
the way it really was and how it affected us - and we felt better in ourselves 
because we were really being honest....""(9)

    I   1   HAVE YOU EVER THOUGH ABOUT YOUR SOUL-
        2   CAN IT BE SAVED?
        3   OR PERHAPS YOU THINK THAT WHEN YOU ARE DEAD
        4   YOU JUST STAY IN YOUR GRAVE.
        5   IS GOD JUST A THOUGHT WITHIN YOUR HEAD OR IS
        6   HE A PART OF YOU?
        7   IS CHRIST JUST A NAME THAT YOU READ IN A BOOK
        8   WHEN YOU WERE AT SCHOOL?

    II  9   WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT DEATH DO YOU LOSE
        10  YOUR BREATH OR DO YOU KEEP YOUR COOL?
        11  WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE THE POPE ON THE END
        12  OF A ROPE - DO YOU THINK HE'S A FOOL?
        13  WELL I'VE SEEN THE TRUTH - YES I'VE SEEN 
        14  THE LIGHT AND I'VE CHANGED MY WAYS.
        15  AND I'LL BE PREPARED WHEN YOU'RE LONELY 
        16  AND SCARED AT THE END OF OUR DAYS.

    III 17  COULD IT BE YOU'RE AFRAID OF WHAT YOU'R
        18  FRIENDS MIGHT SAY 
        19  IF THEY NEW YOU BELIEVED IN GOD ABOVE
        20  THEY SHOULD REALISE BEFORE THE CRITICISE
        21  THAT GOD IS THE ONLY WAY TO LOVE.

    IV  23  IS YOUR MIND SO SMALL THAT YOU HAVE TO FALL
        24 IN WITH THE PACK WHEREVER THEY RUN
        25  WILL YOU STILL SNEER WHEN DEATH IS NEAR
        26  AND SAY THEY MAY AS WELL WORSHIP THE SUN.

    V   27  I THINK IT WAS TRUE IT WAS PEOPLE LIKE YOU
        28  THAT CRUCIFIED CHRIST
        29  I THINK IT IS SAD THE OPINION YOU HADE WAS THE
        30  ONLY ONE VOICED.
        31  WILL YOU BE SO SURE WHEN YOUR DAY IS NEAR
        32  SAY YOU DON'T BELIEVE?
        33  YOU HAD THE CHANCE BUT YOU TURNED IT DOWN
        34  NOW YOU CAN'T RETRIEVE.










    VI  35  PERHAPS YOU'LL THINK BEFORE YOU SAY THAT
        36  GOD IS DEAD AND GONE
        37  OPEN YOUR EYES, JUST REALIZE THAT HE IS THE
        38  ONE.
        39  THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN SAVE YOU KNOW FROM
        40  ALL THIS SIN AND HATE.
        41  OR WILL YOU STILL JEER AT ALL YOU HEAR?
        42  YES!-I THINK IT'S TOO LATE.

    In this piece, the group asserts a belief in an afterlife and spiritual 
redemption.  As grisly as the image of a hanged pontiff is, its shock value is 
a necessary part of the message:  They reject religious dogma, stating that a 
belief in God, in one's own heart, is the only guiding light to help one inn 
his life (lines 11/12, 39/40).  Furthermore, the reject religious hypocrisy 
(lines 5/6, 7/8) and peer pressure (verses III, IV) as excuses for not 
accepting God.  To clarify further:  following the crowd does not justify 
shrugging responsibility for one's own actions.

    After re-reading, it becomes obvious that this song is an ascerbic critique 
of atheism; (line 35/36) I refer here again to verses three and four.  In these 
two verses, the picture painted in one of Godless conformity and how it's 
viewed as being as foolish as Paganism.  These lyrics set an example for the 
listener by relating personal experience (lines 13-16).  However, for those who 
cannot accept this the group has no recourse but to condemn them, although 
rather ironically; they hope that their rhetorical loss of faith in the 
listener will open his eyes (line 42).

            WHAT IS THIS, THAT STANDS BEFORE ME?
            FIGURE IN BLACK, WHICH POINTS AT ME
            TURN ROUND QUICK AND START TO RUN
            FIND OUT I'M THE CHOSEN ONE.  OH, NO!
            
            BIG BLACK SHAPE WITH EYES OF FIRE
            TELLING PEOPLE THEIR DESIRE
            SATAN'S SITTING THERE, HE'S SMILING
            WATCHES THOSE FLAMES GET HIGHER AND HIGHER
            OH, NO, NO, -- PLEASE GOD HELP ME!
            
                IS THIS THE END MY FRIEND?
                SATAN'S COMING 'ROUND THE BEND
                PEOPLE RUNNING 'CAUSE THEY'RE SCARED
                THE PEOPLE BETTER GO AND BEWARE
                NO, NO!  PLEASE--NO!!
                
                
    The all time controversy winner!  Is this not irrefutably  THE song about 
Black Magic in rock?  It's all so obvious, suffuse with evil imagery; Satan, 
walls of flame, figure in black, and damnation at the end.  Yes, I see the 
images too; it definitely concerns Black Magic.  Then again, Shakespeare's 
Macbeth employed scenes of witches involved in conjurations; does that mean 
that Shakespeare was a warlock?  Poe used to write sardonic tragedies about 
twisted murderers and the bizarre nature of acts, did that make him an evil, 
leering, demented killer?  Did either of them advocated what they wrote about?  
One has to remember that writing about something is not necessarily the same as 
emulating it.  Tony Iommi spoke out quite strongly about this:  ""People are 
bringing us down saying that we are a Black Magic group.  I think they must be










getting mixed up with Black Widow.  We don't do any sacrifices on stage, and 
we're not on a black magic kick.  We wanted to do heavy numbers and the guitar 
riffs we worked out were more suited to evil things than love.  We play songs 
about black magic, but they are more likely to be against than for it.""(12)  

    By now, you're probably asking yourself who Black Widow is, right?  Then 
it's time for a little history:

        Sabbath, before they were known as Sabbath, had the same line-up but 
two earlier names.  The first one was Polka Tulk, which seemed sure to doom 
them to obscurity.(13)  The soon realized this and changed the group's name to 
Earth.  Now, Earth was a blues band at the end of the English blues boom.  As 
if that wasn't bad enough, they soon discovered that not only was there another 
group named Earth, but they had also released a single.  To avoid confusion, 
they changed their name again.(14)  But what made them decide on that name?  
Just ask Ozzy:  ""I just liked the name Black Sabbath because of the succession 
of vowel sounds.(15)  If that sounds ludicrous just consider this:  Sabbath was 
""...the first of the really committed, loud and heavy bands...""(16)  They 
needed a name to match the gut-wrenching power they were developing.  Tony knew 
that he wanted Sabbath to be noticed above all the rest of the British blues 
bands:  ""We wanted something of our own that we'd like and people would like.  
And we wanted something loud!""










    Tony didn't hate the blues.  He'd cut his teeth as a guitarist on the likes 
of The Shadows, Buddy Holly and Django Rheinhardt, developing his own style 
from there.  But he realized the group had no future in the blues:

        'We couldn't keep playing 12-bars forever.  We just got fed up with 
Earth music.  It was jazz, blues stuff.  It was good for practice but nothing 
else.'

    In the late 'Sixties, blues groups were a dime a dozen in Birmingham and 
interest was waning in the blues boom due to the glut of groups.  One man, by 
the name of Jim Simpson, had heard Earth around the Birmingham club circuit and 
understood what they were trying to do.  He decided to take them under his 
wing.  With the aid of his massive record collection, Jim expanded the group's 
horizons in the areas of jazz and blues.  He introduced them to artists like 
Wes Montgomery, Count Basie and Jimmy Rushing.  It was from Rushing in 
particular that they derived the repetitive riff style so readily noticeable in 
their later incarnation as Black Sabbath.

    The Count Basie influence is evidenced in the song ""Wicked World"" from the 
first album; Sabbath drummer Bill Ward uses a ""'sighing hi-hat'...in the manner 
of Basie's drummer Jo Jones.""










    The influence is subtle, almost subliminal.  Yet it is one which was not 
thought capable of hard, 'heavy' rock bands in the late 'Sixties.  Although Led 
Zeppelin and Jimi Hendrix also had their work steeped in blues and jazz 
derivations (Hendrix' ""Third Stone From the Sun"" and Zeppelin's version of 
Willie Dixon's ""I Can't Quit You Baby"" from their first album), neither was 
able to match the intense energy of Black Sabbath.  Iommi has always had a 
preference for music with an original, distinct style of its' own; as an 
example, he mentions guitarists Joe Pass and Alvin Lee as two of his strongest 
songwriting influences.

    It would also be necessary that Sabbath develop a unique, distinctive style 
and image of their own.  Though they had changed their name from Earth to Black 
Sabbath to avoid confusion with the other Earth; at the same time another group 
emerged by the name of Black Widow ""...who WERE profoundly influenced by the 
occult, had a male witch as a patron, and wrote pieces like ""Come to The 
Sabbat.""  Unfortunately, Sabbath was constantly reaping the benefits of Widow's 
publicity.

    Sabbath was a group that never minced words.  If they saw something as 
destructive, they would be sure to rub the listener's face it it.  They did not 
want their point to be missed.

    With their straightforward, sometimes brutal way of looking at things, they 
try to shock the listener's conscience back into awareness.  The imagery of 
""Hand of Doom"", from the Paranoid album, is candid and condemning; it is a 
strong statement against drug addiction and rightly so...

            IT'S TO LATE TOO TURN
            YOU DON'T WANNA LEARN
            PRICE OF LIFE YOU CRY
            NOW YOU'RE GONNA DIE
            
            
    Many people felt the group's overall direction was pessimistic and had a 
negative effect on its listener's due to that.  ""Ozzy insisted that if people 
thought he was having a bad effect on the minds of young kids, they should go 
and watch the TV news where real murder and mayhem were a way of life, and 
shown night after night."" (18)

    Sabbath was never negative in their message; they were simply truthful 
about waht they saw as wrong in the world.  If you ""Strip away the horror 
stories, the imagery and the hysteria, (and) turn down the amps a notch...you 
have a well-rehearsed, solid blues and rock band, powered by a dedication to 
well defined objectives.""  On the top of the list of those objectives was 
truth; Sabbath never feared facing that truth squarely, regardless of what many 
people thought of them.

Long, long, time ago,
I can still remember,
When the local calls were ""free"".
And I knew if I paid my bill,
And never wished them any ill,
That the phone company would let me be...

But Uncle Sam said he knew better,
Split 'em up, for all and ever!
We'll foster competition:
It's good capital-ism!

I can't remember if I cried,
When my phone bill first tripled in size.
But something touched me deep inside,
The day... Bell System... died.

And we were singing...

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

Is your office Step by Step,
Or have you gotten some Crossbar yet?
Everybody used to ask...
Oh, is TSPS coming soon?
IDDD will be a boon!
And, I hope to get a Touch-Tone phone, real soon...

The color phones are really neat,
And direct dialing can't be beat!
My area code is ""low"":
The prestige way to go!

Oh, they just raised phone booths to a dime!
Well, I suppose it's about time.
I remember how the payphones chimed,
The day... Bell System... died.

And we were singing...

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

Back then we were all at one rate,
Phone installs didn't cause debate,
About who'd put which wire where...
Installers came right out to you,
No ""phone stores"" with their ballyhoo,
And 411 was free, seemed very fair!

But FCC wanted it seems,
To let others skim long-distance creams,
No matter 'bout the locals,
They're mostly all just yokels!

And so one day it came to pass,
That the great Bell System did collapse,
In rubble now, we all do mass,
The day... Bell System... died.

So bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

I drove on out to Murray Hill,
To see Bell Labs, some time to kill,
But the sign there said the Labs were gone.
I went back to my old CO,
Where I'd had my phone lines, years ago,
But it was empty, dark, and ever so forlorn...

No relays pulsed,
No data crooned,
No MF tones did play their tunes,
There wasn't a word spoken,
All carrier paths were broken...

And so that's how it all occurred,
Microwave horns just nests for birds,
Everything became so absurd,
The day... Bell System... died.

So bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

We were singing:

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
                             *                          

                   THE REAL OLD TIME RELIGION
                   tune: ""Old Time Religion""

       (Chorus): Give me that real old time religion (3X)
                 It's good enough for me!

We will have a mighty orgy        We will sacrifice to Yuggoth
in the honour of Astarte          we will sacrifice to Yuggoth
it'll be a mighty party           Burn a candle for Yog-Soggoth
and it's good enough for me!      and the Goat With a Thousand Young!

We will all be saved by Mithras       If your rising sign is Aries
We will all be saved by Mithras       You'll be taken by the Fairies
slay the Bull and play the zithras    Meet the Buddah in Benares
on that Resurrection Day!             where he'll hit you with a pie!

I hear Valkyries a-comin                There are people into Voodoo

As the goddess Kali dances           Oh the ancient goddess Nerthus

And that's good enough for me!       But she's good enough for me!

It was good enough for Venus           We will sing our staves to Venus
She'd have sighed if she'd of seen us  We will sing our staves to Venus

And she's good enough for me!          But it's good enough for me!

                                             IMPERIUM COMPOUND    
                                             (Atenveldt Verses)

   Now here's a story, a little bit gory,
   A little bit happy, a little bit sad.
   About a drink called Imperium Compound
   And how the SCA's been had!                       

   Chorus: Oh we think, we think, we think,
           The King is a fink, a fink, a fink,
           A figure of respectability
           Rules the Kingdom thru Imperium Compound
           The results are plain to see!

   Mongol Hordemen, those free-living swordsmen
   Subverting the Kingdoms from underneath!
   Have no use for Imperium Compound
   Except perhaps to brush their teeth!

   AltChorus: Oh we fink, we fink, we fink,
              The Khan and the Kink, the Kink, the Kink,
              And the Board, their Great Senilities!
              The Western Irgun, drinks Imperium Compound
              And we're BACK, with results you'll see!    

   Lady Laurel, with Authority Royal,
   Passes and rejects our heraldry
   She needs a swig of Imperium Compound
   Then perhaps she'd deign to talk to me!            

   Lady Trude thought it her duty
   To turn a social wrong into a Right
   Proved her point with Imperium Compound
   And showed that Cheshire Cats can fight!  //and scratch//

   The Board of Directors styled themselves The Electors
   And another con they tried to swing
   Now the BoD drinks Imperium Compound
   So we no longer need a King!                        

   AltChorus: Oh the Bod, the BoD, the BoD,
              It thinks it is God, is God, is God,
              The figure of Supreme Authority!
              And if we O.D.'d on Imperium Compund
              there'd be no need for Royalty!          

   Oh, MEDIEVAL Net, we thought it was all wet
   With witty remarks, and other kinds of sass
   We'll feed our computers on Imperium Compound
   And BYTE the BoD right on its' righteous ass!         

   Good old Duncan was often drunken
   Chasing all the ladies fair
   He bathed himself in Imperium Compound
   Now he has a little savoir faire!                     

                    (more)


  ATEN IMPERIUM (cont.)

   Ioseph of Locksley, never changes his socks, he
   Runs around looking like a Cavalier,
   He stocked up on Imperium Compound
   And he has enough to last for years and years!        

   AltChorus: Oh they forgot, forgot, forgot
              The Locks-e-ly Plot, the Plot, the Plot!
              And it works the best when it is underground!
              It isn't a hassle for a green-and-white tassle
              They're the ones that BREW Imperium Compound!  

   Trelon of the Wood, he was very good, he
   Was a leader that had never been beat before;
   But Caid had Imperium Compound,
   And Imperial Roman Caid won the War!  //with help!//   

   In Tyr Ysgithr, it's regularly whispered there
   That the Kingdom is ruled over by a King    // What's THAT? //
   They're ""democratic"" and quite erratic....
   They've forgot the purpose of the whole damn thing!     

   King Sir Mark von, with his pretty white suit on,
   Rules the Kingdom both with Grace and Purity!
   He never touches Imperium Compound
   At least not where anyone else can see!               

   Duke Sir Deaton, was never beaten
   On the field, or in the drinking hall;
   At the Catbox War with Caid,
   Left thirty bodies piled against the wall!             

   Denis O'Titans was good at smitin'
   A Locksley Monster in every single way!
   Drank a little Imperium Compound
   And ATE Deaton's sword that day  // No! REALLY! //

                          WTP-0002C

        Last night I had the strangest dream in this bleak century
        I dreamed that people the world around believed in Chivalry

        I dreamed I saw a Kingly Crown enshrined in laurel leaves
        with Grace and Joy and Purity attendant at his feet

        I dreamed I saw the perfect Knight receive his accolade
        and minstrels sang and children laughed in some soft forest glade

        I dreamed I saw the finest thing that ever man could make
        grow great and strong and undefiled: Pray God I never wake!

        Last night I had the strangest dream in this bleak century
        I dreamed that people the world around believed in Chivalry

               (to the tune of ""Good King Wenceslaus"")

                Locksley Monsters never yield
                on the field of battle
                strike the helm and bash the shield
                make their eyeteeth rattle
                Bodies on the ground will lie
                bones will burst in sunder
                search for Locksleys' enemies:

            There is a man who we know well that does the best he can
            but he's displayed in armour made of reticulated garbage cans!

            He looks so fine and fair and strong, oh how he plays the man
            and how it's prized, those galvanized, reticulated garbage cans

            The noblest Roman of them all, a good Praetorian
            a combatant who wears no pants, judst reticulated garbage cans!

            Like old Horatius at the Bridge, like the Legions of Valerian
            (O dearie me: those LOVELY knees!)
            and those reticulated garbage cans!

         (sung to the tune (obviously) of the 12 Days of Christmas)


1.           The first time I sent my device, The Heralds said to me

            ""It violates the Rule of Three""

2.           The next time I tried it, the Heralds said to me

            ""We changed the forms, and it violates the Rule of
             Three"".

3.           The third time I tried, and the Heralds said to me, 

            ""We upped the fees, we changed the forms, and it
             violates the Rule of Three"".

4.           Another time I tried and the Heralds said to me,
 
            ""We haven't got it, we upped the fees, we changed the 
             forms, and it violates the Rule of Three"".

5.           The fifth time I tried it, the Heralds said to me,  

            ""In a decision rendered by the College of Arms on
             August 1st, A.S. V it was decided that this style of
             heraldic design was not appropriate to the aims and 
             intentions of the Corporate Body. Holy! Holy! Holy! ""

 note: verse 5 is delivered in an extremely fast, mono-
       tone, similiar to a Gregorian Chant.

           "" ....we haven't got it, we upped the fees, we changed the forms,
             and it violates the Rule of Three.""

6.           I tried it a sixth time, and the Heralds said to me,

            ""We changed the rules, &c""

7.           A seventh time I tried and, the Heralds said to me,

            ""It's against the Rule of Tincture, we changed the
             rules, &c""

8.           I tried it once again and the heralds said to me,

            ""It's not a Period design, It's against the Rule of Tincture, We
             changed the rules, &c""

                                * more *



    Heralds Said To Me (cont.)

9.           I sent it in once more, and the Heralds said to me,

            ""We changed the rules again, It's not a Period design,
             it's against the Rule of Tincture, we changed the
             rules, &c""

10. (sung in cold anger)
             The LAST time I sent my device, the Heralds said to me

    (sung in a state of SMUG)
             ""Someone else has got it, &c""




              (nb: every single one of these reasons has been used by the
              CoA, at one point or another, to reject perfectly good
              heraldry, along with some even MORE stupid.  If the shoe 
              fits....................!!!!!!!!)

           or: Who was that Vermin I saw you with last, Knight?
   or: There may be Lice on all you Knice, but there ain't no Lice on me

           Once there was a Barony howling in the wilderness
           nestled in the Valley where the River doesn't flow
           and the folks were driven buggy by the insects in the Revel Hall
           Authenticity is wonderful, but this doesn't go!

                   Bugs on the Baroness, bugs on the Baroness!
                   That was the cry that you heard all the day
                   and the scratching can be heard from Ysgithr to Ered Sul
                   why did we come here? Let's go away!

           See them all a scratching, nestled in their armour tight
           the fleas have a melee team that's challenging the field!
           call Truly Nolen! Someone's gotta help us out!
           the crabs are nesting in our helms but we'll never yield!

                   (chorus)

           Dawn comes a-breaking, the bugs have won the Coronet...
           flea-infested Conan-clones in piles upon the lawn
           where is the Barony? The bugs have eaten everyone...
           termites got the stick-jocks, and all their sticks are gone!

                   (chorus)

                  For oft I thought of mighty men
                  who carved a Land with sword and pen
                  and lit a candle, burning bright,
                  that pierced the darkness; stirred the night!

                  So raise your banners, blazoned bright
                  Advance the Dream and Shine the Light!
                  in battle's crash and Revel's song

      What the use of wearing panties
      whalebone corsets of your Auntie's
      boxer shorts and other scanties
      best of all is nude
      there's such fun in going bra-less
      now that it's no longer lawless
      'specially if your figure's flawless
      best of all is nude
      nude is what you're born in
      shirts are never torn in
      underwear and lacy flimsies, garter belts and other whimsies
      yards of itchy cloth to put your form in
      ducks all do it, maidens rue it
      even ancient Picts in Britain blue it
      going naked's how to do it
      best of all is nude!

      If your garters aren't elastic
      tie them up in knots fantastic
      (panty hose is something drastic!)
      best of all is nude!
      If you're tired of wearing clotheses
      shed your garment 'mongst the roses
      never mind the old bluenoses
      best of all is nude!
      Nude is best for ducking!
      Worst for horses bucking!
      Moonlit nights will see such sights
          that are very best for fooling round
                              .....and elbows!
      Nudity is grand to see
       a well-known antidote to virginity
      take your clothes off and you'll see:
      best of all is nude!

                   once I talked to a great Grey Man
                   spun three times and said with a sigh
                   hadn't been for the Runes had his other eye!

                   prettiest thing I've ever seen
                   she went down underneath the hill
                   and came back out of her own free will

                   Brian Boru, on Irish ground
                   walked three times the Island round
                   Norsemen came lookin for a fight
                   just another Irish Saturday night!

                   Hi said Lugh on the banquest night
                   a poet and a player and a good wheelwright
                   a harper and a warrior and none the least:
                   a Druid and he got in to the Feast!

                   Harold Haardrada's face was red!

                   got six feet of English ground

                   the Legion with it's Eagles bright
                   marched into the Pictish night
                   met them there upon the sand
                   gave em up to the Wicker Man!

                   eight-legged steed and hound of Hel
                   the one-eyed Man, he loves ya well

                   are you then feared of the dark?

                   The Circle forms, the Circle flows
                   the Circle goes where no man knows
                   Hail to the Lady, one in three:
                   Present is Past and Past is Me!

                   Rhiannon's Birds are still in flight

                                  spread their seeds thruout the Land

                                  saw the Lady where she stood
                                  by the fire burning bright
                                  came to know his heart's delight!

                    WEAPONS AT THE DOOR

 Being a Polemic concerning the alleged Custom of the West Kingdom concerning 
 checking your Weapons at the Door of the Revel Hall. As the Satire is the 
 Weapon of the Bard, this said Polemic is to be checked at the Door, along with 
 swords, knives, redheaded Ladies and other such Deadly Things.....

         As I roved out to Western Lands to take the Western Air
         I went into a Revel Hall and I saw a Twelfth Night there
         but I was halted at the gate by a Privy Consellor
                 (that's the man who tells the King of the West how to go to
                  the bath room!)
         who told me I would have to check my Weapons at the door

         As I, in my astonishment, stood hung on tenter-pegs
         a Knight came in whose Prouess hung down between his legs
         the Doorman grabbed a greatsword and he struck the Knight full sore
         and gave him a reciept; he left his weapon at the door!

         a Bard was next whose goodly Voice has entertained us all
         but he, too, was prevented from entering the Hall
         and told he could not carry deadly weapons on the floor
         he left his Voice and Harp among the weapons at the door

         a Master entered graciously, a man we all know well
         who holds a 3rd Dan Black Belt, tho this he'd never tell
         the Master struggled valiantly, the Master cursed and swore
         but he left his hands, and feet, as weapons at the door

         the company was jovial, altho a bit dismayed
         for lack of proper cutlery, down to the smallest blade
         for even teeth and fingernails, each can be used in War
         were cut, and pulled, and left behind, as weapons at the door!

         And has their King not loyal Knights that He must be afraid
         of brawling in his Hall and of Assassin's bloody blade?
         the Rights of Men to carry Arms at least WE'VE not foreswore
         and a POX on them that made the Rule of Weapons at the Door!

                           THE STREETS OF ANN ARBOR

               As I walked out thru the streets of Ann Arbor
               as I walked out thru Ann Arbor one day
               I spied a young Mongol all dressed in white linen
               all dressed in white linen and cold as the clay

               I then spied another, done in on the sidewalk
               along with just about six dozen more
               their wounds were all gaping, from mace and from braoadsword
               from claymore and cannon, all dripping with gore

               what caused this grave carnage, I cried to the Monglos
               oh pray what's the reason for this awful sight
               my answer came slowly from under the corpse-pile
               ""It seems that our bark is much worse than our bite.....""

               the answer continued from pale lips a-shaking
               we sang all our songs and believed them as true
               the Dark Horde could never be beaten in battle
               we thought this was what all good Mongols could do...

               we went down to Atenveldt all for to plunder
               ""too large to defend"" was our song every night
               but Atenveldt's different from East, West or Middle
               there, even the bushes have learned how to bite!

               the Clann stole our ponies, the Scraelings our foodstuffs
               we ran into axes in AtenViking hands
               our maidens ran off with one Richard of Arkham
               and we're all that's left to return to our lands

               MacChluarains and Monsters, Lockehaven and Foxmoor
               that Kingdom is BIG and its' fighters are MEAN!
               we fought and we lost, and fled back to Ann Arbor
               we all came back home with results that you've seen

               keep away from that Land with its' cactus and marshes
               it's no place for Mongols who are bent on War
               they count their blows well, but they strick them yet better
               he crawled into his Yurt, and fell, dead, on the floor.....

                       SONG OF THE THREE
             copyright 1981 W. J. Bethancourt III
                            C. A. Bethancourt III
       tune: the song of the Cowardly Lion, Tin Woodsman and Scarecrow
             in the movie version of the Wizard of Oz

        (Enter the Scarecrow, who singeth:)

        My wife is always nagging; my Prowess it is lagging
        I can't do anything
        she has got a reason, but revenge is out of season
        Oh I wish I could be King!

        If I just had the Crown on, I'd always have a frown on
        and the Barons on a string
        Heads they would be rolling, the Board would be cajoling
        Oh if only I was King!

        I am very fed up with the way this group is set up
        Oh I'd change everything!
        they are so high and mighty with the way that they do fight-ey
        Oh, someday I'll be King!

        Tho my wife is melancholic, and very...vitriolic
        she's a wasp without a sting!
        I'd have to supervise her with a pack of tranquilizers
        If I only was a King......

        (the Tin Woodsman joineth him, and singeth:)

        I grew up kind of cocky, and rather big, and stocky
        and straight as any rod
        on the field I'm a battallion, with the Ladies I'm a stallion
        ...Oh they'd better make me God!

        The other boys are jealous they say I'm over-zealous
        they'd do better to applaud
        the things that I am giving to this Dream that we are living
        oh I wish they'd make me God!

        They say that I'm conceited, but I'm just badly treated
        by people and by BoD
        just think of what they're missing by My Majesty dismissing
        Oh they'd better make me God!

        (the Cowardly Lion creepeth forth, and singeth:)

        Oh I could be a fighter, a great and mighty smiter
        and be the perfect knight
        it's a great and nasty shame, and everyone's to blame
        oh I wish that I could fight!

        Song of the Three (cont.)

        I could be a Cavalier drinking wine and ale and beer
        and be a gorgeous sight
        but it would cost me too much money so it isn't very funny
        oh I wish that I could fight!                               

        Let me at 'em on the field, I would surely make them yield
        to my Power and my Might
        with rattan, shinai and rapier they would nevermore escape here
        If they'd only let me fight

        (all doeth the Softe Shoe off, stage left)

                She was afraid to come out to the Tourney
                She was worried that ""something might show..""
                She was afraid to come out to the Tourney
                And the poor thing did NOT want to go...

                  (2 - 3 - 4, tell the people what she wore!)

                  It was an itsy bitsy teeny weenie little rabbit fur bikini

                  An itsy bitsy teenie weenie little rabbit fur bikini
                  And in her apartment she wanted to stay!

                One day in the Kingdom of the Middle
                It happened at a Tourney one day:
                The Mongols invaded the Middle
                But the Middle did not want to play...

                  (eins - zwei - drei, but the Dark Horde wouldn't die!)

                  It was an itsy bitsy tiny teenie Nauseating Mongol weenie

          Some folks call me many names, others call me crazy
          Tom O'Bedlam's son am I, for my mind is hazy!
          I'd rather sing a song than work (if it's not too phrasey!)
          Lengthy rhymes don't bother me....truth to tell: I'm lazy!

          Yang, your yurt is very nice, and your Horde is smelly,
          And I'm sure that yak-meat will nicely fill one's belly!
          But remember this one line, or you're not worth jelly:
          FIRST you plunder, THEN you burn! That's how to be rakehelly!

          My Lady Lorelei your eyes do drive me to distraction
          And the lovely Care-Cheri causes....petrifaction!
          But I, and they, quite taken are, so I can't take action...
          Therefore, Ladies, fill my cup; I'll drink to stupefaction!

          Now Atenveldt your fighters, all, are most good and gentle
          And the Ladies, bless 'em all, are most ornamental!
          But that little Nikki-Toad....has me sentimental
          Though with boffer in her hand she is argumental!

          This stupid little song, m'lords, is mostly sung in Latin
          By the Goliards, of course, from vespers clear to matins!
          But I prefer a coarser cloth over silk or satins
          English is more understood, mine enemies to flatten!

          Good People all, I've made my Song, its' music's well-recited
          But my voice could use some work; the flowers it has blighted!
          It's rude and rusty, grim and bad, and squeaky like a door-hinge,
          But I'm a better Bard than you: I found a rhyme for ""orange!""

                      by William Poundstone
                              1983

     Two mentalities are at work here: 1960s rock fans and 1980s
fundamentalist Christians. The idea of phonographically concealed
messages dates from the Paul McCartney death scare of 1969. For
hard-core types, the secret-message rumors never really died. Avid
rock fans have auditioned ever album release since the late 1960s
for hidden nuances. Backward messages, barely audible messages,
and messages on one stereo track only have been alleged. At the
other end of the sociosensual spectrum, fundamentalist Christians
have gotten into the act. TV programs such as PRAISE THE LORD and
THE 700 CLUB have propagated rumors of a satanic plot in the
recording industry, no less, in which various albums conceal
""backward-masked"" demonic murmurings. If THAT sounds too spacey to
be taken seriously, consider that it was the fundamentalist groups
who were behind House Resolution 6363, a bill introduced in the
U.S. House of Representatives by Robert K. Dornan (R., Calif.) in
1982 to label all suspect records: ""WARNING: THIS RECORD CONTAINS
BACKWARD MASKING THAT MAKES A VERBAL STATEMENT WHICH IS AUDIBLE
WHEN THIS RECORD IS PLAYED BACKWARD AND WHICH MAY BE PERCEPTIBLE
AT A SUBLIMINAL LEVEL WHEN THIS RECORD IS PLAYED FORWARD."" In
February 1983, the Arkansas State Senate passed a similar record-
labeling bill by a vote of 86 to 0.
     Contributing to the quasi-occult status of these rumors is
the difficulty of checking them out on home audio equipment. You
pretty much have to take someone else's word for it, or dismiss
the rumors out of hand.
     From a technical standpoint, there are four simple ways to
conceal a verbal message on a recording. The most obvious is to
record the message at a very low volume. The message may then be
recovered by turning the volume up while playing the record or
tape. If the message is faint enough, though, noise levels of home
equipment may garble it. If the accompanying music or lyrics are
loud enough, or if the message itself is indistinct or
electronically modified, it may be hard to hear on any equipment.
     A second gimmick is to record a message on one stereo track
only. Records and tapes have two independent recordings, of
course, normally played simultaneously for stereo effect. On a
record, each stereo track occupies on one side of the V-shaped
groove for the needle. On a tape, the tracks are recorded in
parallel lanes of the magnetic material. The two tracks are called
""right"" and ""left"" after the stereo speakers they will play on.
Otherwise, the tracks are interchangeable -- the sound mixer can
put anything he or she wants on each track. A message on one track
can be masked by simultaneous loud music or lyrics on the opposite
track. With normal stereo balance (or mono equipment) the loud
track drowns out the message track. At home, single-track messages
can be recovered by adjusting the stereo balance so that only the
desired track plays. Sometimes this trick also makes indistinct
words clearer. Even if the words are not exclusively on one track,
they may happen to be more audible on one track.
     A message could be recorded at a speed different from the
rest of the record. Then the record would have to be played faster
or slower than usual to recover the message. Unless the message
was at one of the standard speeds (say, 45 rpm on a 33 1/3 rpm
record), it could not be played normally on home equipment.
     The fourth and most commonly alleged trick is to record a
verbal message backward. Reversed speech has several unexpected
features. One is that syllables are not a constant in the reversal
process. A one-syllable word can have two or three syllables when
played backward. Thus ""number nine"" in the Beatles' REVOLUTION 9
reverses to ""Turn me on, dead man"" (or something like it), a jump
from three to five syllables.
     There is no simple way to predict what a word or phrase will
sound like reversed. Obviously, you can't just reverse the
letters.
     Reversed messages are difficult to recover at home. Record
turntables are not built to go backwards. Some have a neutral
setting, in which the pickup and amplifier remain active and you
can turn the record backward by hand. But hardly anyone has a
stead enough hand to produce satisfactory results.
     With patience, it is possible to reverse a cassette
recording. Transfer the music from the original record or tape
onto a blank tape cassette. Place the cassette flat on a table.
Draw our the part of the tape with the suspected message and snip
it off at both ends. Hold the tape segment horizontally. Rotate it
180 degrees, keep it horizontal at all times. This turns the tape
end for end. Splice the reversed tape segment back onto the two
loose ends of the cassette with strong adhesive tape. Reel the
tape back inside the cassette. The sliced segment will play
backward on an ordinary cassette player.
     I rented a recording studio to test the secret-message
rumors. New copiies of the records in question were transcribed on
a quarter-inch master tape. Where rumor alleged that a single
stereo track contained a message, right and left stereo tracks
were transcribed separately. Records with alleged inaudible
messages were treated similarly. To test claims of reversed
messages, recordings on the master tape were edited out and
spliced in backward. Twenty cuts or portions of cuts from sixteen
albums were tested.


""Another One Bites the Dust""
Queen, THE GAME

Rumor: When played backward, the lyrics say, ""It's fun to smoke
marijuana.""
Findings: There is something that sounds like ""It's fun to smoke
marijuana"" in the reversed music. It is repeated over and over. It
might be rendered no less faithfully, however, as ""sfun to scout
mare wanna."" This ""message"" is the reversal of the song title,
which is repeated as a line in the song.
     Let's make a distinction between engineered and phonetic
reversals. When an artist records a verbal statement, reverses it
by turning the tape end for end, mixes the reversed statement onto
a master tape, and has records and tapes produced from the master,
that is an engineered reversal. When the phonetic properties of
song lyrics are such that they can be reversed to sound like
something else, that is a phonetic reversal.
     ""It's fun to smoke marijuna"" is clearly a phonetic reversal.
The lyrics are perfectly plain played forward (""Another one bites
the dust""), no so plain played backward (""sfun to scout mare
wanna""). With an engineered reversal, the opposite should hold
true: gibberish forward, clear as a bell backward. Some are
prepared to believe that phonetic reversals are just as
intentional as engineered reversals -- that the songwriter
painstakinginly planned the phonetic double-entendre. In the
absence of confirming evidence, that just doesn't wash. It's too
easy to find coincidences. If, for example, the letters of the
alphabet are recited in conventional fashion (Ay, Bee, Cee, etc.)
and reversed, at least five sound like English language words. D
reverses to ""eden,"" F becomes ""pray,"" S becomes ""say,"" V becomes
""even,"" and Z becomes ""easy."" ""It's fun to smoke marijuana"" is
likewise a coincidence.


""A Child is Coming""
Jefferson Starship, BLOWS AGAINST THE EMPIRE

Rumor: When played backward, ""son of Satan.""
Findings: Another phonetic coincidence. The repeated ""It's getting
better"" reverses to an iffy ""son of Satan,"" the ""of"" drawn out and
the ""Satan"" strongly accented on the first syllable.


""Eldorado""
Electric Light Orchestra, ELDORADO

Rumor: When played backward, ""He is the nasty one/ Christ, you're
infernal/ It is said we're dead men/ Everyone who has the mark
will live.""
Findings: Coincidence. The supposed message lurks around the line
""On a voyage of no return to see."" Reversed, this passage becomes
the expected syllable salad -- no one hearing it would describe it
as anything but reversed music. Only if you listen while reading
along with what you're supposed to hear will you get anything. The
rumored version of the message is somewhat fudged. The passage
sounds more like ""He's to nasty one/ Christ you are, Christ,
you're fernal/ There wiss uh, we're dead men..."" There is no ""in""
in what is taken to be ""infernal."" The line that is supposed to be
""Everyone who has the mark will live"" isn't even close, though the
syllable count is right.


""Shoo Be Doo""
The Cars, CANDY-O

Rumor: When played backward, the word ""Satan"" repeated
approximately eleven times.
Findings: Coincidence. The rumor refers to the reversal of the ""Shoo
be doo, shoo be doo, shoo be doo..."" near the end of the song. Given
the mysterious logic of reversed phonemes, these three-syllable units
can be hard as a repeated two-syllable word. The word sounds a little
like ""Satan.""


""Snowblind""
Styx, PARADISE THEATER

Rumor: According to a mimeographed list of suspect records distributed
by Congressman Dornan, the words ""Satan move through our voices"" when
played backwards.
Findings: Negative. Despite repeated listenings, it was not even
possible to identify the part of the reversed track that Dornan et al.
are talking about.


""Stairway to Heaven""
Led Zeppelin, untitled, a.k.a. STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN

Rumor: In reverse, ""I live for Satan... The Lord turns me off...
There's no escaping it... Here's to my sweet Satan... There's power in
Satan... He will give you 666.""
Findings: Coincidence. If you listen very carefully to the ""And it
makes me wonder"" lines in reverse, you'll hear something approaching
""There's no escaping it."" A better description is ""There's no escape
do."" Knock of the last syllable, and you have ""There's no escape,"" a
complete, intelligible sentence in reverse. It's there, all right, but
it's not an unlikely enough coincidence to -- well, make you wonder.
      The ""Satan"" in ""I live for Satan"" is good and clear. The ""I live
for"" part isn't. The other alleged lines are unremarkable. All are
phonetic reversals of the entirely lucid forward lyrics and obviously
just accidents.


""When Electricity Came to Arkansas""
Black Oak Arkansas, BLACK OAK ARKANSAS and RONCH AND ROLL

Rumor: In reverse, ""Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan. He is God. He
is God.""
Findings: The BLACK OAK ARKANSAS cut was reversed. Again, pairs of
reversed syllables are being freely interpreted as ""Satan."" ""He is
God"" was not identifiable.


""Rain""
The Beatles, HEY JUDE

Rumor: Unintelligible lyrics at the end are reversed.
Findings: A true engineered reversal and not really a secret. ""Rain""
seems to have been the first popular recording to incorporate an
obviously reversed lyric. The story is that John Lennon accidentally
spliced the last part of the song in backward and liked the effect.
When reversed, the strange-sounding vocals at the end become
intelligible as a reprise starting with the drawn-out word
""sunshine.""
      The reversal is less apparent to the casual listener than it
might be because the accompanying music is not reversed. The ending
fits in smoothly with the rest of the song, the vocals suggesting a
foreign language.


""Fire on High""
Electric Light Orchestra, FACE THE MUSIC

Rumor: When played backward, ""The music is reversible, but time --
turn back!""
Findings: ""Fire on High"" is instrumental. About twenty-six seconds
into the music, scrambled speech is heard. It is mostly louder than
the accompanying music and begins with a two-syllable unit repeated
several times. The seeming speech lasts for about fourteen seconds.
      Reversing the music confirms that there is a true, engineered
message. In reverse, a voice (Jeff Lynne's?) says, ""The music is
reversible, but time -- turn back! Turn back! Turn back! Turn back!""
All the words are clear and unambiguous. Anyone comparing this to the
alleged reversal on ELO's ""Eldorado"" will have no trouble telling
which is genuine.


""Goodbye Blue Sky""
Pink Floyd, THE WALL

Rumor: In reverse, ""You have discovered the secret message.""
Findings: The ""secret message"" is at the very end of the instrumental
passage following the ""Goodbye Blue Sky"" vocals. It comes just before
the words ""What shall we do"" at the start of the song that is
identified as ""Empty Spaces"" on the record label and as ""What shall we
do now?"" on the record sleeve. Played forward, the message is less
apparent than the FACE THE MUSIC reversal: A reasonably attentive
listener might play THE WALL through and not catch it. It suggests
speech not quite close enough to be overheard. In context this is not
unusual because the ""Goodbye Blue Sky"" instrumental passage includes
""airport noises"" and other sound effects. A loud climax in the music
further masks the unintelligible voice.
      When played backward, the voice (Roger Waters?) plainly intones,
""Congratulations, you have just discovered the secret message. Please
send your answer to old Pink, care of the funny farm..."" As the voice
fades out, there may be another word -- perhaps ""Chalfonte or
""Chelsea"" -- after ""funny farm.""


""Heavy Metal Poisoning""
Styx, KILROY WAS HERE

Rumor: A red sticker on the KILROY WAS HERE cover warns, ""By order of
the Majority for Musical Morality, this album contains secret backward
messages...""
Findings: This is a case of second-generation backward-masking. Styx'
PARADISE THEATER did not contain a backward message, though a lot of
people said it did. So Styx has included a sure enough backward
message on KILROY WAS HERE. It is at the very beginning of ""Heavy
Metal Poisoning."" The reversed speech last about three seconds. There
is no musical background. The words reverse to ""Annuit coeptis. Novus
ordo seclorum."" This is the Latin motto encircling the pyramid on the
back of a dollar bill. The usual translation: ""God has favored our
undertakings. A new order of the ages.""
      The cover sticker's ""Majority for Musical Morality"" is a
fictitious Falwellesque group in the KILROY WAS HERE video. Although
the sticker suggests a plurality of ""messages,"" only one was found.


Space between ""I'm So Tired"" and ""Blackbird""
The Beatles, untitled, a.k.a. THE WHITE ALBUM

Rumor: A reversed message. At the time of the Paul-is-dead stories,
the segue from ""I'm So Tired"" to ""Blackbird"" was offered as evidence.
It was held to contain John Lennon's voice, reveresed, saying ""Paul is
dead, miss him, miss him, miss him."" That interpretation seems
unlikely now, but there is a mysterious low muttering between the
songs.
Findings: The mumbling is actually just to the ""I'm So Tired"" side of
the shiny ""space"" between cuts on the record. Each of the stereo
tracks was recorded separately, twice, and a copy of each track was
reversed. This produced four versions of the two-second passage: right
forward, left forward, right reversed, and left reversed. All were
equally unintelligible. It was not even apparent whether the voice is
forward or reversed. Nor could John Lennon be identified as the
speaker. There are nine or ten syllables. The first six (when played
forward) are a two-syllable unit repeated three times. There is little
or no difference betwen the stereo tracks. Any claimed interpretation
of the sounds seems doubtful.


""Strawberry Fields Forever""
The Beatles, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR

Rumor: It was, of course, claimed that John Lennon says ""I buried
Paul"" at the end. (It's forward, at the very end after the music
fades to complete silence, returns, and starts to fade out again.)
But Lennon told ROLLING STONE that the words are ""cranberry
sauce.""
Findings: They are ""cranberry sauce."" The ""sauce""/""Paul"" part is
indistinct, but the first syllable sounds a lot more like ""cran""
than ""I.""


""Baby You're a Rich Man""
The Beatles, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR

Rumor: On one of the tracks the line ""Baby you're a rich man too""
is sung as ""Baby you're a rich fag Jew,"" a dig at Brian Epstein.
Or some think it's ""rich fat Jew"" and claim it as evidence of
Beatle anti-Semitism.
Findings: Negative. The two stereo tracks are nearly identical.
It's always possible to hear words as similar-sounding words, but
basically, the lyrics jibe with the published version.


""Revolution 9""
The Beatles, untitled, a.k.a. THE WHITE ALBUM

Rumor: Various reversed and/or one-track speech. The reversal of
""Number nine"" to ""Turn me on, dead man"" has pretty much been
discounted as coincidence (though it appears on Congressman
Dornan's list).
Findings: Distinction between lyrics and any hidden message blurs
on ""Revolution 9."" The eight-minute cut is a montage of sounds
collected by John Lennon and Yoko Ono. It includes discordant
music, radio broadcasts, sirens, applause, gunfights, sports
cheers, the crackling of a fire, screams, a baby gurgling, a choir
singing, and much that cannot be identified. For this
investigation, ""Revolution 9"" was transcribed four times, twice on
each stereo channel. One copy of each of the tracks was reversed.
The four resulting versions were compared with each other and
against the original two-channel version.
     ""Revolution 9"" contains a lot of talking. Played in stereo,
forward, the longest stretch of understandable speech is probably
an announcer saying, ""...every one of them knew that as time went
by they'd get a little bit older and a little bit slower...""
     One believable instance of reversed speech occurs: someone
saying ""Let me out! Let me out!"" (once held to represent McCartney
in his totaled Aston-Martin). Two iffy reversals occur on the
backward recording of the right stereo track:""She used to be
assistant"" and ""There were two men..."" Neither is clear enough or
long enough to be convincing. Some of the music, including the
recurring theme, sounds more natural in reverse.
     ""Turn me on, dead man"" is a typical phonetic reversal. The
forward ""number nine"" (repeated throughout the cut) is clear; the
reversal is slurred -- something like ""turn me on dedmun."" It has
been claimed that ""number nine"" must be pronounced with a British
accent or with some careful inflection in order to reverse to
""Turn me on, dead man."" This seems not to be so. As an experiment,
three American-accent renderings of ""number nine"" were reversed.
All sound about as much like ""Turn me on, dead man"" as the record
did. Like the other phonetic reversals, ""Turn me on, dead man""
must be considered a coincidence.
     Much of ""Revolution 9"" is on one stereo track only. Near the
end a voice says ""A fine natural imbalance...the Watusi...the
twist...Eldorado...Eldorado."" ""A fine natural imbalance"" is on the
right track only, though the words that follow are in stereo. One
of the longer bits of speech -- ""Who could tell what he was
saying? His voice was low and his [unintelligible] was high and
his eyes were low"" -- is clear on the left track, a bare whisper
on the right.
     There is a stereophonically concealed ""secret message"" on
""Revolution 9."" The words are on the right track. They begin about
four minutes, fifty-eight seconds into the cut and run for about
twenty-two seconds. They are not likely to be noticed in stereo
because of the much louder left track. The sound of applause
begins on the left track at about five minutes, one second into
the cut. Deafening noises -- the clapping, sirens, music --
continue on the left track until five minutes, forty seconds. It
may or may not have been Lennon's and Ono's intention to conceal
the spoken passage. Given the haphazard quality of ""Revolution 9,""
the concealment may have been accidental. To recover the passage,
the left track must be switched off. The right track can then be
heard to contain a sound like a stopwatch ticking, behind these
words:

     So the wife called, and we better go to see a
     surgeon....[A SCREAM MUFFLES A LINE THAT SOUNDS LIKE
     Well, what with the prices, the prices have snowballed,
     no wonder it's closed.] ...So any and all, we went to
     see the dentist instead, who gave him a pair of teeth,
     which wasn't any good at all. So instead of that he
     joined the bloody navy and went to sea.
                      by William Poundstone
                              1986

     There really are backward messages on rock albums. And the
controversy over ""backward masking"" and ""porn rock"" has inspired a
whole new spate of messages. There may have been more genuine
backward messages in the past few years than ever before.
     The backward message controversy is usually traced to the
1960s and John Lennon's avant-garde sound mixing on such tracks as
""Revolution 9"" on the Beatles' WHITE ALBUM. Lennon probably wasn't
trying to conceal a message so much as create an interesting
sound.
     The matter might have ended right there had it not been for
the Paul McCartney death rumor. College kids tried playing Beatles
records forward, backward, and at various speeds to find ""clues""
to McCartney's fate. In the process they found snippets of speech
from Lennon's experiments. Even after McCartney was found safe and
sound in Scotland, some listeners continued to look for hidden
messages.
     Somehow, fundamentalist Christian groups became convinced
(ca. 1982) that the alleged messages were commercials for devil
worship. Not a single indisputable satanic message has turned up,
but there were scattered attempts to ban or label certain albums.
In 1986 one fundamentalist group announced that the theme song for
the old MR. ED TV show contains the word ""Satan"" when played
backward.)
     Ironically, the publicity accorded nonexistent messages has
inspired several artists -- among them porn rock hearing witness
Frank Zappa -- to hide real background messages in their music.
It's easy to do.
     The performer speaks or sings the message normally, then
reverses the tape, which is mixed into the soundtrack. This is all
accomplished simply enough at any recording studio.
     What's not so simple is playing it back. More home record,
cassette, and compact disk players won't play backward. You can
turn a record backward with a pencil eraser, but it's not good for
the needle or the turntable. The only way to reproduce the message
with full fidelity is to use a professional-quality reel-to-reel
tape player and splice the tape in backward.
     We used the facilities of KLOS radio in Los Angeles to
reverse some recent records containing true backward messages.


""Secret Messages""
Electric Light Orchestra, SECRET MESSAGES

ELO's ELDORADO album was among those alleged to contain satanic
backward masked messages. A patient listening to ELDORADO played
backward reveals no such messages. You hear only what you ought to
hear -- the reversed lyrics of the songs, which sound nothing like
the ""messages"" claimed to be there. In the wake of such
allegations, ELO did put an (innocuous) backward message on their
FACE THE MUSIC album. Perhaps they thought this would show how
silly the allegations were. Instead, the backward-masking people
seized on this as proof that the other ""messages"" were real. In
the latest volley, ELO has named an album after the controversy.
     In Britain (where the backward-masking issue is viewed as an
American eccentricity), the cover of SECRET MESSAGES has a mock
warning label to youth about the hidden label. Word of the albums'
impending release in the United States caused enough of a furor to
chill CBS Records into deleting the cover blurb.
     The reversed message is easy to find. It's at the beginning
of the first song, which is itself called ""Secret Messages."" You
can hear reversed speech when you play the record normally. A
voice intones ""secret messages"" -- forward -- in the middle of the
reversed speech, lest anyone dare be so unhip as to not know
what's going on.
     We transferred a new copy of SECRET MESSAGES to reel-to-reel
tapes and played it backward. The backward message goes: ""WELCOME
TO THE BIG SHOW/ WELCOME TO THE BIG SHOW.""
     That's it.


""Ya Hozna""
Frank Zappa, THEM OR US

""Ya Hozna,"" a six-minute composition on the first record of the
THEM OR US double album, is ENTIRELY backward. The albums' inner
cover, which includes lyrics for the other songs, says, ""backwards
vocal -- you figure it out"" of this cut. It credits Frank and Moon
Zappa, George Duke, and Napoleon Murphy Brock as vocalists.
     Played forward, ""Ya Howza"" sounds like a record played
backward -- reasonably so. The vocals are prominent and
unintelligible. Moon Zappa's voice is curiously recognizable, even
in reverse. It is hard to tell whether the music was recorded
forward or backward.
     When ""Ya Howza"" is played in reverse, you discover that the
music is virtually a palindrome -- it sounds about the same
forward and backward. The voices are all backward. In some cases
they have been modified electronically. Many of the words are
muffled. Even after repeated careful listening on both stereo
tracks, it is difficult to make out many of the lyrics. It doesn't
help that some of the words seem to be stream-of-consciousness
nonsense. Some of the unintelligible stuff sounds like opera.
     Starting at the beginning of the reversed tape -- the end of
the forward tape -- the clearer vocals go like this: ""I am the
heaven, I am the water."" This is in a hymnlike register. ""You are
a lonely little girl./ But your mommy and your daddy hold you."" A
singsong synthesizer voice.
     The most interesting part of the lyrics is an intermittently
orgasmic rap in Moon Zappa's Valley Girl voice. There are three
short monologues:

I'm like green!
I'm like squat!
I'm like soul!
Repeat, like soul!
I'm like pull, push,
Okay, like slow, slow.

You're never too old
Like slow, like slow, like slow
Okay, I like it.


All right, faster, faster,
Go, do it, do it twice,
Yeah, that feels good,
I'm looking great,
Yeah, fer shure!
Like, no way!


""No Anchovies, Please""
J. Geils Band, LOVE STINKS

""No Anchovies, Please"" is a novelty song, really a narration with
sound effects, about a woman who is kidnapped after eating
anchovies. She is taken to a ""foreign-speaking"" country. The sound
effect of the foreign tongue seems reversed. When you do play it
in reverse, it becomes: ""It doesn't take a genius to know the
difference between chicken shit and chicken salad.""


""Darling Nikki""
Prince, PURPLE RAIN

""Darling Nikki,"" cited as porn rock before Congress, is about a
dominatrix in a hotel lobby masturbating with a magazine. In part,
the complaint was that the album cover (flowers, and Prince on a
motorcycle) wasn't explicit enough to warn kids of the suggestive
lyrics. Senator Paula Hawkins apparently was not aware of a
backward message hidden in ""Darling Nikki."" The last thirty-five
seconds of the song is gibberish. The music changes abruptly and
becomes a repeated glottal sound. Then a two-syllable sound is
repeated twice, something like ""heaven, heaven."" Unintelligible
speech follows. At the end is a sound reminiscent of rain or bacon
frying , and wind sounds.
     Played backward, the message becomes:

     Hello, how are you?
     I'm fine 'cause I know that the Lord is coming soon.
     Coming, coming soon.

     It is clearly Prince and the Revolution singing this. The
words are clear but the intonation is funny -- the linger on some
words. Perhaps this is to make the reversed message you hear
playing the record normally a little less conspicuous.
     This is a weird reversal of the supposed secret message
menace. Raunchy forward lyrics conceal a religious secret message.


""Judas Kiss""
Petra, MORE POWER TO YOU

Petra is an obscure group that sings religious songs to a rock
beat. As further proof that things have gone full circle, the
backward-masking controversy prompted Petra to include a wholesome
backward message on their MORE POWER TO YOU album. It is in the
transition between two songs, just before ""Judas Kiss."" Clearly
audible gibberish reverses to this (the husky voice a cross
between George Beverly Shea and Dee Snider): ""What are you looking
for the Devil for, when you ought to be looking for the Lord?""

AFL JoyceM Welcome to the Apple II Music & Sound chat - our discussion will
           be on NoiseTracker - the new FTA music program for the GS.  AFA
           Gene will be our host this evening...Gene, the floor is yours :)

AFA Gene   Hi all... well first I'd like to point out, if y'all aren't aware
           yet, that a spanking new version of NoiseTracker has recently
           been released (9 days ago) and is now available in our New Files
           library. It is version 0.5. I haven't played around with it much
           yet, but it's supposed to fix a lot of the little bugs in 0.3
           (the first version we had online).  NoiseTracker also includes
           the ability to directly import ""modules,"" a term used for a
           certain type of Amiga song file which has become popular among PC
           users using the SoundBlaster sound card.

           Now, via NT, these ""MOD"" files are accessible by the GS. We
           expect to see a lot of activity on this end as far as ports from
           the PC and Amiga go. Note that you should be able to go straight
           to the PC music forum and download any recently uploaded MOD
           songfiles (there was a bug in the first wide release of the PCAO
           software, however, so a bunch of files with dates between around
           March 1991 and September 1991 may not download properly. Note that
           to use these PC MOD files, you'll have to rename the downloaded
           file ""MOD.xxxxxx"" if you want it to show up automatically in NT's
           ""open"" dialog box. (On the PC, all MOD files are named
           ""xxxxxxxx.MOD"" instead.)   Also, if the files are packed with ZIP
           compression, you'll need a program from the Communications Forum
           called AGATE -- it's a terminal program that includes the ability
           to unpack ZIP files.

           Now, I guess the best thing to do would be to talk about our
           favorite songfiles... there have been a few complaints, in fact,
           that people were not being ""descriptive"" enough in their file
           descriptions for uploads in describing the songs.

AFC Eddie  ?

AFA Gene   GA ed

AFC Eddie  Once a MOD file is unpacked with Agate, is a file type change
           needed?

AFA Gene   Nope, since all that NT looks for is the ""MOD."" being the first
           four characters in the filename.

AFC Eddie  OK, Thanks!

Deanna7332 Question...

JonL7      Can you list some of the features of Noisetracker?

AFA Gene   (you don't even need that ""MOD."" if you want to type the name in
           directly.)

Deanna7332 Did any of these mod files have anything to do with FTA's ""Module
           A""

AFA Gene   Sure Jon, right after we answer Deanna's question. Deanna, you
           mean ""Modulae?""

Deanna7332 Yes, that's it.

AFA Gene   Modulae was a demo written by FTA last year. (i'll get to you in a
           sec Doors).  It used SoundSmith v0.95 for all it's music. There
           is no connection between MOD files and Modulae by FTA.

Deanna7332 Throughout the demo it said ""Loading modules""

AFA Gene   Those ""modules"" are not the same as Amiga soundfile ""modules"" --
           you see, what Modulae really was was a ""stringing together"" of a
           bunch of neat little tiny demos that FTA had written. So they
           called each little demo a ""module"" and thus the entire demo as a
           whole, ""Modulae"" (fancy plural of module?)

Deanna7332 Ok I understand.  Thank you. :)

AFL JoyceM Latin, Gene :)

AFA Gene   The term ""MODule"" from the Amiga comes from the idea that all the
           stuff needed to play the songfile (all the instruments + the
           sequence file) are included into one file, the ""module.""

TheDoors1  Gene, I have tried to d/l some recent uploaded MODs in the PC
           music area and still the problem exists.

AFA Gene   As I understand it, the problem was fixed VERY recently (correct
           me on this Joyce) and files uploaded as recently as early
           November still might not work depending on the version of the
           PCAO software that the uploader used.

AFL JoyceM Actually, Gene...I was under the impression that it had been, but
           if Doors is still having a problem, then it must not be fixed.

AFA Gene   What date was the file you tried to d/l, Door?

TheDoors1  umm 11/17, around there

AFA Gene   hmmm.... well i can tell you one thing... if it didn't work, don't
           waste your time again later... the problem is in the Apple
           software's method of d/lling files, and there are no plans to
           upgrade the Apple AO software.

AFL JoyceM I will endeavor to get an answer to that PC downloading
           problem/question :)

ThomasK63  i have a quick question... what can you use to unpack amiga mod
           files? On the PC side, that is.

TheDoors1  Agate Thomas

ELECTMUSIC Doors... what happens on after downloading..

Deanna7332 If it's LZHed you can't unless you have an IBM or
           PC/Transporter.

AFA Gene   If GS-ShrinkIt doesn't have that ability, i don't think there
           exists any such utility on the GS.

TheDoors1  What do you mean Elect?

ELECTMUSIC After you download the file... where do you encounter a problem?

TheDoors1  ok, you know when you download the file and at some point in the
           download the file starts to appear on your screen.  That's when I
           cancel it.

ThomasK63  I am sure soething good can be made w/out resorting to Amiga
           files

AFC Eddie  Yes, Doors, I believe the problem is with the PC software it was
           UL'd with.

TheDoors1  yeah Eddie.

GNO Tim    Amiga MOD files are typically compressed using LHarc.  I've
           uncompressed several on my Unix machine at school.

ThomasK63  good time for someone to make a lharc unpacker...

AFC DYAJim someone might be ;)

GNO Tim    Several people are already

AFC Eddie  Can't wait, Jim!

AFA Gene   Jon, did you have a question?

JonL7      The features of Noisetracker :)

AFA Gene   Oh yes... okay, here goes, in a nutshell, from most important to
           least:


AFA Gene   *  ability to import MOD files

           *  ability to import Soundsmith files

           *  ProDOS 8 based

           *  virtually no editing abilities (not a feature but important to
           know)

AFC DYAJim :)

AFA Gene   *  forgot: and the most important feature of all, the ability to
           hold instrument files in regular system RAM instead of DOC RAM,
           allowing for instruments far beyond the regular 64K limit found
           in ALL other GS music programs.

ThomasK63  I'll buy that!

TheDoors1  I have another question...when you're ready.

AFA Gene   GA Doors

TheDoors1  ok..is it true that NoiseTracker will take in soundsmith files and
           play them more clearly

AFA Gene   Well, as far as ""what you hear,"" yes there is a definite
           difference with some instruments. It does NOT play the sounds
           more ""clearly,"" but it just plays them in a different way. What
           many people seem to like about this ""different way"" is that
           sustained instruments (i.e. instruments designed to be played
           in a loop to simulate a long held note) seem to work better (or
           perhaps simply the way they were originally intended to work).

TheDoors1  I see

Deanna7332 Which takes up more space - MOD or NT  w/soundfile ?

AFA Gene   Deanna, it depends a few things, such as how big the sequence is,
           how many instruments you have, etc. Once you have a lot of
           assorted files, it'll probably average out to be about the same
           give or take a hundred blocks on your HD. So it basically depends
           on whether you prefer to have your instruments separate or not.

Deanna7332 Does playing quality differ with either one ?

AFA Gene   Nope. It's exactly the same either way. Loading time is the same
           too.

AFC Eddie  Can NT save songs as MOD files?

AFA Gene   Nope. It has options for Open and Close module, but these are
           still inactive.

AFA Gene   If there are no more questions, I'd like to talk about which NT
           files out there are the ""hottest,"" since this info could be
           useful to many users who are interested in downloading NT/MOD
           files.

           My personal favorite is ""Lambada,"" which is supplied by FTA with
           the program but is available separately on America
           Online.Everything about this file is really impressive except
           perhaps the sound quality of the horn-ish melody instrument.

           What about y'all, what are your favorite NT files?

AFL JoyceM Gene, there is a classical song for NT, but can't remember the
           name, but it is good.

AFC Eddie  I like Dragnet!

ELECTMUSIC So do I Ed

TheDoors1  I like Seven something

Deanna7332 My most favorite of all mod files is Pleasure Principle

AFC Eddie  <--appreciate's Greg's taste!

AFL JoyceM :)

AFA Gene   Deanna, i assume you got that from a local board?

Deanna7332 I got it from the PC forum here.

TheDoors1  I saw it there also

Deanna7332 I think under ""Pleasure""

AFA Gene   Would you be able to upload it here? If it's really that good, we
           ought to have it available directly in our oun NT lib here (BTW
           folks, we will be releasing a new NoiseTracker software library
           soon!)

AFC Eddie  What a Forum!!!

Deanna7332 That sounds great!

AFL JoyceM Gene, do you think it will be possible for synthLAB files to be
           converted to MOD files?

AFL JoyceM MOD files?

AFA Gene   I doubt it, Joyce. The formats are so diametrically opposed in
           their entire basis of their file formats that it wouldn't be
           worth the time for a programmer to develop such a convertor.

Deanna7332 Isn't it possible to move the mod file from the PC forum to our
           music library?

AFA Gene   But..... it might be worth the time for a MIDI File Format to MOD
           convertor, since these two formats are more widely accepted.

Nuzz       they have nothing better to do Gene

ELECTMUSIC Gene.. some interesting similarities with DTune and NTracker

AFA Gene   They lose the file, tho, Deanna. :)

AFL JoyceM In what way, Greg?

ELECTMUSIC Both Prodos 8

Deanna7332 Shhh they won't know a thing :)

ELECTMUSIC I also believe Bill uses a shuttling of sound data between Doc
           Ram and Ram.

AFC Eddie  Interesting, Greg.

ELECTMUSIC Thats how he gets some of the excellent instrument quality

AFC Eddie  But Diversitune has that one distinction:  MIDI input.

AFL JoyceM Deanna, we would greatly appreciate it if you would upload that
           'Pleasure' song to our library :)

ELECTMUSIC Agreed Ed.. one of the factors FTA doesn't like to incorporate
           into their programs.

Deanna7332 I'll u/l it tonight if possible.

AFL JoyceM Thanks :)

AFC Eddie  Thanks, Deanna!

AFL JoyceM I will send Bill B a copy of NoiseTracker + some MOD files...to
           see what comments we get from him (will send when I get back).

AFC DYAJim What ever happened to that diversitune upgrade that was talked
           about ?

ELECTMUSIC That would be interesting Joyce

AFC Eddie  Bill apparently still working on it, Jim.

ELECTMUSIC I am sure he would appreciate the Prodos 8

AFC DYAJim good..

AFL JoyceM Jim...RSN....he was hoping by Christmas (this year), but he is
           soooo busy with his job, who knows?

AFC DYAJim Oh yeah, I noticed the speed calcuation in NT .5 is inaccurate
           :)

AFC DYAJim I recall he has set a lot of Christmas projected dates :)

ELECTMUSIC He was one of the first ""Free Tools"" experts in breaking all the
           rules for economic sake.

AFC DYAJim like for the vaporware DT inst editor like 2 years ago.

Deanna7332 Are there any Christmas Mod or NT songs?

AFC Eddie  Oh yeah, Diversi-Editor!

AFL JoyceM I know, Jim - but that I know he has been working on.

AFC DYAJim he projected Christmas for it, and it never came :)

AFA Gene   Not yet in AMS, but hopefully the Holiday Contest will change all
           that. :)

AFC DYAJim I look foreward to any upgrades..

AFL JoyceM Not that I am aware of Deanna - you have some?  hint, hint

Deanna7332 Nope sorry.  I was hoping there were some that could be u/led
           here

AFC DYAJim I'll be breaking out the xmas tune book rsn.. I should be able to
           midi a few :) (which rules out nt)

AFL JoyceM Question...

AFC Eddie  It would be more appropriate to have a converter from Appleworks
           spreadsheet to MOD than from MIDI!

AFL JoyceM If I got ahold of an Amiga song (MOD) disk...how would I convert
           them for here?

AFA Gene   You mean an Amiga-formatted disk?

AFL JoyceM Yes

AFC DYAJim Ack.. methinks you need an amiga and a null modem cable or a
           modem.

AFA Gene   Methinks Jim is right

AFC DYAJim LOL!!  Design your music in the spreadsheet then import to NT :)
           IT might actually have better editing?!! :)

AFC Eddie  Right!

AFL JoyceM Me thinks he is right.  If I had them upload to me, would that
           work?

AFA Gene   Yep; should work like a charm.

AFC DYAJim Yah.. as long as they're coming from an amiga

AFL JoyceM Great....I will work on that when I get back  (making note now).

AFL JoyceM Gene, will you get some of those files (NT) sent to that area
           tonight?  If so, I will leave the needed message :)

AFA Gene   That's all I have planned for tonight's chat, Joyce. Yep, I'll
           move some files right now.

AFL JoyceM Thanks...

AFL JoyceM Then we should have our NoiseTracker Library by end of the week in
           AMS :)

ELECTMUSIC Gene... quick question:  Are you launching NTracker from a 3.5
           disk?

AFL JoyceM Okay, guys...I will see you all the week of December 11th (may the
           4th) as I am off on vacation.

AFA Gene   Yep greg

AFC JohnC  Where are you going?

ELECTMUSIC Do you encounter out of memory problems

AFL JoyceM Night all...and Gene, thanks for an excellent chat and great
           explanations of NoiseTracker.

Nuzz       Joyce, I have good news for FutureSound owners. SoundConvert will
           support it in the first release

AFC Eddie  Great, Mike!

AFA Gene   Greg, i always keep my RAMdisk at 0 when using noisetracker. Not
           only are

AFC JohnC  Mike...SoundConvert...released?

AFL JoyceM Great, Mike.  When can we get SoundConvert, Mike? and FutureSound
           :)

AFA Gene   there a couple of bugs with memory management, but if you're
           loading in a MOD file that's really big, NT will eat your RAMdisk.

AFC Eddie  Sounds good.

Nuzz       The manual is being ""layout"". Release date should be about 1st
           week of Dec

ELECTMUSIC Tnxs Gene

AFC JohnC  YES.......WTG Nuzz!!!!!!!!

Deanna7332 Yes, why is there on some MOD files a stop somewhere in the middle
           ?

Deanna7332 That's really frustrating!

AFL JoyceM Mike, leave me E-Mail on when and how I can send your the $$ to
           get it.

AFL JoyceM Again...night all

Nuzz       gee John, I had to do something to explain the delay :)

ELECTMUSIC Thanks Gene for a GREAT chat!

AFC Eddie  Yes, Gene!  Great!

AFA Gene   Thanks Greg, 'night!

AFA Gene   thanx, see y'all later :)

Copyright 1987 Bob Szekely.

    John Michael Osbourne, (known as ""Ozzy"" to his fans), has in his long 
career as vocalist for Black Sabbath had his work with the group misconstrued 
as advocating Satanism.  In a 1983 radio special featuring Ozzy, the 
interviewer expressed precisely this point; ""...Ozzy has always been shrouded 
in the darkest of Satanic imagery.  Yet if you really listen to his music, 
you'll find that what he is saying differs greatly from his image....""(1)  Even 
the group's image has often been described as ""occult and diabolic"".(2)

    The important point to remember here is to differentiate between appearance 
and reality.  Although the name ""Black Sabbath"" conjures up images of witches 
and sorcerers paying homage to Satan for the powers bestowed upon them, this 
does not make it safe to assume that the group that went by this name 
necessarily drew the inspiration from the occult.(3)  The closest they ever 
came to it was a gothic horror film featuring Boris Karloff as narrator; they 
adopted their name directly from the name of this film.(4)  Black Sabbath was 
involved in the black arts as much as Karloff practiced casting spells off-
screen.  Tony Iommi, the group's guitarist, summed it up best when he described 
the group as having basically ""...the same appeal as a horror movie.  It's all 
an act.""(5)










    Just as their film counterpart did, Ozzy and Sabbath found the occult 
mythos to be an effective vehicle for powerful social commentary; particularly 
when put in the context of heavy-metal rock and roll.  Ozzy himself noted that 
there are ""...people who pick up my [album] cover[s] and go...'This guy's got 
to be singing about Devil, doom, death and destruction.'  Which is not the 
case....""(6)

    The late Lester Bangs likened the group to Bob Dylan and William Burroughs, 
describing them all as ""...moralists...trying to deal with a serious present 
situation in an honest way....""(7)  Ozzy and Black Sabbath merely bring to 
light the many evils of our world in their work, to try and make us realize 
that we are all victim to their influence.  They hope to make us recognize 
these evils so that we may take up arms against them; a point Ozzy emphatically 
stresses:  ""...one thing everybody has got to understand about Black Sabbath's 
lyrics.  They're not downer lyrics, they're just telling everybody where it's 
at...""(8)  He also cites the group's most controversial tune, ""Black Sabbath"", 
as a response to the ignorant hippie culture still force when the tune was 
written in 1970:  ""The hippies said: 'The world is beautiful man.' (sic)  You 
only had to look around you to see how crappy it was.  It was ridiculous 
listening to that stuff, let alone playing it, so we just wrote about the world 
the way it really was and how it affected us - and we felt better in ourselves 
because we were really being honest....""(9)

    I   1   HAVE YOU EVER THOUGH ABOUT YOUR SOUL-
        2   CAN IT BE SAVED?
        3   OR PERHAPS YOU THINK THAT WHEN YOU ARE DEAD
        4   YOU JUST STAY IN YOUR GRAVE.
        5   IS GOD JUST A THOUGHT WITHIN YOUR HEAD OR IS
        6   HE A PART OF YOU?
        7   IS CHRIST JUST A NAME THAT YOU READ IN A BOOK
        8   WHEN YOU WERE AT SCHOOL?

    II  9   WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT DEATH DO YOU LOSE
        10  YOUR BREATH OR DO YOU KEEP YOUR COOL?
        11  WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE THE POPE ON THE END
        12  OF A ROPE - DO YOU THINK HE'S A FOOL?
        13  WELL I'VE SEEN THE TRUTH - YES I'VE SEEN 
        14  THE LIGHT AND I'VE CHANGED MY WAYS.
        15  AND I'LL BE PREPARED WHEN YOU'RE LONELY 
        16  AND SCARED AT THE END OF OUR DAYS.

    III 17  COULD IT BE YOU'RE AFRAID OF WHAT YOU'R
        18  FRIENDS MIGHT SAY 
        19  IF THEY NEW YOU BELIEVED IN GOD ABOVE
        20  THEY SHOULD REALISE BEFORE THE CRITICISE
        21  THAT GOD IS THE ONLY WAY TO LOVE.

    IV  23  IS YOUR MIND SO SMALL THAT YOU HAVE TO FALL
        24 IN WITH THE PACK WHEREVER THEY RUN
        25  WILL YOU STILL SNEER WHEN DEATH IS NEAR
        26  AND SAY THEY MAY AS WELL WORSHIP THE SUN.

    V   27  I THINK IT WAS TRUE IT WAS PEOPLE LIKE YOU
        28  THAT CRUCIFIED CHRIST
        29  I THINK IT IS SAD THE OPINION YOU HADE WAS THE
        30  ONLY ONE VOICED.
        31  WILL YOU BE SO SURE WHEN YOUR DAY IS NEAR
        32  SAY YOU DON'T BELIEVE?
        33  YOU HAD THE CHANCE BUT YOU TURNED IT DOWN
        34  NOW YOU CAN'T RETRIEVE.










    VI  35  PERHAPS YOU'LL THINK BEFORE YOU SAY THAT
        36  GOD IS DEAD AND GONE
        37  OPEN YOUR EYES, JUST REALIZE THAT HE IS THE
        38  ONE.
        39  THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN SAVE YOU KNOW FROM
        40  ALL THIS SIN AND HATE.
        41  OR WILL YOU STILL JEER AT ALL YOU HEAR?
        42  YES!-I THINK IT'S TOO LATE.

    In this piece, the group asserts a belief in an afterlife and spiritual 
redemption.  As grisly as the image of a hanged pontiff is, its shock value is 
a necessary part of the message:  They reject religious dogma, stating that a 
belief in God, in one's own heart, is the only guiding light to help one inn 
his life (lines 11/12, 39/40).  Furthermore, the reject religious hypocrisy 
(lines 5/6, 7/8) and peer pressure (verses III, IV) as excuses for not 
accepting God.  To clarify further:  following the crowd does not justify 
shrugging responsibility for one's own actions.

    After re-reading, it becomes obvious that this song is an ascerbic critique 
of atheism; (line 35/36) I refer here again to verses three and four.  In these 
two verses, the picture painted in one of Godless conformity and how it's 
viewed as being as foolish as Paganism.  These lyrics set an example for the 
listener by relating personal experience (lines 13-16).  However, for those who 
cannot accept this the group has no recourse but to condemn them, although 
rather ironically; they hope that their rhetorical loss of faith in the 
listener will open his eyes (line 42).










                           B L A C K   S A B B A T H 



            WHAT IS THIS, THAT STANDS BEFORE ME?
            FIGURE IN BLACK, WHICH POINTS AT ME
            TURN ROUND QUICK AND START TO RUN
            FIND OUT I'M THE CHOSEN ONE.  OH, NO!
            
            BIG BLACK SHAPE WITH EYES OF FIRE
            TELLING PEOPLE THEIR DESIRE
            SATAN'S SITTING THERE, HE'S SMILING
            WATCHES THOSE FLAMES GET HIGHER AND HIGHER
            OH, NO, NO, -- PLEASE GOD HELP ME!
            
                IS THIS THE END MY FRIEND?
                SATAN'S COMING 'ROUND THE BEND
                PEOPLE RUNNING 'CAUSE THEY'RE SCARED
                THE PEOPLE BETTER GO AND BEWARE
                NO, NO!  PLEASE--NO!!
                
                
    The all time controversy winner!  Is this not irrefutably  THE song about 
Black Magic in rock?  It's all so obvious, suffuse with evil imagery; Satan, 
walls of flame, figure in black, and damnation at the end.  Yes, I see the 
images too; it definitely concerns Black Magic.  Then again, Shakespeare's 
Macbeth employed scenes of witches involved in conjurations; does that mean 
that Shakespeare was a warlock?  Poe used to write sardonic tragedies about 
twisted murderers and the bizarre nature of acts, did that make him an evil, 
leering, demented killer?  Did either of them advocated what they wrote about?  
One has to remember that writing about something is not necessarily the same as 
emulating it.  Tony Iommi spoke out quite strongly about this:  ""People are 
bringing us down saying that we are a Black Magic group.  I think they must be










getting mixed up with Black Widow.  We don't do any sacrifices on stage, and 
we're not on a black magic kick.  We wanted to do heavy numbers and the guitar 
riffs we worked out were more suited to evil things than love.  We play songs 
about black magic, but they are more likely to be against than for it.""(12)  

    By now, you're probably asking yourself who Black Widow is, right?  Then 
it's time for a little history:

        Sabbath, before they were known as Sabbath, had the same line-up but 
two earlier names.  The first one was Polka Tulk, which seemed sure to doom 
them to obscurity.(13)  The soon realized this and changed the group's name to 
Earth.  Now, Earth was a blues band at the end of the English blues boom.  As 
if that wasn't bad enough, they soon discovered that not only was there another 
group named Earth, but they had also released a single.  To avoid confusion, 
they changed their name again.(14)  But what made them decide on that name?  
Just ask Ozzy:  ""I just liked the name Black Sabbath because of the succession 
of vowel sounds.(15)  If that sounds ludicrous just consider this:  Sabbath was 
""...the first of the really committed, loud and heavy bands...""(16)  They 
needed a name to match the gut-wrenching power they were developing.  Tony knew 
that he wanted Sabbath to be noticed above all the rest of the British blues 
bands:  ""We wanted something of our own that we'd like and people would like.  
And we wanted something loud!""










    Tony didn't hate the blues.  He'd cut his teeth as a guitarist on the likes 
of The Shadows, Buddy Holly and Django Rheinhardt, developing his own style 
from there.  But he realized the group had no future in the blues:

        'We couldn't keep playing 12-bars forever.  We just got fed up with 
Earth music.  It was jazz, blues stuff.  It was good for practice but nothing 
else.'

    In the late 'Sixties, blues groups were a dime a dozen in Birmingham and 
interest was waning in the blues boom due to the glut of groups.  One man, by 
the name of Jim Simpson, had heard Earth around the Birmingham club circuit and 
understood what they were trying to do.  He decided to take them under his 
wing.  With the aid of his massive record collection, Jim expanded the group's 
horizons in the areas of jazz and blues.  He introduced them to artists like 
Wes Montgomery, Count Basie and Jimmy Rushing.  It was from Rushing in 
particular that they derived the repetitive riff style so readily noticeable in 
their later incarnation as Black Sabbath.

    The Count Basie influence is evidenced in the song ""Wicked World"" from the 
first album; Sabbath drummer Bill Ward uses a ""'sighing hi-hat'...in the manner 
of Basie's drummer Jo Jones.""










    The influence is subtle, almost subliminal.  Yet it is one which was not 
thought capable of hard, 'heavy' rock bands in the late 'Sixties.  Although Led 
Zeppelin and Jimi Hendrix also had their work steeped in blues and jazz 
derivations (Hendrix' ""Third Stone From the Sun"" and Zeppelin's version of 
Willie Dixon's ""I Can't Quit You Baby"" from their first album), neither was 
able to match the intense energy of Black Sabbath.  Iommi has always had a 
preference for music with an original, distinct style of its' own; as an 
example, he mentions guitarists Joe Pass and Alvin Lee as two of his strongest 
songwriting influences.

    It would also be necessary that Sabbath develop a unique, distinctive style 
and image of their own.  Though they had changed their name from Earth to Black 
Sabbath to avoid confusion with the other Earth; at the same time another group 
emerged by the name of Black Widow ""...who WERE profoundly influenced by the 
occult, had a male witch as a patron, and wrote pieces like ""Come to The 
Sabbat.""  Unfortunately, Sabbath was constantly reaping the benefits of Widow's 
publicity.

    Sabbath was a group that never minced words.  If they saw something as 
destructive, they would be sure to rub the listener's face it it.  They did not 
want their point to be missed.

    With their straightforward, sometimes brutal way of looking at things, they 
try to shock the listener's conscience back into awareness.  The imagery of 
""Hand of Doom"", from the Paranoid album, is candid and condemning; it is a 
strong statement against drug addiction and rightly so...

    Many people felt the group's overall direction was pessimistic and had a 
negative effect on its listener's due to that.  ""Ozzy insisted that if people 
thought he was having a bad effect on the minds of young kids, they should go 
and watch the TV news where real murder and mayhem were a way of life, and 
shown night after night."" (18)

    Sabbath was never negative in their message; they were simply truthful 
about waht they saw as wrong in the world.  If you ""Strip away the horror 
stories, the imagery and the hysteria, (and) turn down the amps a notch...you 
have a well-rehearsed, solid blues and rock band, powered by a dedication to 
well defined objectives.""  On the top of the list of those objectives was 
truth; Sabbath never feared facing that truth squarely, regardless of what many 
people thought of them.

X-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-X
Long, long, time ago,
I can still remember,
When the local calls were ""free"".
And I knew if I paid my bill,
And never wished them any ill,
That the phone company would let me be...

But Uncle Sam said he knew better,
Split 'em up, for all and ever!
We'll foster competition:
It's good capital-ism!

I can't remember if I cried,
When my phone bill first tripled in size.
But something touched me deep inside,
The day... Bell System... died.

And we were singing...

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

Is your office Step by Step,
Or have you gotten some Crossbar yet?
Everybody used to ask...
Oh, is TSPS coming soon?
IDDD will be a boon!
And, I hope to get a Touch-Tone phone, real soon...

The color phones are really neat,
And direct dialing can't be beat!
My area code is ""low"":
The prestige way to go!

Oh, they just raised phone booths to a dime!
Well, I suppose it's about time.
I remember how the payphones chimed,
The day... Bell System... died.

And we were singing...

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

Back then we were all at one rate,
Phone installs didn't cause debate,
About who'd put which wire where...
Installers came right out to you,
No ""phone stores"" with their ballyhoo,
And 411 was free, seemed very fair!

But FCC wanted it seems,
To let others skim long-distance creams,
No matter 'bout the locals,
They're mostly all just yokels!

And so one day it came to pass,
That the great Bell System did collapse,
In rubble now, we all do mass,
The day... Bell System... died.

So bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

I drove on out to Murray Hill,
To see Bell Labs, some time to kill,
But the sign there said the Labs were gone.
I went back to my old CO,
Where I'd had my phone lines, years ago,
But it was empty, dark, and ever so forlorn...

No relays pulsed,
No data crooned,
No MF tones did play their tunes,
There wasn't a word spoken,
All carrier paths were broken...

And so that's how it all occurred,
Microwave horns just nests for birds,
Everything became so absurd,
The day... Bell System... died.

So bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

We were singing:

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?

I hear Valkyries a-comin                There are people into Voodoo
In the air their song is comin          there are people into Voodoo

But they're good enough for me!         and it's good enough for me!

We will venerate Bubastis             We will read from the Kabahlah

We will all bow down to Enlil       There are some who practice Shinto
We will all bow down to Enlil       there are some who practice Shinto
Pass your Cup and get a refill!     there's no telling what WE'RE into!
With bold Gilgamesh the Brave!      but that's good enough for me!

We will all see Aphrodite               We will all sing Hare Krishna
Though she's pretty wild and flighty    We will all sing Hare Krishna
She will meet us in her nightie         It's not mentioned in the Mishna
And she's good enough for me!           But it's good enough for me!

It was good enough for Loki         We will all go to Nirvana

Here's to those who copy Conan    There will be a lot of lovin
Here's to those who copy Conan    when we're meetin in our Coven
They're just Followers of Onan    Quit yer pushin and yer shovin
and that's good enough for me!    So there's room enough for me!

We will have a mighty Party           It was good enough for Sappho
In the honor of Astarte               With her lady on her lap-o
Grab your chiton - don't be tardy     She put Lesbos on the map-o
'Cause she's good enough for me!      With her pagan poetry!

Shall we sing a verse for Venus,    Well the Christians all are humming
Of the Gods she is the meanest,     Cause they say their God is coming,
Cause she bit me on my...elbow      Our God came three times this evening
And it's good enough for me.        And that's good enough for me.

   Now here's a story, a little bit gory,
   A little bit happy, a little bit sad.
   About a drink called Imperium Compound
   And how the SCA's been had!                       

   Chorus: Oh we think, we think, we think,
           The King is a fink, a fink, a fink,
           A figure of respectability
           Rules the Kingdom thru Imperium Compound
           The results are plain to see!

   Mongol Hordemen, those free-living swordsmen
   Subverting the Kingdoms from underneath!
   Have no use for Imperium Compound
   Except perhaps to brush their teeth!

   AltChorus: Oh we fink, we fink, we fink,
              The Khan and the Kink, the Kink, the Kink,
              And the Board, their Great Senilities!
              The Western Irgun, drinks Imperium Compound
              And we're BACK, with results you'll see!    

   Lady Laurel, with Authority Royal,
   Passes and rejects our heraldry
   She needs a swig of Imperium Compound
   Then perhaps she'd deign to talk to me!            

   Lady Trude thought it her duty
   To turn a social wrong into a Right
   Proved her point with Imperium Compound
   And showed that Cheshire Cats can fight!  //and scratch//

   The Board of Directors styled themselves The Electors
   And another con they tried to swing
   Now the BoD drinks Imperium Compound
   So we no longer need a King!                        

   AltChorus: Oh the Bod, the BoD, the BoD,
              It thinks it is God, is God, is God,
              The figure of Supreme Authority!
              And if we O.D.'d on Imperium Compund
              there'd be no need for Royalty!          

   Oh, MEDIEVAL Net, we thought it was all wet
   With witty remarks, and other kinds of sass
   We'll feed our computers on Imperium Compound
   And BYTE the BoD right on its' righteous ass!         

   Good old Duncan was often drunken
   Chasing all the ladies fair
   He bathed himself in Imperium Compound
   Now he has a little savoir faire!

   Took a swig of Imperium Compound
   And won the Crown his first time out!                    

   All the Crusadenes were big, but not mean,
   And the finest fighters in the town.
   But they all drank Jerusalem Compound,
   Winning Crown after Crown after Crown!                 

   Good Duke Arthur couldn't get no farth-er
   A Norman King in Aten Land
   Drank too much of Imperium Compound
   And went off to conquer Engel-land!                    

   Then King Richard, a bit of a bitch, heard
   A King's Crown could be done.
   Drank a little Imperium Compound
   And became the Aten King, first one!                    

   Duchess Malinda, who doesn't do windas,
   But she does a lot of Duchess Things,
   But give her a LOT of Imperium Compound,
   And she sings and sings and sings and sings and sings!   

   Duke Sir Brion, with his pretty white suit on,
   Is a model of goodness and purity
   Never touches Imperium Compound
(spoken:) And I'll sell ya seashore property in Yuma, too!  

   Optional last verse:

   Many tales abound of Imperium Compound
   And its' strange effects on Royalty,
   But after an hour, this song has no power,
   And by now, it's boring ME!                            

   AltChorus: Oh it's too long, too long, too long
              To sing the whole song, the song, the song
              Longer than a Royal Court, it is!
              But sing it serial, this ditty Imperial
              And you'll be a bardic whiz!

        Last night I had the strangest dream in this bleak century
        I dreamed that people the world around believed in Chivalry

        I dreamed I saw a Kingly Crown enshrined in laurel leaves
        with Grace and Joy and Purity attendant at his feet

        I dreamed I saw the perfect Knight receive his accolade
        and minstrels sang and children laughed in some soft forest glade

        I dreamed I saw the finest thing that ever man could make
        grow great and strong and undefiled: Pray God I never wake!

        Last night I had the strangest dream in this bleak century
        I dreamed that people the world around believed in Chivalry

               (to the tune of ""Good King Wenceslaus"")

                Locksley Monsters never yield
                on the field of battle
                strike the helm and bash the shield
                make their eyeteeth rattle
                Bodies on the ground will lie
                bones will burst in sunder
                search for Locksleys' enemies:
                You'll find them six feet under!

                              SONG OF IVANOF

            There is a man who we know well that does the best he can
            but he's displayed in armour made of reticulated garbage cans!

            He looks so fine and fair and strong, oh how he plays the man
            and how it's prized, those galvanized, reticulated garbage cans

            The noblest Roman of them all, a good Praetorian
            a combatant who wears no pants, judst reticulated garbage cans!

            Like old Horatius at the Bridge, like the Legions of Valerian
            (O dearie me: those LOVELY knees!)
            and those reticulated garbage cans!

                         C. McCray Bethancourt

         (sung to the tune (obviously) of the 12 Days of Christmas)


1.           The first time I sent my device, The Heralds said to me

            ""It violates the Rule of Three""

2.           The next time I tried it, the Heralds said to me

            ""We changed the forms, and it violates the Rule of
             Three"".

3.           The third time I tried, and the Heralds said to me, 

            ""We upped the fees, we changed the forms, and it
             violates the Rule of Three"".

4.           Another time I tried and the Heralds said to me,
 
            ""We haven't got it, we upped the fees, we changed the 
             forms, and it violates the Rule of Three"".

5.           The fifth time I tried it, the Heralds said to me,  

            ""In a decision rendered by the College of Arms on
             August 1st, A.S. V it was decided that this style of
             heraldic design was not appropriate to the aims and 
             intentions of the Corporate Body. Holy! Holy! Holy! ""

 note: verse 5 is delivered in an extremely fast, mono-
       tone, similiar to a Gregorian Chant.

           "" ....we haven't got it, we upped the fees, we changed the forms,
             and it violates the Rule of Three.""

6.           I tried it a sixth time, and the Heralds said to me,

            ""We changed the rules, &c""

7.           A seventh time I tried and, the Heralds said to me,

            ""It's against the Rule of Tincture, we changed the
             rules, &c""

8.           I tried it once again and the heralds said to me,

            ""It's not a Period design, It's against the Rule of Tincture, We
             changed the rules, &c""

                                * more *



    Heralds Said To Me (cont.)

9.           I sent it in once more, and the Heralds said to me,

            ""We changed the rules again, It's not a Period design,
             it's against the Rule of Tincture, we changed the
             rules, &c""

10. (sung in cold anger)
             The LAST time I sent my device, the Heralds said to me

    (sung in a state of SMUG)
             ""Someone else has got it, &c""




              (nb: every single one of these reasons has been used by the
              CoA, at one point or another, to reject perfectly good
              heraldry, along with some even MORE stupid.  If the shoe 
              fits....................!!!!!!!!)

           or: Who was that Vermin I saw you with last, Knight?
   or: There may be Lice on all you Knice, but there ain't no Lice on me

           Once there was a Barony howling in the wilderness
           nestled in the Valley where the River doesn't flow
           and the folks were driven buggy by the insects in the Revel Hall
           Authenticity is wonderful, but this doesn't go!

                   Bugs on the Baroness, bugs on the Baroness!
                   That was the cry that you heard all the day
                   and the scratching can be heard from Ysgithr to Ered Sul
                   why did we come here? Let's go away!

           See them all a scratching, nestled in their armour tight
           the fleas have a melee team that's challenging the field!
           call Truly Nolen! Someone's gotta help us out!
           the crabs are nesting in our helms but we'll never yield!

                   (chorus)

           Dawn comes a-breaking, the bugs have won the Coronet...
           flea-infested Conan-clones in piles upon the lawn
           where is the Barony? The bugs have eaten everyone...
           termites got the stick-jocks, and all their sticks are gone!

                          tune: The West's Awake

                  For all the Lands where I have dwelt
                  Oh Atenveldt, Oh Atenveldt
                  till rivers burn and mountains melt
                  lest I forget my Atenveldt
                  From deserts stark to snow-capped peaks
                  from silent lakes and laughing creeks
                  sing: Oh let man find his heart's ease
                  on rocky plains
                  in desert breeze

                  For oft I thought of mighty men
                  who carved a Land with sword and pen
                  and lit a candle, burning bright,
                  that pierced the darkness; stirred the night!
                  tho some are gone their deeds remain
                  this sunny Crown without a stain
                  sing: Oh, their deeds were not in vain!
                  in sunlit days
                  and falling rain.....

                  So raise your banners, blazoned bright
                  Advance the Dream and Shine the Light!
                  in battle's crash and Revel's song
                  raise high the Flag and wave it long!
                  For all the Lands wherein I've dwelt
                  I love you best, my Atenveldt!
                  Sing: Oh the Joy that I have felt!
                  My Atenveldt
                  My Atenveldt

      What the use of wearing panties
      whalebone corsets of your Auntie's
      boxer shorts and other scanties
      best of all is nude
      there's such fun in going bra-less
      now that it's no longer lawless
      'specially if your figure's flawless
      best of all is nude
      nude is what you're born in
      shirts are never torn in
      underwear and lacy flimsies, garter belts and other whimsies
      yards of itchy cloth to put your form in
      ducks all do it, maidens rue it
      even ancient Picts in Britain blue it
      going naked's how to do it
      best of all is nude!

      If your garters aren't elastic
      tie them up in knots fantastic
      (panty hose is something drastic!)
      best of all is nude!
      If you're tired of wearing clotheses
      shed your garment 'mongst the roses
      never mind the old bluenoses
      best of all is nude!
      Nude is best for ducking!
      Worst for horses bucking!
      Moonlit nights will see such sights
          that are very best for fooling round
                              .....and elbows!
      Nudity is grand to see
       a well-known antidote to virginity
      take your clothes off and you'll see:
      best of all is nude!

                   the Legion with it's Eagles bright
                   marched into the Pictish night
                   met them there upon the sand
                   gave em up to the Wicker Man!

                   eight-legged steed and hound of Hel

               and thinks on a Day that's coming fast
               when we shall all be....civilized....(puke)
               neat, and clean.....and WELL-ADVISED

        Before I knew M'Lady's name and heard her constant whinin'
        I thought all girls were beautiful and the sun was always shinin'

        she curdled milk, aborted cows, and stopped my stamps from stickin'!

        Away out here they have a name for everything worth seein'

        M'Lady disappeared one day, and that for sure is scary
        she was the result of experiments by a deranged Vetinary!

                    WEAPONS AT THE DOOR

 Being a Polemic concerning the alleged Custom of the West Kingdom concerning 
 checking your Weapons at the Door of the Revel Hall. As the Satire is the 
 Weapon of the Bard, this said Polemic is to be checked at the Door, along with 
 swords, knives, redheaded Ladies and other such Deadly Things.....

         As I roved out to Western Lands to take the Western Air
         I went into a Revel Hall and I saw a Twelfth Night there
         but I was halted at the gate by a Privy Consellor
                 (that's the man who tells the King of the West how to go to
                  the bath room!)
         who told me I would have to check my Weapons at the door

         As I, in my astonishment, stood hung on tenter-pegs
         a Knight came in whose Prouess hung down between his legs
         the Doorman grabbed a greatsword and he struck the Knight full sore
         and gave him a reciept; he left his weapon at the door!

         a Bard was next whose goodly Voice has entertained us all
         but he, too, was prevented from entering the Hall
         and told he could not carry deadly weapons on the floor
         he left his Voice and Harp among the weapons at the door

         a Master entered graciously, a man we all know well
         who holds a 3rd Dan Black Belt, tho this he'd never tell
         the Master struggled valiantly, the Master cursed and swore
         but he left his hands, and feet, as weapons at the door

         the company was jovial, altho a bit dismayed
         for lack of proper cutlery, down to the smallest blade
         for even teeth and fingernails, each can be used in War
         were cut, and pulled, and left behind, as weapons at the door!

         And has their King not loyal Knights that He must be afraid
         of brawling in his Hall and of Assassin's bloody blade?
         the Rights of Men to carry Arms at least WE'VE not foreswore
         and a POX on them that made the Rule of Weapons at the Door!

                           THE STREETS OF ANN ARBOR

               As I walked out thru the streets of Ann Arbor
               as I walked out thru Ann Arbor one day
               I spied a young Mongol all dressed in white linen
               all dressed in white linen and cold as the clay

               I then spied another, done in on the sidewalk
               along with just about six dozen more
               their wounds were all gaping, from mace and from braoadsword
               from claymore and cannon, all dripping with gore

               what caused this grave carnage, I cried to the Monglos
               oh pray what's the reason for this awful sight
               my answer came slowly from under the corpse-pile
               ""It seems that our bark is much worse than our bite.....""

               the answer continued from pale lips a-shaking
               we sang all our songs and believed them as true
               the Dark Horde could never be beaten in battle
               we thought this was what all good Mongols could do...

               we went down to Atenveldt all for to plunder
               ""too large to defend"" was our song every night
               but Atenveldt's different from East, West or Middle
               there, even the bushes have learned how to bite!

               the Clann stole our ponies, the Scraelings our foodstuffs
               we ran into axes in AtenViking hands
               our maidens ran off with one Richard of Arkham
               and we're all that's left to return to our lands

               MacChluarains and Monsters, Lockehaven and Foxmoor
               that Kingdom is BIG and its' fighters are MEAN!
               we fought and we lost, and fled back to Ann Arbor
               we all came back home with results that you've seen

               keep away from that Land with its' cactus and marshes
               it's no place for Mongols who are bent on War
               they count their blows well, but they strick them yet better
               he crawled into his Yurt, and fell, dead, on the floor.....

       tune: the song of the Cowardly Lion, Tin Woodsman and Scarecrow
             in the movie version of the Wizard of Oz

        (Enter the Scarecrow, who singeth:)

        My wife is always nagging; my Prowess it is lagging
        I can't do anything
        she has got a reason, but revenge is out of season
        Oh I wish I could be King!

        If I just had the Crown on, I'd always have a frown on
        and the Barons on a string
        Heads they would be rolling, the Board would be cajoling
        Oh if only I was King!

        I am very fed up with the way this group is set up
        Oh I'd change everything!
        they are so high and mighty with the way that they do fight-ey
        Oh, someday I'll be King!

        Tho my wife is melancholic, and very...vitriolic
        she's a wasp without a sting!
        I'd have to supervise her with a pack of tranquilizers
        If I only was a King......

        (the Tin Woodsman joineth him, and singeth:)

        I grew up kind of cocky, and rather big, and stocky
        and straight as any rod
        on the field I'm a battallion, with the Ladies I'm a stallion
        ...Oh they'd better make me God!

        The other boys are jealous they say I'm over-zealous
        they'd do better to applaud
        the things that I am giving to this Dream that we are living
        oh I wish they'd make me God!

        They say that I'm conceited, but I'm just badly treated
        by people and by BoD
        just think of what they're missing by My Majesty dismissing
        Oh they'd better make me God!

        (the Cowardly Lion creepeth forth, and singeth:)

        Oh I could be a fighter, a great and mighty smiter
        and be the perfect knight
        it's a great and nasty shame, and everyone's to blame
        oh I wish that I could fight!

        Song of the Three (cont.)

        I could be a Cavalier drinking wine and ale and beer
        and be a gorgeous sight
        but it would cost me too much money so it isn't very funny
        oh I wish that I could fight!                               

        Let me at 'em on the field, I would surely make them yield
        to my Power and my Might
        with rattan, shinai and rapier they would nevermore escape here
        If they'd only let me fight

                She was worried that ""something might show..""
                She was afraid to come out to the Tourney
                And the poor thing did NOT want to go...

                The Mongols invaded the Middle
                But the Middle did not want to play...

          I'd rather sing a song than work (if it's not too phrasey!)
          Lengthy rhymes don't bother me....truth to tell: I'm lazy!

          Yang, your yurt is very nice, and your Horde is smelly,
          And I'm sure that yak-meat will nicely fill one's belly!
          But remember this one line, or you're not worth jelly:
          FIRST you plunder, THEN you burn! That's how to be rakehelly!

          My Lady Lorelei your eyes do drive me to distraction
          And the lovely Care-Cheri causes....petrifaction!

          Now Atenveldt your fighters, all, are most good and gentle
          And the Ladies, bless 'em all, are most ornamental!
          But that little Nikki-Toad....has me sentimental
          Though with boffer in her hand she is argumental!

          This stupid little song, m'lords, is mostly sung in Latin
          By the Goliards, of course, from vespers clear to matins!
          But I prefer a coarser cloth over silk or satins
          English is more understood, mine enemies to flatten!

          Good People all, I've made my Song, its' music's well-recited
          But my voice could use some work; the flowers it has blighted!
          It's rude and rusty, grim and bad, and squeaky like a door-hinge,
          But I'm a better Bard than you: I found a rhyme for ""orange!""

                      by William Poundstone
                              1983

     Two mentalities are at work here: 1960s rock fans and 1980s
fundamentalist Christians. The idea of phonographically concealed
messages dates from the Paul McCartney death scare of 1969. For
hard-core types, the secret-message rumors never really died. Avid
rock fans have auditioned ever album release since the late 1960s
for hidden nuances. Backward messages, barely audible messages,
and messages on one stereo track only have been alleged. At the
other end of the sociosensual spectrum, fundamentalist Christians
have gotten into the act. TV programs such as PRAISE THE LORD and
THE 700 CLUB have propagated rumors of a satanic plot in the
recording industry, no less, in which various albums conceal
""backward-masked"" demonic murmurings. If THAT sounds too spacey to
be taken seriously, consider that it was the fundamentalist groups
who were behind House Resolution 6363, a bill introduced in the
U.S. House of Representatives by Robert K. Dornan (R., Calif.) in
1982 to label all suspect records: ""WARNING: THIS RECORD CONTAINS
BACKWARD MASKING THAT MAKES A VERBAL STATEMENT WHICH IS AUDIBLE
WHEN THIS RECORD IS PLAYED BACKWARD AND WHICH MAY BE PERCEPTIBLE
AT A SUBLIMINAL LEVEL WHEN THIS RECORD IS PLAYED FORWARD."" In
February 1983, the Arkansas State Senate passed a similar record-
labeling bill by a vote of 86 to 0.
     Contributing to the quasi-occult status of these rumors is
the difficulty of checking them out on home audio equipment. You
pretty much have to take someone else's word for it, or dismiss
the rumors out of hand.
     From a technical standpoint, there are four simple ways to
conceal a verbal message on a recording. The most obvious is to
record the message at a very low volume. The message may then be
recovered by turning the volume up while playing the record or
tape. If the message is faint enough, though, noise levels of home
equipment may garble it. If the accompanying music or lyrics are
loud enough, or if the message itself is indistinct or
electronically modified, it may be hard to hear on any equipment.
     A second gimmick is to record a message on one stereo track
only. Records and tapes have two independent recordings, of
course, normally played simultaneously for stereo effect. On a
record, each stereo track occupies on one side of the V-shaped
groove for the needle. On a tape, the tracks are recorded in
parallel lanes of the magnetic material. The two tracks are called
""right"" and ""left"" after the stereo speakers they will play on.
Otherwise, the tracks are interchangeable -- the sound mixer can
put anything he or she wants on each track. A message on one track
can be masked by simultaneous loud music or lyrics on the opposite
track. With normal stereo balance (or mono equipment) the loud
track drowns out the message track. At home, single-track messages
can be recovered by adjusting the stereo balance so that only the
desired track plays. Sometimes this trick also makes indistinct
words clearer. Even if the words are not exclusively on one track,
they may happen to be more audible on one track.
     A message could be recorded at a speed different from the
rest of the record. Then the record would have to be played faster
or slower than usual to recover the message. Unless the message
was at one of the standard speeds (say, 45 rpm on a 33 1/3 rpm
record), it could not be played normally on home equipment.
     The fourth and most commonly alleged trick is to record a
verbal message backward. Reversed speech has several unexpected
features. One is that syllables are not a constant in the reversal
process. A one-syllable word can have two or three syllables when
played backward. Thus ""number nine"" in the Beatles' REVOLUTION 9
reverses to ""Turn me on, dead man"" (or something like it), a jump
from three to five syllables.
     There is no simple way to predict what a word or phrase will
sound like reversed. Obviously, you can't just reverse the
letters.
     Reversed messages are difficult to recover at home. Record
turntables are not built to go backwards. Some have a neutral
setting, in which the pickup and amplifier remain active and you
can turn the record backward by hand. But hardly anyo

    John Michael Osbourne, (known as ""Ozzy"" to his fans), has in his long 
career as vocalist for Black Sabbath had his work with the group misconstrued 
as advocating Satanism.  In a 1983 radio special featuring Ozzy, the 
interviewer expressed precisely this point; ""...Ozzy has always been shrouded 
in the darkest of Satanic imagery.  Yet if you really listen to his music, 
you'll find that what he is saying differs greatly from his image....""(1)  Even 
the group's image has often been described as ""occult and diabolic"".(2)

    The important point to remember here is to differentiate between appearance 
and reality.  Although the name ""Black Sabbath"" conjures up images of witches 
and sorcerers paying homage to Satan for the powers bestowed upon them, this 
does not make it safe to assume that the group that went by this name 
necessarily drew the inspiration from the occult.(3)  The closest they ever 
came to it was a gothic horror film featuring Boris Karloff as narrator; they 
adopted their name directly from the name of this film.(4)  Black Sabbath was 
involved in the black arts as much as Karloff practiced casting spells off-
screen.  Tony Iommi, the group's guitarist, summed it up best when he described 
the group as having basically ""...the same appeal as a horror movie.  It's all 
an act.""(5)










    Just as their film counterpart did, Ozzy and Sabbath found the occult 
mythos to be an effective vehicle for powerful social commentary; particularly 
when put in the context of heavy-metal rock and roll.  Ozzy himself noted that 
there are ""...people who pick up my [album] cover[s] and go...'This guy's got 
to be singing about Devil, doom, death and destruction.'  Which is not the 
case....""(6)

    The late Lester Bangs likened the group to Bob Dylan and William Burroughs, 
describing them all as ""...moralists...trying to deal with a serious present 
situation in an honest way....""(7)  Ozzy and Black Sabbath merely bring to 
light the many evils of our world in their work, to try and make us realize 
that we are all victim to their influence.  They hope to make us recognize 
these evils so that we may take up arms against them; a point Ozzy emphatically 
stresses:  ""...one thing everybody has got to understand about Black Sabbath's 
lyrics.  They're not downer lyrics, they're just telling everybody where it's 
at...""(8)  He also cites the group's most controversial tune, ""Black Sabbath"", 
as a response to the ignorant hippie culture still force when the tune was 
written in 1970:  ""The hippies said: 'The world is beautiful man.' (sic)  You 
only had to look around you to see how crappy it was.  It was ridiculous 
listening to that stuff, let alone playing it, so we just wrote about the world 
the way it really was and how it affected us - and we felt better in ourselves 
because we were really being honest....""(9)

    In this piece, the group asserts a belief in an afterlife and spiritual 
redemption.  As grisly as the image of a hanged pontiff is, its shock value is 
a necessary part of the message:  They reject religious dogma, stating that a 
belief in God, in one's own heart, is the only guiding light to help one inn 
his life (lines 11/12, 39/40).  Furthermore, the reject religious hypocrisy 
(lines 5/6, 7/8) and peer pressure (verses III, IV) as excuses for not 
accepting God.  To clarify further:  following the crowd does not justify 
shrugging responsibility for one's own actions.

    After re-reading, it becomes obvious that this song is an ascerbic critique 
of atheism; (line 35/36) I refer here again to verses three and four.  In these 
two verses, the picture painted in one of Godless conformity and how it's 
viewed as being as foolish as Paganism.  These lyrics set an example for the 
listener by relating personal experience (lines 13-16).  However, for those who 
cannot accept this the group has no recourse but to condemn them, although 
rather ironically; they hope that their rhetorical loss of faith in the 
listener will open his eyes (line 42).

            OH, NO, NO, -- PLEASE GOD HELP ME!
            
                IS THIS THE END MY FRIEND?
                SATAN'S COMING 'ROUND THE BEND
                PEOPLE RUNNING 'CAUSE THEY'RE SCARED
                THE PEOPLE BETTER GO AND BEWARE
                NO, NO!  PLEASE--NO!!
                
                
    The all time controversy winner!  Is this not irrefutably  THE song about 
Black Magic in rock?  It's all so obvious, suffuse with evil imagery; Satan, 
walls of flame, figure in black, and damnation at the end.  Yes, I see the 
images too; it definitely concerns Black Magic.  Then again, Shakespeare's 
Macbeth employed scenes of witches involved in conjurations; does that mean 
that Shakespeare was a warlock?  Poe used to write sardonic tragedies about 
twisted murderers and the bizarre nature of acts, did that make him an evil, 
leering, demented killer?  Did either of them advocated what they wrote about?  
One has to remember that writing about something is not necessarily the same as 
emulating it.  Tony Iommi spoke out quite strongly about this:  ""People are 
bringing us down saying that we are a Black Magic group.  I think they must be










getting mixed up with Black Widow.  We don't do any sacrifices on stage, and 
we're not on a black magic kick.  We wanted to do heavy numbers and the guitar 
riffs we worked out were more suited to evil things than love.  We play songs 
about black magic, but they are more likely to be against than for it.""(12)  

    By now, you're probably asking yourself who Black Widow is, right?  Then 
it's time for a little history:

        Sabbath, before they were known as Sabbath, had the same line-up but 
two earlier names.  The first one was Polka Tulk, which seemed sure to doom 
them to obscurity.(13)  The soon realized this and changed the group's name to 
Earth.  Now, Earth was a blues band at the end of the English blues boom.  As 
if that wasn't bad enough, they soon discovered that not only was there another 
group named Earth, but they had also released a single.  To avoid confusion, 
they changed their name again.(14)  But what made them decide on that name?  
Just ask Ozzy:  ""I just liked the name Black Sabbath because of the succession 
of vowel sounds.(15)  If that sounds ludicrous just consider this:  Sabbath was 
""...the first of the really committed, loud and heavy bands...""(16)  They 
needed a name to match the gut-wrenching power they were developing.  Tony knew 
that he wanted Sabbath to be noticed above all the rest of the British blues 
bands:  ""We wanted something of our own that we'd like and people would like.  
And we wanted something loud!""










    Tony didn't hate the blues.  He'd cut his teeth as a guitarist on the likes 
of The Shadows, Buddy Holly and Django Rheinhardt, developing his own style 
from there.  But he realized the group had no future in the blues:

        'We couldn't keep playing 12-bars forever.  We just got fed up with 
Earth music.  It was jazz, blues stuff.  It was good for practice but nothing 
else.'

    In the late 'Sixties, blues groups were a dime a dozen in Birmingham and 
interest was waning in the blues boom due to the glut of groups.  One man, by 
the name of Jim Simpson, had heard Earth around the Birmingham club circuit and 
understood what they were trying to do.  He decided to take them under his 
wing.  With the aid of his massive record collection, Jim expanded the group's 
horizons in the areas of jazz and blues.  He introduced them to artists like 
Wes Montgomery, Count Basie and Jimmy Rushing.  It was from Rushing in 
particular that they derived the repetitive riff style so readily noticeable in 
their later incarnation as Black Sabbath.

    The Count Basie influence is evidenced in the song ""Wicked World"" from the 
first album; Sabbath drummer Bill Ward uses a ""'sighing hi-hat'...in the manner 
of Basie's drummer Jo Jones.""










    The influence is subtle, almost subliminal.  Yet it is one which was not 
thought capable of hard, 'heavy' rock bands in the late 'Sixties.  Although Led 
Zeppelin and Jimi Hendrix also had their work steeped in blues and jazz 
derivations (Hendrix' ""Third Stone From the Sun"" and Zeppelin's version of 
Willie Dixon's ""I Can't Quit You Baby"" from their first album), neither was 
able to match the intense energy of Black Sabbath.  Iommi has always had a 
preference for music with an original, distinct style of its' own; as an 
example, he mentions guitarists Joe Pass and Alvin Lee as two of his strongest 
songwriting influences.

    It would also be necessary that Sabbath develop a unique, distinctive style 
and image of their own.  Though they had changed their name from Earth to Black 
Sabbath to avoid confusion with the other Earth; at the same time another group 
emerged by the name of Black Widow ""...who WERE profoundly influenced by the 
occult, had a male witch as a patron, and wrote pieces like ""Come to The 
Sabbat.""  Unfortunately, Sabbath was constantly reaping the benefits of Widow's 
publicity.

    Sabbath was a group that never minced words.  If they saw something as 
destructive, they would be sure to rub the listener's face it it.  They did not 
want their point to be missed.

    With their straightforward, sometimes brutal way of looking at things, they 
try to shock the listener's conscience back into awareness.  The imagery of 
""Hand of Doom"", from the Paranoid album, is candid and condemning; it is a 
strong statement against drug addiction and rightly so...

            YOU DON'T WANNA LEARN
            PRICE OF LIFE YOU CRY
            NOW YOU'RE GONNA DIE
            
            
    Many people felt the group's overall direction was pessimistic and had a 
negative effect on its listener's due to that.  ""Ozzy insisted that if people 
thought he was having a bad effect on the minds of young kids, they should go 
and watch the TV news where real murder and mayhem were a way of life, and 
shown night after night."" (18)

    Sabbath was never negative in their message; they were simply truthful 
about waht they saw as wrong in the world.  If you ""Strip away the horror 
stories, the imagery and the hysteria, (and) turn down the amps a notch...you 
have a well-rehearsed, solid blues and rock band, powered by a dedication to 
well defined objectives.""  On the top of the list of those objectives was 
truth; Sabbath never feared facing that truth squarely, regardless of what many 
people thought of them.

Long, long, time ago,
I can still remember,
When the local calls were ""free"".
And I knew if I paid my bill,
And never wished them any ill,
That the phone company would let me be...

But Uncle Sam said he knew better,
Split 'em up, for all and ever!
We'll foster competition:
It's good capital-ism!

I can't remember if I cried,
When my phone bill first tripled in size.
But something touched me deep inside,
The day... Bell System... died.

And we were singing...

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

Is your office Step by Step,
Or have you gotten some Crossbar yet?
Everybody used to ask...
Oh, is TSPS coming soon?
IDDD will be a boon!
And, I hope to get a Touch-Tone phone, real soon...

The color phones are really neat,
And direct dialing can't be beat!
My area code is ""low"":
The prestige way to go!

Oh, they just raised phone booths to a dime!
Well, I suppose it's about time.
I remember how the payphones chimed,
The day... Bell System... died.

And we were singing...

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

Back then we were all at one rate,
Phone installs didn't cause debate,
About who'd put which wire where...
Installers came right out to you,
No ""phone stores"" with their ballyhoo,
And 411 was free, seemed very fair!

But FCC wanted it seems,
To let others skim long-distance creams,
No matter 'bout the locals,
They're mostly all just yokels!

And so one day it came to pass,
That the great Bell System did collapse,
In rubble now, we all do mass,
The day... Bell System... died.

So bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

I drove on out to Murray Hill,
To see Bell Labs, some time to kill,
But the sign there said the Labs were gone.
I went back to my old CO,
Where I'd had my phone lines, years ago,
But it was empty, dark, and ever so forlorn...

No relays pulsed,
No data crooned,
No MF tones did play their tunes,
There wasn't a word spoken,
All carrier paths were broken...

And so that's how it all occurred,
Microwave horns just nests for birds,
Everything became so absurd,
The day... Bell System... died.

So bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

We were singing:

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
                             *

As the goddess Kali dances           Oh the ancient goddess Nerthus
With her worshippers in trances      From herself the Earth did birth us

And that's good enough for me!       But she's good enough for me!

It was good enough for Venus           We will sing our staves to Venus
She'd have sighed if she'd of seen us  We will sing our staves to Venus

And she's good enough for me!          But it's good enough for me!

And she's good enough for me!              And that's good enough for me!

                                             IMPERIUM COMPOUND    
                                             (Atenveldt Verses)

   Now here's a story, a little bit gory,
   A little bit happy, a little bit sad.
   About a drink called Imperium Compound
   And how the SCA's been had!                       

   Chorus: Oh we think, we think, we think,
           The King is a fink, a fink, a fink,
           A figure of respectability
           Rules the Kingdom thru Imperium Compound
           The results are plain to see!

   Mongol Hordemen, those free-living swordsmen
   Subverting the Kingdoms from underneath!
   Have no use for Imperium Compound
   Except perhaps to brush their teeth!

   AltChorus: Oh we fink, we fink, we fink,
              The Khan and the Kink, the Kink, the Kink,
              And the Board, their Great Senilities!
              The Western Irgun, drinks Imperium Compound
              And we're BACK, with results you'll see!    

   Lady Laurel, with Authority Royal,
   Passes and rejects our heraldry
   She needs a swig of Imperium Compound
   Then perhaps she'd deign to talk to me!            

   Lady Trude thought it her duty
   To turn a social wrong into a Right
   Proved her point with Imperium Compound
   And showed that Cheshire Cats can fight!  //and scratch//

   The Board of Directors styled themselves The Electors
   And another con they tried to swing
   Now the BoD drinks Imperium Compound
   So we no longer need a King!                        

   AltChorus: Oh the Bod, the BoD, the BoD,
              It thinks it is God, is God, is God,
              The figure of Supreme Authority!
              And if we O.D.'d on Imperium Compund
              there'd be no need for Royalty!          

   Oh, MEDIEVAL Net, we thought it was all wet
   With witty remarks, and other kinds of sass
   We'll feed our computers on Imperium Compound
   And BYTE the BoD right on its' righteous ass!         

   Good old Duncan was often drunken
   Chasing all the ladies fair
   He bathed himself in Imperium Compound
   Now he has a little savoir faire!                     

                    (more)


  ATEN IMPERIUM (cont.)

   Ioseph of Locksley, never changes his socks, he
   Runs around looking like a Cavalier,
   He stocked up on Imperium Compound
   And he has enough to last for years and years!        

   AltChorus: Oh they forgot, forgot, forgot
              The Locks-e-ly Plot, the Plot, the Plot!
              And it works the best when it is underground!
              It isn't a hassle for a green-and-white tassle
              They're the ones that BREW Imperium Compound!  

   Trelon of the Wood, he was very good, he
   Was a leader that had never been beat before;
   But Caid had Imperium Compound,
   And Imperial Roman Caid won the War!  //with help!//   

   In Tyr Ysgithr, it's regularly whispered there
   That the Kingdom is ruled over by a King    // What's THAT? //
   They're ""democratic"" and quite erratic....
   They've forgot the purpose of the whole damn thing!     

   King Sir Mark von, with his pretty white suit on,
   Rules the Kingdom both with Grace and Purity!
   He never touches Imperium Compound
   At least not where anyone else can see!               

   Duke Sir Deaton, was never beaten
   On the field, or in the drinking hall;
   At the Catbox War with Caid,
   Left thirty bodies piled against the wall!             

   Denis O'Titans was good at smitin'
   A Locksley Monster in every single way!
   Drank a little Imperium Compound
   And ATE Deaton's sword that day  // No! REALLY! //

                          WTP-0002C

        Last night I had the strangest dream in this bleak century
        I dreamed that people the world around believed in Chivalry

        I dreamed I saw a Kingly Crown enshrined in laurel leaves
        with Grace and Joy and Purity attendant at his feet

        I dreamed I saw the perfect Knight receive his accolade
        and minstrels sang and children laughed in some soft forest glade

        I dreamed I saw the finest thing that ever man could make
        grow great and strong and undefiled: Pray God I never wake!

        Last night I had the strangest dream in this bleak century
        I dreamed that people the world around believed in Chivalry

                Locksley Monsters never yield
                on the field of battle
                strike the helm and bash the shield
                make their eyeteeth rattle
                Bodies on the ground will lie
                bones will burst in sunder

            There is a man who we know well that does the best he can
            but he's displayed in armour made of reticulated garbage cans!

            He looks so fine and fair and strong, oh how he plays the man
            and how it's prized, those galvanized, reticulated garbage cans

            The noblest Roman of them all, a good Praetorian
            a combatant who wears no pants, judst reticulated garbage cans!

            Like old Horatius at the Bridge, like the Legions of Valerian
            (O dearie me: those LOVELY knees!)
            and those reticulated garbage cans!

2.           The next time I tried it, the Heralds said to me

            ""We changed the forms, and it violates the Rule of
             Three"".

3.           The third time I tried, and the Heralds said to me, 

            ""We upped the fees, we changed the forms, and it
             violates the Rule of Three"".

4.           Another time I tried and the Heralds said to me,
 
            ""We haven't got it, we upped the fees, we changed the 
             forms, and it violates the Rule of Three"".

5.           The fifth time I tried it, the Heralds said to me,  

            ""In a decision rendered by the College of Arms on
             August 1st, A.S. V it was decided that this style of
             heraldic design was not appropriate to the aims and 
             intentions of the Corporate Body. Holy! Holy! Holy! ""

 note: verse 5 is delivered in an extremely fast, mono-
       tone, similiar to a Gregorian Chant.

           "" ....we haven't got it, we upped the fees, we changed the forms,
             and it violates the Rule of Three.""

6.           I tried it a sixth time, and the Heralds said to me,

            ""We changed the rules, &c""

7.           A seventh time I tried and, the Heralds said to me,

            ""It's against the Rule of Tincture, we changed the
             rules, &c""

8.           I tried it once again and the heralds said to me,

            ""It's not a Period design, It's against the Rule of Tincture, We
             changed the rules, &c""

    Heralds Said To Me (cont.)

9.           I sent it in once more, and the Heralds said to me,

            ""We changed the rules again, It's not a Period design,
             it's against the Rule of Tincture, we changed the
             rules, &c""

10. (sung in cold anger)
             The LAST time I sent my device, the Heralds said to me

    (sung in a state of SMUG)
             ""Someone else has got it, &c""




              (nb: every single one of these reasons has been used by the
              CoA, at one point or another, to reject perfectly good

   or: There may be Lice on all you Knice, but there ain't no Lice on me

           Once there was a Barony howling in the wilderness
           nestled in the Valley where the River doesn't flow
           and the folks were driven buggy by the insects in the Revel Hall
           Authenticity is wonderful, but this doesn't go!

                   Bugs on the Baroness, bugs on the Baroness!
                   That was the cry that you heard all the day
                   and the scratching can be heard from Ysgithr to Ered Sul
                   why did we come here? Let's go away!

           See them all a scratching, nestled in their armour tight
           the fleas have a melee team that's challenging the field!
           call Truly Nolen! Someone's gotta help us out!
           the crabs are nesting in our helms but we'll never yield!

                   (chorus)

           Dawn comes a-breaking, the bugs have won the Coronet...
           flea-infested Conan-clones in piles upon the lawn
           where is the Barony? The bugs have eaten everyone...
           termites got the stick-jocks, and all their sticks are gone!

      What the use of wearing panties
      whalebone corsets of your Auntie's
      boxer shorts and other scanties
      best of all is nude
      there's such fun in going bra-less
      now that it's no longer lawless
      'specially if your figure's flawless
      best of all is nude
      nude is what you're born in
      shirts are never torn in
      underwear and lacy flimsies, garter belts and other whimsies
      yards of itchy cloth to put your form in
      ducks all do it, maidens rue it
      even ancient Picts in Britain blue it
      going naked's how to do it
      best of all is nude!

      If your garters aren't elastic
      tie them up in knots fantastic
      (panty hose is something drastic!)
      best of all is nude!
      If you're tired of wearing clotheses
      shed your garment 'mongst the roses
      never mind the old bluenoses
      best of all is nude!
      Nude is best for ducking!
      Worst for horses bucking!
      Moonlit nights will see such sights
          that are very best for fooling round
                              .....and elbows!
      Nudity is grand to see
       a well-known antidote to virginity
      take your clothes off and you'll see:
      best of all is nude!

                   spun three times and said with a sigh
                   hadn't been for the Runes had his other eye!

                   prettiest thing I've ever seen
                   she went down underneath the hill
                   and came back out of her own free will

                   Brian Boru, on Irish ground
                   walked three times the Island round
                   Norsemen came lookin for a fight
                   just another Irish Saturday night!

                   got six feet of English ground

                   the Legion with it's Eagles bright
                   marched into the Pictish night
                   met them there upon the sand
                   gave em up to the Wicker Man!

                   eight-legged steed and hound of Hel

                   the Circle goes where no man knows

                                  by the fire burning bright
                                  came to know his heart's delight!

                    WEAPONS AT THE DOOR

 Being a Polemic concerning the alleged Custom of the West Kingdom concerning 
 checking your Weapons at the Door of the Revel Hall. As the Satire is the 
 Weapon of the Bard, this said Polemic is to be checked at the Door, along with 
 swords, knives, redheaded Ladies and other such Deadly Things.....

         As I roved out to Western Lands to take the Western Air
         I went into a Revel Hall and I saw a Twelfth Night there
         but I was halted at the gate by a Privy Consellor
                 (that's the man who tells the King of the West how to go to
                  the bath room!)
         who told me I would have to check my Weapons at the door

         As I, in my astonishment, stood hung on tenter-pegs
         a Knight came in whose Prouess hung down between his legs
         the Doorman grabbed a greatsword and he struck the Knight full sore
         and gave him a reciept; he left his weapon at the door!

         a Bard was next whose goodly Voice has entertained us all
         but he, too, was prevented from entering the Hall
         and told he could not carry deadly weapons on the floor
         he left his Voice and Harp among the weapons at the door

         a Master entered graciously, a man we all know well
         who holds a 3rd Dan Black Belt, tho this he'd never tell
         the Master struggled valiantly, the Master cursed and swore
         but he left his hands, and feet, as weapons at the door

         the company was jovial, altho a bit dismayed
         for lack of proper cutlery, down to the smallest blade
         for even teeth and fingernails, each can be used in War
         were cut, and pulled, and left behind, as weapons at the door!

         And has their King not loyal Knights that He must be afraid
         of brawling in his Hall and of Assassin's bloody blade?
         the Rights of Men to carry Arms at least WE'VE not foreswore
         and a POX on them that made the Rule of Weapons at the Door!

                           THE STREETS OF ANN ARBOR

               As I walked out thru the streets of Ann Arbor
               as I walked out thru Ann Arbor one day
               I spied a young Mongol all dressed in white linen
               all dressed in white linen and cold as the clay

               I then spied another, done in on the sidewalk
               along with just about six dozen more
               their wounds were all gaping, from mace and from braoadsword
               from claymore and cannon, all dripping with gore

               what caused this grave carnage, I cried to the Monglos
               oh pray what's the reason for this awful sight
               my answer came slowly from under the corpse-pile
               ""It seems that our bark is much worse than our bite.....""

               the answer continued from pale lips a-shaking
               we sang all our songs and believed them as true
               the Dark Horde could never be beaten in battle
               we thought this was what all good Mongols could do...

               we went down to Atenveldt all for to plunder
               ""too large to defend"" was our song every night
               but Atenveldt's different from East, West or Middle
               there, even the bushes have learned how to bite!

               the Clann stole our ponies, the Scraelings our foodstuffs
               we ran into axes in AtenViking hands
               our maidens ran off with one Richard of Arkham
               and we're all that's left to return to our lands

               MacChluarains and Monsters, Lockehaven and Foxmoor
               that Kingdom is BIG and its' fighters are MEAN!
               we fought and we lost, and fled back to Ann Arbor
               we all came back home with results that you've seen

               keep away from that Land with its' cactus and marshes
               it's no place for Mongols who are bent on War
               they count their blows well, but they strick them yet better
               he crawled into his Yurt, and fell, dead, on the floor.....

                       SONG OF THE THREE
             copyright 1981 W. J. Bethancourt III
                            C. A. Bethancourt III
       tune: the song of the Cowardly Lion, Tin Woodsman and Scarecrow
             in the movie version of the Wizard of Oz

        (Enter the Scarecrow, who singeth:)

        My wife is always nagging; my Prowess it is lagging
        I can't do anything
        she has got a reason, but revenge is out of season
        Oh I wish I could be King!

        If I just had the Crown on, I'd always have a frown on
        and the Barons on a string
        Heads they would be rolling, the Board would be cajoling
        Oh if only I was King!

        I am very fed up with the way this group is set up
        Oh I'd change everything!
        they are so high and mighty with the way that they do fight-ey
        Oh, someday I'll be King!

        Tho my wife is melancholic, and very...vitriolic
        she's a wasp without a sting!
        I'd have to supervise her with a pack of tranquilizers
        If I only was a King......

        (the Tin Woodsman joineth him, and singeth:)

        I grew up kind of cocky, and rather big, and stocky
        and straight as any rod
        on the field I'm a battallion, with the Ladies I'm a stallion
        ...Oh they'd better make me God!

        The other boys are jealous they say I'm over-zealous
        they'd do better to applaud
        the things that I am giving to this Dream that we are living
        oh I wish they'd make me God!

        They say that I'm conceited, but I'm just badly treated
        by people and by BoD
        just think of what they're missing by My Majesty dismissing
        Oh they'd better make me God!

        (the Cowardly Lion creepeth forth, and singeth:)

        Oh I could be a fighter, a great and mighty smiter
        and be the perfect knight
        it's a great and nasty shame, and everyone's to blame
        oh I wish that I could fight!

        Song of the Three (cont.)

        I could be a Cavalier drinking wine and ale and beer
        and be a gorgeous sight
        but it would cost me too much money so it isn't very funny
        oh I wish that I could fight!                               

        Let me at 'em on the field, I would surely make them yield
        to my Power and my Might
        with rattan, shinai and rapier they would nevermore escape here
        If they'd only let me fight

                She was afraid to come out to the Tourney
                She was worried that ""something might show..""
                She was afraid to come out to the Tourney
                And the poor thing did NOT want to go...

                  (2 - 3 - 4, tell the people what she wore!)

                One day in the Kingdom of the Middle
                It happened at a Tourney one day:
                The Mongols invaded the Middle
                But the Middle did not want to play...

                  (eins - zwei - drei, but the Dark Horde wouldn't die!)

                  It was an itsy bitsy tiny teenie Nauseating Mongol weenie

          Some folks call me many names, others call me crazy
          Tom O'Bedlam's son am I, for my mind is hazy!
          I'd rather sing a song than work (if it's not too phrasey!)
          Lengthy rhymes don't bother me....truth to tell: I'm lazy!

          Yang, your yurt is very nice, and your Horde is smelly,
          And I'm sure that yak-meat will nicely fill one's belly!
          But remember this one line, or you're not worth jelly:
          FIRST you plunder, THEN you burn! That's how to be rakehelly!

          My Lady Lorelei your eyes do drive me to distraction
          And the lovely Care-Cheri causes....petrifaction!
          But I, and they, quite taken are, so I can't take action...
          Therefore, Ladies, fill my cup; I'll drink to stupefaction!

          Now Atenveldt your fighters, all, are most good and gentle
          And the Ladies, bless 'em all, are most ornamental!
          But that little Nikki-Toad....has me sentimental
          Though with boffer in her hand she is argumental!

          This stupid little song, m'lords, is mostly sung in Latin
          By the Goliards, of course, from vespers clear to matins!
          But I prefer a coarser cloth over silk or satins
          English is more understood, mine enemies to flatten!

          Good People all, I've made my Song, its' music's well-recited
          But my voice could use some work; the flowers it has blighted!
          It's rude and rusty, grim and bad, and squeaky like a door-hinge,
          But I'm a better Bard than you: I found a rhyme for ""orange!""

                      by William Poundstone
                              1983

     Two mentalities are at work here: 1960s rock fans and 1980s
fundamentalist Christians. The idea of phonographically concealed
messages dates from the Paul McCartney death scare of 1969. For
hard-core types, the secret-message rumors never really died. Avid
rock fans have auditioned ever album release since the late 1960s
for hidden nuances. Backward messages, barely audible messages,
and messages on one stereo track only have been alleged. At the
other end of the sociosensual spectrum, fundamentalist Christians
have gotten into the act. TV programs such as PRAISE THE LORD and
THE 700 CLUB have propagated rumors of a satanic plot in the
recording industry, no less, in which various albums conceal
""backward-masked"" demonic murmurings. If THAT sounds too spacey to
be taken seriously, consider that it was the fundamentalist groups
who were behind House Resolution 6363, a bill introduced in the
U.S. House of Representatives by Robert K. Dornan (R., Calif.) in
1982 to label all suspect records: ""WARNING: THIS RECORD CONTAINS
BACKWARD MASKING THAT MAKES A VERBAL STATEMENT WHICH IS AUDIBLE
WHEN THIS RECORD IS PLAYED BACKWARD AND WHICH MAY BE PERCEPTIBLE
AT A SUBLIMINAL LEVEL WHEN THIS RECORD IS PLAYED FORWARD."" In
February 1983, the Arkansas State Senate passed a similar record-
labeling bill by a vote of 86 to 0.
     Contributing to the quasi-occult status of these rumors is
the difficulty of checking them out on home audio equipment. You
pretty much have to take someone else's word for it, or dismiss
the rumors out of hand.
     From a technical standpoint, there are four simple ways to
conceal a verbal message on a recording. The most obvious is to
record the message at a very low volume. The message may then be
recovered by turning the volume up while playing the record or
tape. If the message is faint enough, though, noise levels of home
equipment may garble it. If the accompanying music or lyrics are
loud enough, or if the message itself is indistinct or
electronically modified, it may be hard to hear on any equipment.
     A second gimmick is to record a message on one stereo track
only. Records and tapes have two independent recordings, of
course, normally played simultaneously for stereo effect. On a
record, each stereo track occupies on one side of the V-shaped
groove for the needle. On a tape, the tracks are recorded in
parallel lanes of the magnetic material. The two tracks are called
""right"" and ""left"" after the stereo speakers they will play on.
Otherwise, the tracks are interchangeable -- the sound mixer can
put anything he or she wants on each track. A message on one track
can be masked by simultaneous loud music or lyrics on the opposite
track. With normal stereo balance (or mono equipment) the loud
track drowns out the message track. At home, single-track messages
can be recovered by adjusting the stereo balance so that only the
desired track plays. Sometimes this trick also makes indistinct
words clearer. Even if the words are not exclusively on one track,
they may happen to be more audible on one track.
     A message could be recorded at a speed different from the
rest of the record. Then the record would have to be played faster
or slower than usual to recover the message. Unless the message
was at one of the standard speeds (say, 45 rpm on a 33 1/3 rpm
record), it could not be played normally on home equipment.
     The fourth and most commonly alleged trick is to record a
verbal message backward. Reversed speech has several unexpected
features. One is that syllables are not a constant in the reversal
process. A one-syllable word can have two or three syllables when
played backward. Thus ""number nine"" in the Beatles' REVOLUTION 9
reverses to ""Turn me on, dead man"" (or something like it), a jump
from three to five syllables.
     There is no simple way to predict what a word or phrase will
sound like reversed. Obviously, you can't just reverse the
letters.
     Reversed messages are difficult to recover at home. Record
turntables are not built to go backwards. Some have a neutral
setting, in which the pickup and amplifier remain active and you
can turn the record backward by hand. But hardly anyone has a
stead enough hand to produce satisfactory results.
     With patience, it is possible to reverse a cassette
recording. Transfer the music from the original record or tape
onto a blank tape cassette. Place the cassette flat on a table.
Draw our the part of the tape with the suspected message and snip
it off at both ends. Hold the tape segment horizontally. Rotate it
180 degrees, keep it horizontal at all times. This turns the tape
end for end. Splice the reversed tape segment back onto the two
loose ends of the cassette with strong adhesive tape. Reel the
tape back inside the cassette. The sliced segment will play
backward on an ordinary cassette player.
     I rented a recording studio to test the secret-message
rumors. New copiies of the records in question were transcribed on
a quarter-inch master tape. Where rumor alleged that a single
stereo track contained a message, right and left stereo tracks
were transcribed separately. Records with alleged inaudible
messages were treated similarly. To test claims of reversed
messages, recordings on the master tape were edited out and
spliced in backward. Twenty cuts or portions of cuts from sixteen
albums were tested.


""Another One Bites the Dust""
Queen, THE GAME

Rumor: When played backward, the lyrics say, ""It's fun to smoke
marijuana.""
Findings: There is something that sounds like ""It's fun to smoke
marijuana"" in the reversed music. It is repeated over and over. It
might be rendered no less faithfully, however, as ""sfun to scout
mare wanna."" This ""message"" is the reversal of the song title,
which is repeated as a line in the song.
     Let's make a distinction between engineered and phonetic
reversals. When an artist records a verbal statement, reverses it
by turning the tape end for end, mixes the reversed statement onto
a master tape, and has records and tapes produced from the master,
that is an engineered reversal. When the phonetic properties of
song lyrics are such that they can be reversed to sound like
something else, that is a phonetic reversal.
     ""It's fun to smoke marijuna"" is clearly a phonetic reversal.
The lyrics are perfectly plain played forward (""Another one bites
the dust""), no so plain played backward (""sfun to scout mare
wanna""). With an engineered reversal, the opposite should hold
true: gibberish forward, clear as a bell backward. Some are
prepared to believe that phonetic reversals are just as
intentional as engineered reversals -- that the songwriter
painstakinginly planned the phonetic double-entendre. In the
absence of confirming evidence, that just doesn't wash. It's too
easy to find coincidences. If, for example, the letters of the
alphabet are recited in conventional fashion (Ay, Bee, Cee, etc.)
and reversed, at least five sound like English language words. D
reverses to ""eden,"" F becomes ""pray,"" S becomes ""say,"" V becomes
""even,"" and Z becomes ""easy."" ""It's fun to smoke marijuana"" is
likewise a coincidence.


""A Child is Coming""
Jefferson Starship, BLOWS AGAINST THE EMPIRE

Rumor: When played backward, ""son of Satan.""
Findings: Another phonetic coincidence. The repeated ""It's getting
better"" reverses to an iffy ""son of Satan,"" the ""of"" drawn out and
the ""Satan"" strongly accented on the first syllable.


""Eldorado""
Electric Light Orchestra, ELDORADO

Rumor: When played backward, ""He is the nasty one/ Christ, you're
infernal/ It is said we're dead men/ Everyone who has the mark
will live.""
Findings: Coincidence. The supposed message lurks around the line
""On a voyage of no return to see."" Reversed, this passage becomes
the expected syllable salad -- no one hearing it would describe it
as anything but reversed music. Only if you listen while reading
along with what you're supposed to hear will you get anything. The
rumored version of the message is somewhat fudged. The passage
sounds more like ""He's to nasty one/ Christ you are, Christ,
you're fernal/ There wiss uh, we're dead men..."" There is no ""in""
in what is taken to be ""infernal."" The line that is supposed to be
""Everyone who has the mark will live"" isn't even close, though the
syllable count is right.


""Shoo Be Doo""
The Cars, CANDY-O

Rumor: When played backward, the word ""Satan"" repeated
approximately eleven times.
Findings: Coincidence. The rumor refers to the reversal of the ""Shoo
be doo, shoo be doo, shoo be doo..."" near the end of the song. Given
the mysterious logic of reversed phonemes, these three-syllable units
can be hard as a repeated two-syllable word. The word sounds a little
like ""Satan.""


""Snowblind""
Styx, PARADISE THEATER

Rumor: According to a mimeographed list of suspect records distributed
by Congressman Dornan, the words ""Satan move through our voices"" when
played backwards.
Findings: Negative. Despite repeated listenings, it was not even
possible to identify the part of the reversed track that Dornan et al.
are talking about.


""Stairway to Heaven""
Led Zeppelin, untitled, a.k.a. STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN

Rumor: In reverse, ""I live for Satan... The Lord turns me off...
There's no escaping it... Here's to my sweet Satan... There's power in
Satan... He will give you 666.""
Findings: Coincidence. If you listen very carefully to the ""And it
makes me wonder"" lines in reverse, you'll hear something approaching
""There's no escaping it."" A better description is ""There's no escape
do."" Knock of the last syllable, and you have ""There's no escape,"" a
complete, intelligible sentence in reverse. It's there, all right, but
it's not an unlikely enough coincidence to -- well, make you wonder.
      The ""Satan"" in ""I live for Satan"" is good and clear. The ""I live
for"" part isn't. The other alleged lines are unremarkable. All are
phonetic reversals of the entirely lucid forward lyrics and obviously
just accidents.


""When Electricity Came to Arkansas""
Black Oak Arkansas, BLACK OAK ARKANSAS and RONCH AND ROLL

Rumor: In reverse, ""Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan. He is God. He
is God.""
Findings: The BLACK OAK ARKANSAS cut was reversed. Again, pairs of
reversed syllables are being freely interpreted as ""Satan."" ""He is
God"" was not identifiable.


""Rain""
The Beatles, HEY JUDE

Rumor: Unintelligible lyrics at the end are reversed.
Findings: A true engineered reversal and not really a secret. ""Rain""
seems to have been the first popular recording to incorporate an
obviously reversed lyric. The story is that John Lennon accidentally
spliced the last part of the song in backward and liked the effect.
When reversed, the strange-sounding vocals at the end become
intelligible as a reprise starting with the drawn-out word
""sunshine.""
      The reversal is less apparent to the casual listener than it
might be because the accompanying music is not reversed. The ending
fits in smoothly with the rest of the song, the vocals suggesting a
foreign language.


""Fire on High""
Electric Light Orchestra, FACE THE MUSIC

Rumor: When played backward, ""The music is reversible, but time --
turn back!""
Findings: ""Fire on High"" is instrumental. About twenty-six seconds
into the music, scrambled speech is heard. It is mostly louder than
the accompanying music and begins with a two-syllable unit repeated
several times. The seeming speech lasts for about fourteen seconds.
      Reversing the music confirms that there is a true, engineered
message. In reverse, a voice (Jeff Lynne's?) says, ""The music is
reversible, but time -- turn back! Turn back! Turn back! Turn back!""
All the words are clear and unambiguous. Anyone comparing this to the
alleged reversal on ELO's ""Eldorado"" will have no trouble telling
which is genuine.


""Goodbye Blue Sky""
Pink Floyd, THE WALL

Rumor: In reverse, ""You have discovered the secret message.""
Findings: The ""secret message"" is at the very end of the instrumental
passage following the ""Goodbye Blue Sky"" vocals. It comes just before
the words ""What shall we do"" at the start of the song that is
identified as ""Empty Spaces"" on the record label and as ""What shall we
do now?"" on the record sleeve. Played forward, the message is less
apparent than the FACE THE MUSIC reversal: A reasonably attentive
listener might play THE WALL through and not catch it. It suggests
speech not quite close enough to be overheard. In context this is not
unusual because the ""Goodbye Blue Sky"" instrumental passage includes
""airport noises"" and other sound effects. A loud climax in the music
further masks the unintelligible voice.
      When played backward, the voice (Roger Waters?) plainly intones,
""Congratulations, you have just discovered the secret message. Please
send your answer to old Pink, care of the funny farm..."" As the voice
fades out, there may be another word -- perhaps ""Chalfonte or
""Chelsea"" -- after ""funny farm.""


""Heavy Metal Poisoning""
Styx, KILROY WAS HERE

Rumor: A red sticker on the KILROY WAS HERE cover warns, ""By order of
the Majority for Musical Morality, this album contains secret backward
messages...""
Findings: This is a case of second-generation backward-masking. Styx'
PARADISE THEATER did not contain a backward message, though a lot of
people said it did. So Styx has included a sure enough backward
message on KILROY WAS HERE. It is at the very beginning of ""Heavy
Metal Poisoning."" The reversed speech last about three seconds. There
is no musical background. The words reverse to ""Annuit coeptis. Novus
ordo seclorum."" This is the Latin motto encircling the pyramid on the
back of a dollar bill. The usual translation: ""God has favored our
undertakings. A new order of the ages.""
      The cover sticker's ""Majority for Musical Morality"" is a
fictitious Falwellesque group in the KILROY WAS HERE video. Although
the sticker suggests a plurality of ""messages,"" only one was found.


Space between ""I'm So Tired"" and ""Blackbird""
The Beatles, untitled, a.k.a. THE WHITE ALBUM

Rumor: A reversed message. At the time of the Paul-is-dead stories,
the segue from ""I'm So Tired"" to ""Blackbird"" was offered as evidence.
It was held to contain John Lennon's voice, reveresed, saying ""Paul is
dead, miss him, miss him, miss him."" That interpretation seems
unlikely now, but there is a mysterious low muttering between the
songs.
Findings: The mumbling is actually just to the ""I'm So Tired"" side of
the shiny ""space"" between cuts on the record. Each of the stereo
tracks was recorded separately, twice, and a copy of each track was
reversed. This produced four versions of the two-second passage: right
forward, left forward, right reversed, and left reversed. All were
equally unintelligible. It was not even apparent whether the voice is
forward or reversed. Nor could John Lennon be identified as the
speaker. There are nine or ten syllables. The first six (when played
forward) are a two-syllable unit repeated three times. There is little
or no difference betwen the stereo tracks. Any claimed interpretation
of the sounds seems doubtful.


""Strawberry Fields Forever""
The Beatles, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR

Rumor: It was, of course, claimed that John Lennon says ""I buried
Paul"" at the end. (It's forward, at the very end after the music
fades to complete silence, returns, and starts to fade out again.)
But Lennon told ROLLING STONE that the words are ""cranberry
sauce.""
Findings: They are ""cranberry sauce."" The ""sauce""/""Paul"" part is
indistinct, but the first syllable sounds a lot more like ""cran""
than ""I.""


""Baby You're a Rich Man""
The Beatles, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR

Rumor: On one of the tracks the line ""Baby you're a rich man too""
is sung as ""Baby you're a rich fag Jew,"" a dig at Brian Epstein.
Or some think it's ""rich fat Jew"" and claim it as evidence of
Beatle anti-Semitism.
Findings: Negative. The two stereo tracks are nearly identical.
It's always possible to hear words as similar-sounding words, but
basically, the lyrics jibe with the published version.


""Revolution 9""
The Beatles, untitled, a.k.a. THE WHITE ALBUM

Rumor: Various reversed and/or one-track speech. The reversal of
""Number nine"" to ""Turn me on, dead man"" has pretty much been
discounted as coincidence (though it appears on Congressman
Dornan's list).
Findings: Distinction between lyrics and any hidden message blurs
on ""Revolution 9."" The eight-minute cut is a montage of sounds
collected by John Lennon and Yoko Ono. It includes discordant
music, radio broadcasts, sirens, applause, gunfights, sports
cheers, the crackling of a fire, screams, a baby gurgling, a choir
singing, and much that cannot be identified. For this
investigation, ""Revolution 9"" was transcribed four times, twice on
each stereo channel. One copy of each of the tracks was reversed.
The four resulting versions were compared with each other and
against the original two-channel version.
     ""Revolution 9"" contains a lot of talking. Played in stereo,
forward, the longest stretch of understandable speech is probably
an announcer saying, ""...every one of them knew that as time went
by they'd get a little bit older and a little bit slower...""
     One believable instance of reversed speech occurs: someone
saying ""Let me out! Let me out!"" (once held to represent McCartney
in his totaled Aston-Martin). Two iffy reversals occur on the
backward recording of the right stereo track:""She used to be
assistant"" and ""There were two men..."" Neither is clear enough or
long enough to be convincing. Some of the music, including the
recurring theme, sounds more natural in reverse.
     ""Turn me on, dead man"" is a typical phonetic reversal. The
forward ""number nine"" (repeated throughout the cut) is clear; the
reversal is slurred -- something like ""turn me on dedmun."" It has
been claimed that ""number nine"" must be pronounced with a British
accent or with some careful inflection in order to reverse to
""Turn me on, dead man."" This seems not to be so. As an experiment,
three American-accent renderings of ""number nine"" were reversed.
All sound about as much like ""Turn me on, dead man"" as the record
did. Like the other phonetic reversals, ""Turn me on, dead man""
must be considered a coincidence.
     Much of ""Revolution 9"" is on one stereo track only. Near the
end a voice says ""A fine natural imbalance...the Watusi...the
twist...Eldorado...Eldorado."" ""A fine natural imbalance"" is on the
right track only, though the words that follow are in stereo. One
of the longer bits of speech -- ""Who could tell what he was
saying? His voice was low and his [unintelligible] was high and
his eyes were low"" -- is clear on the left track, a bare whisper
on the right.
     There is a stereophonically concealed ""secret message"" on
""Revolution 9."" The words are on the right track. They begin about
four minutes, fifty-eight seconds into the cut and run for about
twenty-two seconds. They are not likely to be noticed in stereo
because of the much louder left track. The sound of applause
begins on the left track at about five minutes, one second into
the cut. Deafening noises -- the clapping, sirens, music --
continue on the left track until five minutes, forty seconds. It
may or may not have been Lennon's and Ono's intention to conceal
the spoken passage. Given the haphazard quality of ""Revolution 9,""
the concealment may have been accidental. To recover the passage,
the left track must be switched off. The right track can then be
heard to contain a sound like a stopwatch ticking, behind these
words:

     So the wife called, and we better go to see a
     surgeon....[A SCREAM MUFFLES A LINE THAT SOUNDS LIKE
     Well, what with the prices, the prices have snowballed,
     no wonder it's closed.] ...So any and all, we went to
     see the dentist instead, who gave him a pair of teeth,
     which wasn't any good at all. So instead of that he
     joined the bloody navy and went to sea.
                      by William Poundstone
                              1986

     There really are backward messages on rock albums. And the
controversy over ""backward masking"" and ""porn rock"" has inspired a
whole new spate of messages. There may have been more genuine
backward messages in the past few years than ever before.
     The backward message controversy is usually traced to the
1960s and John Lennon's avant-garde sound mixing on such tracks as
""Revolution 9"" on the Beatles' WHITE ALBUM. Lennon probably wasn't
trying to conceal a message so much as create an interesting
sound.
     The matter might have ended right there had it not been for
the Paul McCartney death rumor. College kids tried playing Beatles
records forward, backward, and at various speeds to find ""clues""
to McCartney's fate. In the process they found snippets of speech
from Lennon's experiments. Even after McCartney was found safe and
sound in Scotland, some listeners continued to look for hidden
messages.
     Somehow, fundamentalist Christian groups became convinced
(ca. 1982) that the alleged messages were commercials for devil
worship. Not a single indisputable satanic message has turned up,
but there were scattered attempts to ban or label certain albums.
In 1986 one fundamentalist group announced that the theme song for
the old MR. ED TV show contains the word ""Satan"" when played
backward.)
     Ironically, the publicity accorded nonexistent messages has
inspired several artists -- among them porn rock hearing witness
Frank Zappa -- to hide real background messages in their music.
It's easy to do.
     The performer speaks or sings the message normally, then
reverses the tape, which is mixed into the soundtrack. This is all
accomplished simply enough at any recording studio.
     What's not so simple is playing it back. More home record,
cassette, and compact disk players won't play backward. You can
turn a record backward with a pencil eraser, but it's not good for
the needle or the turntable. The only way to reproduce the message
with full fidelity is to use a professional-quality reel-to-reel
tape player and splice the tape in backward.
     We used the facilities of KLOS radio in Los Angeles to
reverse some recent records containing true backward messages.


""Secret Messages""
Electric Light Orchestra, SECRET MESSAGES

ELO's ELDORADO album was among those alleged to contain satanic
backward masked messages. A patient listening to ELDORADO played
backward reveals no such messages. You hear only what you ought to
hear -- the reversed lyrics of the songs, which sound nothing like
the ""messages"" claimed to be there. In the wake of such
allegations, ELO did put an (innocuous) backward message on their
FACE THE MUSIC album. Perhaps they thought this would show how
silly the allegations were. Instead, the backward-masking people
seized on this as proof that the other ""messages"" were real. In
the latest volley, ELO has named an album after the controversy.
     In Britain (where the backward-masking issue is viewed as an
American eccentricity), the cover of SECRET MESSAGES has a mock
warning label to youth about the hidden label. Word of the albums'
impending release in the United States caused enough of a furor to
chill CBS Records into deleting the cover blurb.
     The reversed message is easy to find. It's at the beginning
of the first song, which is itself called ""Secret Messages."" You
can hear reversed speech when you play the record normally. A
voice intones ""secret messages"" -- forward -- in the middle of the
reversed speech, lest anyone dare be so unhip as to not know
what's going on.
     We transferred a new copy of SECRET MESSAGES to reel-to-reel
tapes and played it backward. The backward message goes: ""WELCOME
TO THE BIG SHOW/ WELCOME TO THE BIG SHOW.""
     That's it.


""Ya Hozna""
Frank Zappa, THEM OR US

""Ya Hozna,"" a six-minute composition on the first record of the
THEM OR US double album, is ENTIRELY backward. The albums' inner
cover, which includes lyrics for the other songs, says, ""backwards
vocal -- you figure it out"" of this cut. It credits Frank and Moon
Zappa, George Duke, and Napoleon Murphy Brock as vocalists.
     Played forward, ""Ya Howza"" sounds like a record played
backward -- reasonably so. The vocals are prominent and
unintelligible. Moon Zappa's voice is curiously recognizable, even
in reverse. It is hard to tell whether the music was recorded
forward or backward.
     When ""Ya Howza"" is played in reverse, you discover that the
music is virtually a palindrome -- it sounds about the same
forward and backward. The voices are all backward. In some cases
they have been modified electronically. Many of the words are
muffled. Even after repeated careful listening on both stereo
tracks, it is difficult to make out many of the lyrics. It doesn't
help that some of the words seem to be stream-of-consciousness
nonsense. Some of the unintelligible stuff sounds like opera.
     Starting at the beginning of the reversed tape -- the end of
the forward tape -- the clearer vocals go like this: ""I am the
heaven, I am the water."" This is in a hymnlike register. ""You are
a lonely little girl./ But your mommy and your daddy hold you."" A
singsong synthesizer voice.
     The most interesting part of the lyrics is an intermittently
orgasmic rap in Moon Zappa's Valley Girl voice. There are three
short monologues:

I'm like green!
I'm like squat!
I'm like soul!
Repeat, like soul!
I'm like pull, push,
Okay, like slow, slow.

You're never too old
Like slow, like slow, like slow
Okay, I like it.


All right, faster, faster,
Go, do it, do it twice,
Yeah, that feels good,
I'm looking great,
Yeah, fer shure!
Like, no way!


""No Anchovies, Please""
J. Geils Band, LOVE STINKS

""No Anchovies, Please"" is a novelty song, really a narration with
sound effects, about a woman who is kidnapped after eating
anchovies. She is taken to a ""foreign-speaking"" country. The sound
effect of the foreign tongue seems reversed. When you do play it
in reverse, it becomes: ""It doesn't take a genius to know the
difference between chicken shit and chicken salad.""


""Darling Nikki""
Prince, PURPLE RAIN

""Darling Nikki,"" cited as porn rock before Congress, is about a
dominatrix in a hotel lobby masturbating with a magazine. In part,
the complaint was that the album cover (flowers, and Prince on a
motorcycle) wasn't explicit enough to warn kids of the suggestive
lyrics. Senator Paula Hawkins apparently was not aware of a
backward message hidden in ""Darling Nikki."" The last thirty-five
seconds of the song is gibberish. The music changes abruptly and
becomes a repeated glottal sound. Then a two-syllable sound is
repeated twice, something like ""heaven, heaven."" Unintelligible
speech follows. At the end is a sound reminiscent of rain or bacon
frying , and wind sounds.
     Played backward, the message becomes:

     Hello, how are you?
     I'm fine 'cause I know that the Lord is coming soon.
     Coming, coming soon.

     It is clearly Prince and the Revolution singing this. The
words are clear but the intonation is funny -- the linger on some
words. Perhaps this is to make the reversed message you hear
playing the record normally a little less conspicuous.
     This is a weird reversal of the supposed secret message
menace. Raunchy forward lyrics conceal a religious secret message.


""Judas Kiss""
Petra, MORE POWER TO YOU

Petra is an obscure group that sings religious songs to a rock
beat. As further proof that things have gone full circle, the
backward-masking controversy prompted Petra to include a wholesome
backward message on their MORE POWER TO YOU album. It is in the
transition between two songs, just before ""Judas Kiss."" Clearly
audible gibberish reverses to this (the husky voice a cross
between George Beverly Shea and Dee Snider): ""What are you looking
for the Devil for, when you ought to be looking for the Lord?""

AFL JoyceM Welcome to the Apple II Music & Sound chat - our discussion will
           be on NoiseTracker - the new FTA music program for the GS.  AFA
           Gene will be our host this evening...Gene, the floor is yours :)

AFA Gene   Hi all... well first I'd like to point out, if y'all aren't aware
           yet, that a spanking new version of NoiseTracker has recently
           been released (9 days ago) and is now available in our New Files
           library. It is version 0.5. I haven't played around with it much
           yet, but it's supposed to fix a lot of the little bugs in 0.3
           (the first version we had online).  NoiseTracker also includes
           the ability to directly import ""modules,"" a term used for a
           certain type of Amiga song file which has become popular among PC
           users using the SoundBlaster sound card.

           Now, via NT, these ""MOD"" files are accessible by the GS. We
           expect to see a lot of activity on this end as far as ports from
           the PC and Amiga go. Note that you should be able to go straight
           to the PC music forum and download any recently uploaded MOD
           songfiles (there was a bug in the first wide release of the PCAO
           software, however, so a bunch of files with dates between around
           March 1991 and September 1991 may not download properly. Note that
           to use these PC MOD files, you'll have to rename the downloaded
           file ""MOD.xxxxxx"" if you want it to show up automatically in NT's
           ""open"" dialog box. (On the PC, all MOD files are named
           ""xxxxxxxx.MOD"" instead.)   Also, if the files are packed with ZIP
           compression, you'll need a program from the Communications Forum
           called AGATE -- it's a terminal program that includes the ability
           to unpack ZIP files.

           Now, I guess the best thing to do would be to talk about our
           favorite songfiles... there have been a few complaints, in fact,
           that people were not being ""descriptive"" enough in their file
           descriptions for uploads in describing the songs.

AFC Eddie  ?

AFA Gene   GA ed

AFC Eddie  Once a MOD file is unpacked with Agate, is a file type change
           needed?

AFA Gene   Nope, since all that NT looks for is the ""MOD."" being the first
           four characters in the filename.

AFC Eddie  OK, Thanks!

Deanna7332 Question...

JonL7      Can you list some of the features of Noisetracker?

AFA Gene   (you don't even need that ""MOD."" if you want to type the name in
           directly.)

Deanna7332 Did any of these mod files have anything to do with FTA's ""Module
           A""

AFA Gene   Sure Jon, right after we answer Deanna's question. Deanna, you
           mean ""Modulae?""

Deanna7332 Yes, that's it.

AFA Gene   Modulae was a demo written by FTA last year. (i'll get to you in a
           sec Doors).  It used SoundSmith v0.95 for all it's music. There
           is no connection between MOD files and Modulae by FTA.

Deanna7332 Throughout the demo it said ""Loading modules""

AFA Gene   Those ""modules"" are not the same as Amiga soundfile ""modules"" --
           you see, what Modulae really was was a ""stringing together"" of a
           bunch of neat little tiny demos that FTA had written. So they
           called each little demo a ""module"" and thus the entire demo as a
           whole, ""Modulae"" (fancy plural of module?)

Deanna7332 Ok I understand.  Thank you. :)

AFL JoyceM Latin, Gene :)

AFA Gene   The term ""MODule"" from the Amiga comes from the idea that all the
           stuff needed to play the songfile (all the instruments + the
           sequence file) are included into one file, the ""module.""

TheDoors1  Gene, I have tried to d/l some recent uploaded MODs in the PC
           music area and still the problem exists.

AFA Gene   As I understand it, the problem was fixed VERY recently (correct
           me on this Joyce) and files uploaded as recently as early
           November still might not work depending on the version of the
           PCAO software that the uploader used.

AFL JoyceM Actually, Gene...I was under the impression that it had been, but
           if Doors is still having a problem, then it must not be fixed.

AFA Gene   What date was the file you tried to d/l, Door?

TheDoors1  umm 11/17, around there

AFA Gene   hmmm.... well i can tell you one thing... if it didn't work, don't
           waste your time again later... the problem is in the Apple
           software's method of d/lling files, and there are no plans to
           upgrade the Apple AO software.

AFL JoyceM I will endeavor to get an answer to that PC downloading
           problem/question :)

ThomasK63  i have a quick question... what can you use to unpack amiga mod
           files? On the PC side, that is.

TheDoors1  Agate Thomas

ELECTMUSIC Doors... what happens on after downloading..

Deanna7332 If it's LZHed you can't unless you have an IBM or
           PC/Transporter.

AFA Gene   If GS-ShrinkIt doesn't have that ability, i don't think there
           exists any such utility on the GS.

TheDoors1  What do you mean Elect?

ELECTMUSIC After you download the file... where do you encounter a problem?

TheDoors1  ok, you know when you download the file and at some point in the
           download the file starts to appear on your screen.  That's when I
           cancel it.

ThomasK63  I am sure soething good can be made w/out resorting to Amiga
           files

AFC Eddie  Yes, Doors, I believe the problem is with the PC software it was
           UL'd with.

TheDoors1  yeah Eddie.

GNO Tim    Amiga MOD files are typically compressed using LHarc.  I've
           uncompressed several on my Unix machine at school.

ThomasK63  good time for someone to make a lharc unpacker...

AFC DYAJim someone might be ;)

GNO Tim    Several people are already

AFC Eddie  Can't wait, Jim!

AFA Gene   Jon, did you have a question?

JonL7      The features of Noisetracker :)

AFA Gene   Oh yes... okay, here goes, in a nutshell, from most important to
           least:


AFA Gene   *  ability to import MOD files

           *  ability to import Soundsmith files

           *  ProDOS 8 based

           *  virtually no editing abilities (not a feature but important to
           know)

AFC DYAJim :)

AFA Gene   *  forgot: and the most important feature of all, the ability to
           hold instrument files in regular system RAM instead of DOC RAM,
           allowing for instruments far beyond the regular 64K limit found
           in ALL other GS music programs.

ThomasK63  I'll buy that!

TheDoors1  I have another question...when you're ready.

AFA Gene   GA Doors

TheDoors1  ok..is it true that NoiseTracker will take in soundsmith files and
           play them more clearly

AFA Gene   Well, as far as ""what you hear,"" yes there is a definite
           difference with some instruments. It does NOT play the sounds
           more ""clearly,"" but it just plays them in a different way. What
           many people seem to like about this ""different way"" is that
           sustained instruments (i.e. instruments designed to be played
           in a loop to simulate a long held note) seem to work better (or
           perhaps simply the way they were originally intended to work).

TheDoors1  I see

Deanna7332 Which takes up more space - MOD or NT  w/soundfile ?

AFA Gene   Deanna, it depends a few things, such as how big the sequence is,
           how many instruments you have, etc. Once you have a lot of
           assorted files, it'll probably average out to be about the same
           give or take a hundred blocks on your HD. So it basically depends
           on whether you prefer to have your instruments separate or not.

Deanna7332 Does playing quality differ with either one ?

AFA Gene   Nope. It's exactly the same either way. Loading time is the same
           too.

AFC Eddie  Can NT save songs as MOD files?

AFA Gene   Nope. It has options for Open and Close module, but these are
           still inactive.

AFA Gene   If there are no more questions, I'd like to talk about which NT
           files out there are the ""hottest,"" since this info could be
           useful to many users who are interested in downloading NT/MOD
           files.

           My personal favorite is ""Lambada,"" which is supplied by FTA with
           the program but is available separately on America
           Online.Everything about this file is really impressive except
           perhaps the sound quality of the horn-ish melody instrument.

           What about y'all, what are your favorite NT files?

AFL JoyceM Gene, there is a classical song for NT, but can't remember the
           name, but it is good.

AFC Eddie  I like Dragnet!

ELECTMUSIC So do I Ed

TheDoors1  I like Seven something

Deanna7332 My most favorite of all mod files is Pleasure Principle

AFC Eddie  <--appreciate's Greg's taste!

AFL JoyceM :)

AFA Gene   Deanna, i assume you got that from a local board?

Deanna7332 I got it from the PC forum here.

TheDoors1  I saw it there also

Deanna7332 I think under ""Pleasure""

AFA Gene   Would you be able to upload it here? If it's really that good, we
           ought to have it available directly in our oun NT lib here (BTW
           folks, we will be releasing a new NoiseTracker software library
           soon!)

AFC Eddie  What a Forum!!!

Deanna7332 That sounds great!

AFL JoyceM Gene, do you think it will be possible for synthLAB files to be
           converted to MOD files?

AFL JoyceM MOD files?

AFA Gene   I doubt it, Joyce. The formats are so diametrically opposed in
           their entire basis of their file formats that it wouldn't be
           worth the time for a programmer to develop such a convertor.

Deanna7332 Isn't it possible to move the mod file from the PC forum to our
           music library?

AFA Gene   But..... it might be worth the time for a MIDI File Format to MOD
           convertor, since these two formats are more widely accepted.

Nuzz       they have nothing better to do Gene

ELECTMUSIC Gene.. some interesting similarities with DTune and NTracker

AFA Gene   They lose the file, tho, Deanna. :)

AFL JoyceM In what way, Greg?

ELECTMUSIC Both Prodos 8

Deanna7332 Shhh they won't know a thing :)

ELECTMUSIC I also believe Bill uses a shuttling of sound data between Doc
           Ram and Ram.

AFC Eddie  Interesting, Greg.

ELECTMUSIC Thats how he gets some of the excellent instrument quality

AFC Eddie  But Diversitune has that one distinction:  MIDI input.

AFL JoyceM Deanna, we would greatly appreciate it if you would upload that
           'Pleasure' song to our library :)

ELECTMUSIC Agreed Ed.. one of the factors FTA doesn't like to incorporate
           into their programs.

Deanna7332 I'll u/l it tonight if possible.

AFL JoyceM Thanks :)

AFC Eddie  Thanks, Deanna!

AFL JoyceM I will send Bill B a copy of NoiseTracker + some MOD files...to
           see what comments we get from him (will send when I get back).

AFC DYAJim What ever happened to that diversitune upgrade that was talked
           about ?

ELECTMUSIC That would be interesting Joyce

AFC Eddie  Bill apparently still working on it, Jim.

ELECTMUSIC I am sure he would appreciate the Prodos 8

AFC DYAJim good..

AFL JoyceM Jim...RSN....he was hoping by Christmas (this year), but he is
           soooo busy with his job, who knows?

AFC DYAJim Oh yeah, I noticed the speed calcuation in NT .5 is inaccurate
           :)

AFC DYAJim I recall he has set a lot of Christmas projected dates :)

ELECTMUSIC He was one of the first ""Free Tools"" experts in breaking all the
           rules for economic sake.

AFC DYAJim like for the vaporware DT inst editor like 2 years ago.

Deanna7332 Are there any Christmas Mod or NT songs?

AFC Eddie  Oh yeah, Diversi-Editor!

AFL JoyceM I know, Jim - but that I know he has been working on.

AFC DYAJim he projected Christmas for it, and it never came :)

AFA Gene   Not yet in AMS, but hopefully the Holiday Contest will change all
           that. :)

AFC DYAJim I look foreward to any upgrades..

AFL JoyceM Not that I am aware of Deanna - you have some?  hint, hint

Deanna7332 Nope sorry.  I was hoping there were some that could be u/led
           here

AFC DYAJim I'll be breaking out the xmas tune book rsn.. I should be able to
           midi a few :) (which rules out nt)

AFL JoyceM Question...

AFC Eddie  It would be more appropriate to have a converter from Appleworks
           spreadsheet to MOD than from MIDI!

AFL JoyceM If I got ahold of an Amiga song (MOD) disk...how would I convert
           them for here?

AFA Gene   You mean an Amiga-formatted disk?

AFL JoyceM Yes

AFC DYAJim Ack.. methinks you need an amiga and a null modem cable or a
           modem.

AFA Gene   Methinks Jim is right

AFC DYAJim LOL!!  Design your music in the spreadsheet then import to NT :)
           IT might actually have better editing?!! :)

AFC Eddie  Right!

AFL JoyceM Me thinks he is right.  If I had them upload to me, would that
           work?

AFA Gene   Yep; should work like a charm.

AFC DYAJim Yah.. as long as they're coming from an amiga

AFL JoyceM Great....I will work on that when I get back  (making note now).

AFL JoyceM Gene, will you get some of those files (NT) sent to that area
           tonight?  If so, I will leave the needed message :)

AFA Gene   That's all I have planned for tonight's chat, Joyce. Yep, I'll
           move some files right now.

AFL JoyceM Thanks...

AFL JoyceM Then we should have our NoiseTracker Library by end of the week in
           AMS :)

ELECTMUSIC Gene... quick question:  Are you launching NTracker from a 3.5
           disk?

AFL JoyceM Okay, guys...I will see you all the week of December 11th (may the
           4th) as I am off on vacation.

AFA Gene   Yep greg

AFC JohnC  Where are you going?

ELECTMUSIC Do you encounter out of memory problems

AFL JoyceM Night all...and Gene, thanks for an excellent chat and great
           explanations of NoiseTracker.

Nuzz       Joyce, I have good news for FutureSound owners. SoundConvert will
           support it in the first release

AFC Eddie  Great, Mike!

AFA Gene   Greg, i always keep my RAMdisk at 0 when using noisetracker. Not
           only are

AFC JohnC  Mike...SoundConvert...released?

AFL JoyceM Great, Mike.  When can we get SoundConvert, Mike? and FutureSound
           :)

AFA Gene   there a couple of bugs with memory management, but if you're
           loading in a MOD file that's really big, NT will eat your RAMdisk.

AFC Eddie  Sounds good.

Nuzz       The manual is being ""layout"". Release date should be about 1st
           week of Dec

ELECTMUSIC Tnxs Gene

AFC JohnC  YES.......WTG Nuzz!!!!!!!!

Deanna7332 Yes, why is there on some MOD files a stop somewhere in the middle
           ?

Deanna7332 That's really frustrating!

AFL JoyceM Mike, leave me E-Mail on when and how I can send your the $$ to
           get it.

AFL JoyceM Again...night all

Nuzz       gee John, I had to do something to explain the delay :)

ELECTMUSIC Thanks Gene for a GREAT chat!

AFC Eddie  Yes, Gene!  Great!

AFA Gene   Thanks Greg, 'night!

AFA Gene   thanx, see y'all later :)

Copyright 1987 Bob Szekely.

    John Michael Osbourne, (known as ""Ozzy"" to his fans), has in his long 
career as vocalist for Black Sabbath had his work with the group misconstrued 
as advocating Satanism.  In a 1983 radio special featuring Ozzy, the 
interviewer expressed precisely this point; ""...Ozzy has always been shrouded 
in the darkest of Satanic imagery.  Yet if you really listen to his music, 
you'll find that what he is saying differs greatly from his image....""(1)  Even 
the group's image has often been described as ""occult and diabolic"".(2)

    The important point to remember here is to differentiate between appearance 
and reality.  Although the name ""Black Sabbath"" conjures up images of witches 
and sorcerers paying homage to Satan for the powers bestowed upon them, this 
does not make it safe to assume that the group that went by this name 
necessarily drew the inspiration from the occult.(3)  The closest they ever 
came to it was a gothic horror film featuring Boris Karloff as narrator; they 
adopted their name directly from the name of this film.(4)  Black Sabbath was 
involved in the black arts as much as Karloff practiced casting spells off-
screen.  Tony Iommi, the group's guitarist, summed it up best when he described 
the group as having basically ""...the same appeal as a horror movie.  It's all 
an act.""(5)










    Just as their film counterpart did, Ozzy and Sabbath found the occult 
mythos to be an effective vehicle for powerful social commentary; particularly 
when put in the context of heavy-metal rock and roll.  Ozzy himself noted that 
there are ""...people who pick up my [album] cover[s] and go...'This guy's got 
to be singing about Devil, doom, death and destruction.'  Which is not the 
case....""(6)

    The late Lester Bangs likened the group to Bob Dylan and William Burroughs, 
describing them all as ""...moralists...trying to deal with a serious present 
situation in an honest way....""(7)  Ozzy and Black Sabbath merely bring to 
light the many evils of our world in their work, to try and make us realize 
that we are all victim to their influence.  They hope to make us recognize 
these evils so that we may take up arms against them; a point Ozzy emphatically 
stresses:  ""...one thing everybody has got to understand about Black Sabbath's 
lyrics.  They're not downer lyrics, they're just telling everybody where it's 
at...""(8)  He also cites the group's most controversial tune, ""Black Sabbath"", 
as a response to the ignorant hippie culture still force when the tune was 
written in 1970:  ""The hippies said: 'The world is beautiful man.' (sic)  You 
only had to look around you to see how crappy it was.  It was ridiculous 
listening to that stuff, let alone playing it, so we just wrote about the world 
the way it really was and how it affected us - and we felt better in ourselves 
because we were really being honest....""(9)

    I   1   HAVE YOU EVER THOUGH ABOUT YOUR SOUL-
        2   CAN IT BE SAVED?
        3   OR PERHAPS YOU THINK THAT WHEN YOU ARE DEAD
        4   YOU JUST STAY IN YOUR GRAVE.
        5   IS GOD JUST A THOUGHT WITHIN YOUR HEAD OR IS
        6   HE A PART OF YOU?
        7   IS CHRIST JUST A NAME THAT YOU READ IN A BOOK
        8   WHEN YOU WERE AT SCHOOL?

    II  9   WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT DEATH DO YOU LOSE
        10  YOUR BREATH OR DO YOU KEEP YOUR COOL?
        11  WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE THE POPE ON THE END
        12  OF A ROPE - DO YOU THINK HE'S A FOOL?
        13  WELL I'VE SEEN THE TRUTH - YES I'VE SEEN 
        14  THE LIGHT AND I'VE CHANGED MY WAYS.
        15  AND I'LL BE PREPARED WHEN YOU'RE LONELY 
        16  AND SCARED AT THE END OF OUR DAYS.

    III 17  COULD IT BE YOU'RE AFRAID OF WHAT YOU'R
        18  FRIENDS MIGHT SAY 
        19  IF THEY NEW YOU BELIEVED IN GOD ABOVE
        20  THEY SHOULD REALISE BEFORE THE CRITICISE
        21  THAT GOD IS THE ONLY WAY TO LOVE.

    IV  23  IS YOUR MIND SO SMALL THAT YOU HAVE TO FALL
        24 IN WITH THE PACK WHEREVER THEY RUN
        25  WILL YOU STILL SNEER WHEN DEATH IS NEAR
        26  AND SAY THEY MAY AS WELL WORSHIP THE SUN.

    V   27  I THINK IT WAS TRUE IT WAS PEOPLE LIKE YOU
        28  THAT CRUCIFIED CHRIST
        29  I THINK IT IS SAD THE OPINION YOU HADE WAS THE
        30  ONLY ONE VOICED.
        31  WILL YOU BE SO SURE WHEN YOUR DAY IS NEAR
        32  SAY YOU DON'T BELIEVE?
        33  YOU HAD THE CHANCE BUT YOU TURNED IT DOWN
        34  NOW YOU CAN'T RETRIEVE.










    VI  35  PERHAPS YOU'LL THINK BEFORE YOU SAY THAT
        36  GOD IS DEAD AND GONE
        37  OPEN YOUR EYES, JUST REALIZE THAT HE IS THE
        38  ONE.
        39  THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN SAVE YOU KNOW FROM
        40  ALL THIS SIN AND HATE.
        41  OR WILL YOU STILL JEER AT ALL YOU HEAR?
        42  YES!-I THINK IT'S TOO LATE.

    In this piece, the group asserts a belief in an afterlife and spiritual 
redemption.  As grisly as the image of a hanged pontiff is, its shock value is 
a necessary part of the message:  They reject religious dogma, stating that a 
belief in God, in one's own heart, is the only guiding light to help one inn 
his life (lines 11/12, 39/40).  Furthermore, the reject religious hypocrisy 
(lines 5/6, 7/8) and peer pressure (verses III, IV) as excuses for not 
accepting God.  To clarify further:  following the crowd does not justify 
shrugging responsibility for one's own actions.

    After re-reading, it becomes obvious that this song is an ascerbic critique 
of atheism; (line 35/36) I refer here again to verses three and four.  In these 
two verses, the picture painted in one of Godless conformity and how it's 
viewed as being as foolish as Paganism.  These lyrics set an example for the 
listener by relating personal experience (lines 13-16).  However, for those who 
cannot accept this the group has no recourse but to condemn them, although 
rather ironically; they hope that their rhetorical loss of faith in the 
listener will open his eyes (line 42).










                           B L A C K   S A B B A T H 



            WHAT IS THIS, THAT STANDS BEFORE ME?
            FIGURE IN BLACK, WHICH POINTS AT ME
            TURN ROUND QUICK AND START TO RUN
            FIND OUT I'M THE CHOSEN ONE.  OH, NO!
            
            BIG BLACK SHAPE WITH EYES OF FIRE
            TELLING PEOPLE THEIR DESIRE
            SATAN'S SITTING THERE, HE'S SMILING
            WATCHES THOSE FLAMES GET HIGHER AND HIGHER
            OH, NO, NO, -- PLEASE GOD HELP ME!
            
                IS THIS THE END MY FRIEND?
                SATAN'S COMING 'ROUND THE BEND
                PEOPLE RUNNING 'CAUSE THEY'RE SCARED
                THE PEOPLE BETTER GO AND BEWARE
                NO, NO!  PLEASE--NO!!
                
                
    The all time controversy winner!  Is this not irrefutably  THE song about 
Black Magic in rock?  It's all so obvious, suffuse with evil imagery; Satan, 
walls of flame, figure in black, and damnation at the end.  Yes, I see the 
images too; it definitely concerns Black Magic.  Then again, Shakespeare's 
Macbeth employed scenes of witches involved in conjurations; does that mean 
that Shakespeare was a warlock?  Poe used to write sardonic tragedies about 
twisted murderers and the bizarre nature of acts, did that make him an evil, 
leering, demented killer?  Did either of them advocated what they wrote about?  
One has to remember that writing about something is not necessarily the same as 
emulating it.  Tony Iommi spoke out quite strongly about this:  ""People are 
bringing us down saying that we are a Black Magic group.  I think they must be










getting mixed up with Black Widow.  We don't do any sacrifices on stage, and 
we're not on a black magic kick.  We wanted to do heavy numbers and the guitar 
riffs we worked out were more suited to evil things than love.  We play songs 
about black magic, but they are more likely to be against than for it.""(12)  

    By now, you're probably asking yourself who Black Widow is, right?  Then 
it's time for a little history:

        Sabbath, before they were known as Sabbath, had the same line-up but 
two earlier names.  The first one was Polka Tulk, which seemed sure to doom 
them to obscurity.(13)  The soon realized this and changed the group's name to 
Earth.  Now, Earth was a blues band at the end of the English blues boom.  As 
if that wasn't bad enough, they soon discovered that not only was there another 
group named Earth, but they had also released a single.  To avoid confusion, 
they changed their name again.(14)  But what made them decide on that name?  
Just ask Ozzy:  ""I just liked the name Black Sabbath because of the succession 
of vowel sounds.(15)  If that sounds ludicrous just consider this:  Sabbath was 
""...the first of the really committed, loud and heavy bands...""(16)  They 
needed a name to match the gut-wrenching power they were developing.  Tony knew 
that he wanted Sabbath to be noticed above all the rest of the British blues 
bands:  ""We wanted something of our own that we'd like and people would like.  
And we wanted something loud!""










    Tony didn't hate the blues.  He'd cut his teeth as a guitarist on the likes 
of The Shadows, Buddy Holly and Django Rheinhardt, developing his own style 
from there.  But he realized the group had no future in the blues:

        'We couldn't keep playing 12-bars forever.  We just got fed up with 
Earth music.  It was jazz, blues stuff.  It was good for practice but nothing 
else.'

    In the late 'Sixties, blues groups were a dime a dozen in Birmingham and 
interest was waning in the blues boom due to the glut of groups.  One man, by 
the name of Jim Simpson, had heard Earth around the Birmingham club circuit and 
understood what they were trying to do.  He decided to take them under his 
wing.  With the aid of his massive record collection, Jim expanded the group's 
horizons in the areas of jazz and blues.  He introduced them to artists like 
Wes Montgomery, Count Basie and Jimmy Rushing.  It was from Rushing in 
particular that they derived the repetitive riff style so readily noticeable in 
their later incarnation as Black Sabbath.

    The Count Basie influence is evidenced in the song ""Wicked World"" from the 
first album; Sabbath drummer Bill Ward uses a ""'sighing hi-hat'...in the manner 
of Basie's drummer Jo Jones.""










    The influence is subtle, almost subliminal.  Yet it is one which was not 
thought capable of hard, 'heavy' rock bands in the late 'Sixties.  Although Led 
Zeppelin and Jimi Hendrix also had their work steeped in blues and jazz 
derivations (Hendrix' ""Third Stone From the Sun"" and Zeppelin's version of 
Willie Dixon's ""I Can't Quit You Baby"" from their first album), neither was 
able to match the intense energy of Black Sabbath.  Iommi has always had a 
preference for music with an original, distinct style of its' own; as an 
example, he mentions guitarists Joe Pass and Alvin Lee as two of his strongest 
songwriting influences.

    It would also be necessary that Sabbath develop a unique, distinctive style 
and image of their own.  Though they had changed their name from Earth to Black 
Sabbath to avoid confusion with the other Earth; at the same time another group 
emerged by the name of Black Widow ""...who WERE profoundly influenced by the 
occult, had a male witch as a patron, and wrote pieces like ""Come to The 
Sabbat.""  Unfortunately, Sabbath was constantly reaping the benefits of Widow's 
publicity.

    Sabbath was a group that never minced words.  If they saw something as 
destructive, they would be sure to rub the listener's face it it.  They did not 
want their point to be missed.

    With their straightforward, sometimes brutal way of looking at things, they 
try to shock the listener's conscience back into awareness.  The imagery of 
""Hand of Doom"", from the Paranoid album, is candid and condemning; it is a 
strong statement against drug addiction and rightly so...

            PRICE OF LIFE YOU CRY
            NOW YOU'RE GONNA DIE
            
            
    Many people felt the group's overall direction was pessimistic and had a 
negative effect on its listener's due to that.  ""Ozzy insisted that if people 
thought he was having a bad effect on the minds of young kids, they should go 
and watch the TV news where real murder and mayhem were a way of life, and 
shown night after night."" (18)

    Sabbath was never negative in their message; they were simply truthful 
about waht they saw as wrong in the world.  If you ""Strip away the horror 
stories, the imagery and the hysteria, (and) turn down the amps a notch...you 
have a well-rehearsed, solid blues and rock band, powered by a dedication to 
well defined objectives.""  On the top of the list of those objectives was 
truth; Sabbath never feared facing that truth squarely, regardless of what many 
people thought of them.

Long, long, time ago,
I can still remember,
When the local calls were ""free"".
And I knew if I paid my bill,
And never wished them any ill,
That the phone company would let me be...

But Uncle Sam said he knew better,
Split 'em up, for all and ever!
We'll foster competition:
It's good capital-ism!

I can't remember if I cried,
When my phone bill first tripled in size.
But something touched me deep inside,
The day... Bell System... died.

And we were singing...

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

Is your office Step by Step,
Or have you gotten some Crossbar yet?
Everybody used to ask...
Oh, is TSPS coming soon?
IDDD will be a boon!
And, I hope to get a Touch-Tone phone, real soon...

The color phones are really neat,
And direct dialing can't be beat!
My area code is ""low"":
The prestige way to go!

Oh, they just raised phone booths to a dime!
Well, I suppose it's about time.
I remember how the payphones chimed,
The day... Bell System... died.

And we were singing...

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

Back then we were all at one rate,
Phone installs didn't cause debate,
About who'd put which wire where...
Installers came right out to you,
No ""phone stores"" with their ballyhoo,
And 411 was free, seemed very fair!

But FCC wanted it seems,
To let others skim long-distance creams,
No matter 'bout the locals,
They're mostly all just yokels!

And so one day it came to pass,
That the great Bell System did collapse,
In rubble now, we all do mass,
The day... Bell System... died.

So bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

I drove on out to Murray Hill,
To see Bell Labs, some time to kill,
But the sign there said the Labs were gone.
I went back to my old CO,
Where I'd had my phone lines, years ago,
But it was empty, dark, and ever so forlorn...

No relays pulsed,
No data crooned,
No MF tones did play their tunes,
There wasn't a word spoken,
All carrier paths were broken...

And so that's how it all occurred,
Microwave horns just nests for birds,
Everything became so absurd,
The day... Bell System... died.

So bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

We were singing:

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?

With bold Gilgamesh the Brave!      but that's good enough for me!

We will all see Aphrodite               We will all sing Hare Krishna
Though she's pretty wild and flighty    We will all sing Hare Krishna
She will meet us in her nightie         It's not mentioned in the Mishna
And she's good enough for me!           But it's good enough for me!

It was good enough for Loki         We will all go to Nirvana

Here's to those who copy Conan    There will be a lot of lovin

They're just Followers of Onan    Quit yer pushin and yer shovin
and that's good enough for me!    So there's room enough for me!

We will have a mighty Party           It was good enough for Sappho
In the honor of Astarte               With her lady on her lap-o
Grab your chiton - don't be tardy     She put Lesbos on the map-o
'Cause she's good enough for me!      With her pagan poetry!

Shall we sing a verse for Venus,    Well the Christians all are humming
Of the Gods she is the meanest,     Cause they say their God is coming,
Cause she bit me on my...elbow      Our God came three times this evening
And it's good enough for me.        And that's good enough for me.

                                             (Atenveldt Verses)

   Now here's a story, a little bit gory,
   A little bit happy, a little bit sad.
   About a drink called Imperium Compound
   And how the SCA's been had!                       

   Chorus: Oh we think, we think, we think,
           The King is a fink, a fink, a fink,
           A figure of respectability
           Rules the Kingdom thru Imperium Compound
           The results are plain to see!

   Mongol Hordemen, those free-living swordsmen
   Subverting the Kingdoms from underneath!
   Have no use for Imperium Compound
   Except perhaps to brush their teeth!

   AltChorus: Oh we fink, we fink, we fink,
              The Khan and the Kink, the Kink, the Kink,
              And the Board, their Great Senilities!
              The Western Irgun, drinks Imperium Compound
              And we're BACK, with results you'll see!    

   Lady Laurel, with Authority Royal,
   Passes and rejects our heraldry
   She needs a swig of Imperium Compound
   Then perhaps she'd deign to talk to me!            

   Lady Trude thought it her duty
   To turn a social wrong into a Right
   Proved her point with Imperium Compound
   And showed that Cheshire Cats can fight!  //and scratch//

   The Board of Directors styled themselves The Electors
   And another con they tried to swing
   Now the BoD drinks Imperium Compound
   So we no longer need a King!                        

   AltChorus: Oh the Bod, the BoD, the BoD,
              It thinks it is God, is God, is God,
              The figure of Supreme Authority!
              And if we O.D.'d on Imperium Compund
              there'd be no need for Royalty!          

   Oh, MEDIEVAL Net, we thought it was all wet
   With witty remarks, and other kinds of sass
   We'll feed our computers on Imperium Compound
   And BYTE the BoD right on its' righteous ass!         

   Good old Duncan was often drunken
   Chasing all the ladies fair
   He bathed himself in Imperium Compound
   Now he has a little savoir faire!

              And it works the best when it is underground!

   And went off to conquer Engel-land!                    

   Then King Richard, a bit of a bitch, heard
   A King's Crown could be done.
   Drank a little Imperium Compound
   And became the Aten King, first one!                    

   Duchess Malinda, who doesn't do windas,
   But she does a lot of Duchess Things,
   But give her a LOT of Imperium Compound,
   And she sings and sings and sings and sings and sings!   

   Duke Sir Brion, with his pretty white suit on,
   Is a model of goodness and purity
   Never touches Imperium Compound
(spoken:) And I'll sell ya seashore property in Yuma, too!  

   Optional last verse:

   Many tales abound of Imperium Compound
   And its' strange effects on Royalty,
   But after an hour, this song has no power,
   And by now, it's boring ME!                            

   AltChorus: Oh it's too long, too long, too long
              To sing the whole song, the song, the song
              Longer than a Royal Court, it is!
              But sing it serial, this ditty Imperial
              And you'll be a bardic whiz!

        Last night I had the strangest dream in this bleak century
        I dreamed that people the world around believed in Chivalry

        I dreamed I saw a Kingly Crown enshrined in laurel leaves
        with Grace and Joy and Purity attendant at his feet

        I dreamed I saw the perfect Knight receive his accolade
        and minstrels sang and children laughed in some soft forest glade

        I dreamed I saw the finest thing that ever man could make
        grow great and strong and undefiled: Pray God I never wake!

        Last night I had the strangest dream in this bleak century
        I dreamed that people the world around believed in Chivalry

               (to the tune of ""Good King Wenceslaus"")

                Locksley Monsters never yield
                on the field of battle
                strike the helm and bash the shield
                make their eyeteeth rattle
                Bodies on the ground will lie
                bones will burst in sunder
                search for Locksleys' enemies:
                You'll find them six feet under!

                              SONG OF IVANOF

            There is a man who we know well that does the best he can
            but he's displayed in armour made of reticulated garbage cans!

            He looks so fine and fair and strong, oh how he plays the man
            and how it's prized, those galvanized, reticulated garbage cans

            The noblest Roman of them all, a good Praetorian
            a combatant who wears no pants, judst reticulated garbage cans!

            Like old Horatius at the Bridge, like the Legions of Valerian
            (O dearie me: those LOVELY knees!)
            and those reticulated garbage cans!

                         C. McCray Bethancourt

         (sung to the tune (obviously) of the 12 Days of Christmas)


1.           The first time I sent my device, The Heralds said to me

            ""It violates the Rule of Three""

2.           The next time I tried it, the Heralds said to me

            ""We changed the forms, and it violates the Rule of
             Three"".

3.           The third time I tried, and the Heralds said to me, 

            ""We upped the fees, we changed the forms, and it
             violates the Rule of Three"".

4.           Another time I tried and the Heralds said to me,
 
            ""We haven't got it, we upped the fees, we changed the 
             forms, and it violates the Rule of Three"".

5.           The fifth time I tried it, the Heralds said to me,  

            ""In a decision rendered by the College of Arms on
             August 1st, A.S. V it was decided that this style of
             heraldic design was not appropriate to the aims and 
             intentions of the Corporate Body. Holy! Holy! Holy! ""

 note: verse 5 is delivered in an extremely fast, mono-
       tone, similiar to a Gregorian Chant.

           "" ....we haven't got it, we upped the fees, we changed the forms,
             and it violates the Rule of Three.""

6.           I tried it a sixth time, and the Heralds said to me,

            ""We changed the rules, &c""

7.           A seventh time I tried and, the Heralds said to me,

            ""It's against the Rule of Tincture, we changed the
             rules, &c""

8.           I tried it once again and the heralds said to me,

            ""It's not a Period design, It's against the Rule of Tincture, We
             changed the rules, &c""

                                * more *



    Heralds Said To Me (cont.)

9.           I sent it in once more, and the Heralds said to me,

            ""We changed the rules again, It's not a Period design,
             it's against the Rule of Tincture, we changed the
             rules, &c""

10. (sung in cold anger)
             The LAST time I sent my device, the Heralds said to me

    (sung in a state of SMUG)
             ""Someone else has got it, &c""




              (nb: every single one of these reasons has been used by the
              CoA, at one point or another, to reject perfectly good
              heraldry, along with some even MORE stupid.  If the shoe 
              fits....................!!!!!!!!)

                        Tune: Waltzing Matilda
 
           or: Who was that Vermin I saw you with last, Knight?
   or: There may be Lice on all you Knice, but there ain't no Lice on me

           Once there was a Barony howling in the wilderness
           nestled in the Valley where the River doesn't flow
           and the folks were driven buggy by the insects in the Revel Hall
           Authenticity is wonderful, but this doesn't go!

                   Bugs on the Baroness, bugs on the Baroness!
                   That was the cry that you heard all the day
                   and the scratching can be heard from Ysgithr to Ered Sul
                   why did we come here? Let's go away!

           See them all a scratching, nestled in their armour tight
           the fleas have a melee team that's challenging the field!
           call Truly Nolen! Someone's gotta help us out!
           the crabs are nesting in our helms but we'll never yield!

                   (chorus)

           Dawn comes a-breaking, the bugs have won the Coronet...
           flea-infested Conan-clones in piles upon the lawn
           where is the Barony? The bugs have eaten everyone...
           termites got the stick-jocks, and all their sticks are gone!

                   (chorus)

                          ATENVELDT
                          tune: The West's Awake

                  For all the Lands where I have dwelt
                  Oh Atenveldt, Oh Atenveldt
                  till rivers burn and mountains melt
                  lest I forget my Atenveldt
                  From deserts stark to snow-capped peaks
                  from silent lakes and laughing creeks
                  sing: Oh let man find his heart's ease
                  on rocky plains
                  in desert breeze

                  For oft I thought of mighty men
                  who carved a Land with sword and pen
                  and lit a candle, burning bright,
                  that pierced the darkness; stirred the night!
                  tho some are gone their deeds remain
                  this sunny Crown without a stain
                  sing: Oh, their deeds were not in vain!
                  in sunlit days
                  and falling rain.....

                  So raise your banners, blazoned bright
                  Advance the Dream and Shine the Light!
                  in battle's crash and Revel's song
                  raise high the Flag and wave it long!
                  For all the Lands wherein I've dwelt
                  I love you best, my Atenveldt!
                  Sing: Oh the Joy that I have felt!
                  My Atenveldt
                  My Atenveldt

      What the use of wearing panties
      whalebone corsets of your Auntie's
      boxer shorts and other scanties
      best of all is nude
      there's such fun in going bra-less
      now that it's no longer lawless
      'specially if your figure's flawless
      best of all is nude
      nude is what you're born in
      shirts are never torn in
      underwear and lacy flimsies, garter belts and other whimsies
      yards of itchy cloth to put your form in
      ducks all do it, maidens rue it
      even ancient Picts in Britain blue it
      going naked's how to do it
      best of all is nude!

      If your garters aren't elastic
      tie them up in knots fantastic
      (panty hose is something drastic!)
      best of all is nude!
      If you're tired of wearing clotheses
      shed your garment 'mongst the roses
      never mind the old bluenoses
      best of all is nude!
      Nude is best for ducking!
      Worst for horses bucking!
      Moonlit nights will see such sights
          that are very best for fooling round
                              .....and elbows!
      Nudity is grand to see
       a well-known antidote to virginity
      take your clothes off and you'll see:
      best of all is nude!

                   once I talked to a great Grey Man
                   spun three times and said with a sigh
                   hadn't been for the Runes had his other eye!

                   prettiest thing I've ever seen
                   she went down underneath the hill
                   and came back out of her own free will

                   Brian Boru, on Irish ground
                   walked three times the Island round
                   Norsemen came lookin for a fight

                   a Druid and he got in to the Feast!

                   Harold Haardrada's face was red!

                   got six feet of English ground

                   the Legion with it's Eagles bright
                   marched into the Pictish night
                   met them there upon the sand
                   gave em up to the Wicker Man!

                   eight-legged steed and hound of Hel
                   the one-eyed Man, he loves ya well

                   are you then feared of the dark?

                   The Circle forms, the Circle flows
                   the Circle goes where no man knows
                   Hail to the Lady, one in three:
                   Present is Past and Past is Me!

                   Rhiannon's Birds are still in flight

                        tune: They Call the Wind Maria

        Away out here they have a name for even the Ump that's Wuggly
        But the last word in Awfulness, M'Lady, you're The Ugly!

                M'Lady, M'Lady, they call the pigs M'Lady!

        Before I knew M'Lady's name and heard her constant whinin'
        I thought all girls were beautiful and the sun was always shinin'

        Then one day, M'Lady came, and stopped the clocks from tickin'
        she curdled milk, aborted cows, and stopped my stamps from stickin'!

                (chorus)

        Away out here they have a name for everything worth seein'
        but if M'Lady looks at you, then soon you will be fleein'

        M'Lady disappeared one day, and that for sure is scary
        she was the result of experiments by a deranged Vetinary!

                    WEAPONS AT THE DOOR

 Being a Polemic concerning the alleged Custom of the West Kingdom concerning 
 checking your Weapons at the Door of the Revel Hall. As the Satire is the 
 Weapon of the Bard, this said Polemic is to be checked at the Door, along with 
 swords, knives, redheaded Ladies and other such Deadly Things.....

         As I roved out to Western Lands to take the Western Air
         I went into a Revel Hall and I saw a Twelfth Night there
         but I was halted at the gate by a Privy Consellor
                 (that's the man who tells the King of the West how to go to
                  the bath room!)
         who told me I would have to check my Weapons at the door

         As I, in my astonishment, stood hung on tenter-pegs
         a Knight came in whose Prouess hung down between his legs
         the Doorman grabbed a greatsword and he struck the Knight full sore
         and gave him a reciept; he left his weapon at the door!

         a Bard was next whose goodly Voice has entertained us all
         but he, too, was prevented from entering the Hall
         and told he could not carry deadly weapons on the floor
         he left his Voice and Harp among the weapons at the door

         a Master entered graciously, a man we all know well
         who holds a 3rd Dan Black Belt, tho this he'd never tell
         the Master struggled valiantly, the Master cursed and swore
         but he left his hands, and feet, as weapons at the door

         the company was jovial, altho a bit dismayed
         for lack of proper cutlery, down to the smallest blade
         for even teeth and fingernails, each can be used in War
         were cut, and pulled, and left behind, as weapons at the door!

         And has their King not loyal Knights that He must be afraid
         of brawling in his Hall and of Assassin's bloody blade?
         the Rights of Men to carry Arms at least WE'VE not foreswore
         and a POX on them that made the Rule of Weapons at the Door!

                           THE STREETS OF ANN ARBOR

               As I walked out thru the streets of Ann Arbor
               as I walked out thru Ann Arbor one day
               I spied a young Mongol all dressed in white linen
               all dressed in white linen and cold as the clay

               I then spied another, done in on the sidewalk
               along with just about six dozen more
               their wounds were all gaping, from mace and from braoadsword
               from claymore and cannon, all dripping with gore

               what caused this grave carnage, I cried to the Monglos
               oh pray what's the reason for this awful sight
               my answer came slowly from under the corpse-pile
               ""It seems that our bark is much worse than our bite.....""

               the answer continued from pale lips a-shaking
               we sang all our songs and believed them as true
               the Dark Horde could never be beaten in battle
               we thought this was what all good Mongols could do...

               we went down to Atenveldt all for to plunder
               ""too large to defend"" was our song every night
               but Atenveldt's different from East, West or Middle
               there, even the bushes have learned how to bite!

               the Clann stole our ponies, the Scraelings our foodstuffs
               we ran into axes in AtenViking hands
               our maidens ran off with one Richard of Arkham
               and we're all that's left to return to our lands

               MacChluarains and Monsters, Lockehaven and Foxmoor
               that Kingdom is BIG and its' fighters are MEAN!
               we fought and we lost, and fled back to Ann Arbor
               we all came back home with results that you've seen

               keep away from that Land with its' cactus and marshes
               it's no place for Mongols who are bent on War
               they count their blows well, but they strick them yet better
               he crawled into his Yurt, and fell, dead, on the floor.....

       tune: the song of the Cowardly Lion, Tin Woodsman and Scarecrow
             in the movie version of the Wizard of Oz

        (Enter the Scarecrow, who singeth:)

        My wife is always nagging; my Prowess it is lagging
        I can't do anything
        she has got a reason, but revenge is out of season
        Oh I wish I could be King!

        If I just had the Crown on, I'd always have a frown on
        and the Barons on a string
        Heads they would be rolling, the Board would be cajoling
        Oh if only I was King!

        I am very fed up with the way this group is set up
        Oh I'd change everything!
        they are so high and mighty with the way that they do fight-ey
        Oh, someday I'll be King!

        Tho my wife is melancholic, and very...vitriolic
        she's a wasp without a sting!
        I'd have to supervise her with a pack of tranquilizers
        If I only was a King......

        (the Tin Woodsman joineth him, and singeth:)

        I grew up kind of cocky, and rather big, and stocky
        and straight as any rod
        on the field I'm a battallion, with the Ladies I'm a stallion
        ...Oh they'd better make me God!

        The other boys are jealous they say I'm over-zealous
        they'd do better to applaud
        the things that I am giving to this Dream that we are living
        oh I wish they'd make me God!

        They say that I'm conceited, but I'm just badly treated
        by people and by BoD
        just think of what they're missing by My Majesty dismissing
        Oh they'd better make me God!

        (the Cowardly Lion creepeth forth, and singeth:)

        Oh I could be a fighter, a great and mighty smiter
        and be the perfect knight
        it's a great and nasty shame, and everyone's to blame
        oh I wish that I could fight!

        Song of the Three (cont.)

        I could be a Cavalier drinking wine and ale and beer
        and be a gorgeous sight
        but it would cost me too much money so it isn't very funny
        oh I wish that I could fight!                               

        Let me at 'em on the field, I would surely make them yield
        to my Power and my Might
        with rattan, shinai and rapier they would nevermore escape here
        If they'd only let me fight

                She was afraid to come out to the Tourney
                She was worried that ""something might show..""
                She was afraid to come out to the Tourney
                And the poor thing did NOT want to go...

                The Mongols invaded the Middle
                But the Middle did not want to play...

                  (eins - zwei - drei, but the Dark Horde wouldn't die!)

          FIRST you plunder, THEN you burn! That's how to be rakehelly!

          But I prefer a coarser cloth over silk or satins
          English is more understood, mine enemies to flatten!

          Good People all, I've made my Song, its' music's well-recited
          But my voice could use some work; the flowers it has blighted!
          It's rude and rusty, grim and bad, and squeaky like a door-hinge,
          But I'm a better Bard than you: I found a rhyme for ""orange!""

                      by William Poundstone
                              1983

     Two mentalities are at work here: 1960s rock fans and 1980s
fundamentalist Christians. The idea of phonographically concealed
messages dates from the Paul McCartney death scare of 1969. For
hard-core types, the secret-message rumors never really died. Avid
rock fans have auditioned ever album release since the late 1960s
for hidden nuances. Backward messages, barely audible messages,
and messages on one stereo track only have been alleged. At the
other end of the sociosensual spectrum, fundamentalist Christians
have gotten into the act. TV programs such as PRAISE THE LORD and
THE 700 CLUB have propagated rumors of a satanic plot in the
recording industry, no less, in which various albums conceal
""backward-masked"" demonic murmurings. If THAT sounds too spacey to
be taken seriously, consider that it was the fundamentalist groups
who were behind House Resolution 6363, a bill introduced in the
U.S. House of Representatives by Robert K. Dornan (R., Calif.) in
1982 to label all suspect records: ""WARNING: THIS RECORD CONTAINS
BACKWARD MASKING THAT MAKES A VERBAL STATEMENT WHICH IS AUDIBLE
WHEN THIS RECORD IS PLAYED BACKWARD AND WHICH MAY BE PERCEPTIBLE
AT A SUBLIMINAL LEVEL WHEN THIS RECORD IS PLAYED FORWARD."" In
February 1983, the Arkansas State Senate passed a similar record-
labeling bill by a vote of 86 to 0.
     Contributing to the quasi-occult status of these rumors is
the difficulty of checking them out on home audio equipment. You
pretty much have to take someone else's word for it, or dismiss
the rumors out of hand.
     From a technical standpoint, there are four simple ways to
conceal a verbal message on a recording. The most obvious is to
record the message at a very low volume. The message may then be
recovered by turning the volume up while playing the record or
tape. If the message is faint enough, though, noise levels of home
equipment may garble it. If the accompanying music or lyrics are
loud enough, or if the message itself is indistinct or
electronically modified, it may be hard to hear on any equipment.
     A second gimmick is to record a message on one stereo track
only. Records and tapes have two independent recordings, of
course, normally played simultaneously for stereo effect. On a
record, each stereo track occupies on one side of the V-shaped
groove for the needle. On a tape, the tracks are recorded in
parallel lanes of the magnetic material. The two tracks are called
""right"" and ""left"" after the stereo speakers they will play on.
Otherwise, the tracks are interchangeable -- the sound mixer can
put anything he or she wants on each track. A message on one track
can be masked by simultaneous loud music or lyrics on the opposite
track. With normal stereo balance (or mono equipment) the loud
track drowns out the message track. At home, single-track messages
can be recovered by adjusting the stereo balance so that only the
desired track plays. Sometimes this trick also makes indistinct
words clearer. Even if the words are not exclusively on one track,
they may happen to be more audible on one track.
     A message could be recorded at a speed different from the
rest of the record. Then the record would have to be played faster
or slower than usual to recover the message. Unless the message
was at one of the standard speeds (say, 45 rpm on a 33 1/3 rpm
record), it could not be played normally on home equipment.
     The fourth and most commonly alleged trick is to record a
verbal message backward. Reversed speech has several unexpected
features. One is that syllables are not a constant in the reversal
process. A one-syllable word can have two or three syllables when
played backward. Thus ""number nine"" in the Beatles' REVOLUTION 9
reverses to ""Turn me on, dead man"" (or something like it), a jump
from three to five syllables.
     There is no simple way to predict what a word or phrase will
sound like reversed. Obviously, you can't just reverse the
letters.
     Reversed messages are difficult to recover at home. Record
turntables are not built to go backwards. Some have a neutral
setting, in which the pickup and amplifier remain active and you
can turn the record backward by hand. But hardly anyone has a
stead enough hand to produce satisfactory results.
     With patience, it is possible to reverse a cassette
recording. Transfer the music from the original record or tape
onto a blank tape cassette. Place the cassette flat on a table.
Draw our the part of the tape with the suspected message and snip
it off at both ends. Hold the tape segment horizontally. Rotate it
180 degrees, keep it horizontal at all times. This turns the tape
end for end. Splice the reversed tape segment back onto the two
loose ends of the cassette with strong adhesive tape. Reel the
tape back inside the cassette. The sliced segment will play
backward on an ordinary cassette player.
     I rented a recording studio to test the secret-message
rumors. New copiies of the records in question were transcribed on
a quarter-inch master tape. Where rumor alleged that a single
stereo track contained a message, right and left stereo tracks
were transcribed separately. Records with alleged inaudible
messages were treated similarly. To test claims of reversed
messages, recordings on the master tape were edited out and
spliced in backward. Twenty cuts or portions of cuts from sixteen
albums were tested.


""Another One Bites the Dust""
Queen, THE GAME

Rumor: When played backward, the lyrics say, ""It's fun to smoke
marijuana.""
Findings: There is something that sounds like ""It's fun to smoke
marijuana"" in the reversed music. It is repeated over and over. It
might be rendered no less faithfully, however, as ""sfun to scout
mare wanna."" This ""message"" is the reversal of the song title,
which is repeated as a line in the song.
     Let's make a distinction between engineered and phonetic
reversals. When an artist records a verbal statement, reverses it
by turning the tape end for end, mixes the reversed statement onto
a master tape, and has records and tapes produced from the master,
that is an engineered reversal. When the phonetic properties of
song lyrics are such that they can be reversed to sound like
something else, that is a phonetic reversal.
     ""It's fun to smoke marijuna"" is clearly a phonetic reversal.
The lyrics are perfectly plain played forward (""Another one bites
the dust""), no so plain played backward (""sfun to scout mare
wanna""). With an engineered reversal, the opposite should hold
true: gibberish forward, clear as a bell backward. Some are
prepared to believe that phonetic reversals are just as
intentional as engineered reversals -- that the songwriter
painstakinginly planned the phonetic double-entendre. In the
absence of confirming evidence, that just doesn't wash. It's too
easy to find coincidences. If, for example, the letters of the
alphabet are recited in conventional fashion (Ay, Bee, Cee, etc.)
and reversed, at least five sound like English language words. D
reverses to ""eden,"" F becomes ""pray,"" S becomes ""say,"" V becomes
""even,"" and Z becomes ""easy."" ""It's fun to smoke marijuana"" is
likewise a coincidence.


""A Child is Coming""
Jefferson Starship, BLOWS AGAINST THE EMPIRE

Rumor: When played backward, ""son of Satan.""
Findings: Another phonetic coincidence. The repeated ""It's getting
better"" reverses to an iffy ""son of Satan,"" the ""of"" drawn out and
the ""Satan"" strongly accented on the first syllable.


""Eldorado""
Electric Light Orchestra, ELDORADO

Rumor: When played backward, ""He is the nasty one/ Christ, you're
infernal/ It is said we're dead men/ Everyone who has the mark
will live.""
Findings: Coincidence. The supposed message lurks around the line
""On a voyage of no return to see."" Reversed, this passage becomes
the expected syllable salad -- no one hearing it would describe it
as anything but reversed music. Only if you listen while reading
along with what you're supposed to hear will you get anything. The
rumored version of the message is somewhat fudged. The passage
sounds more like ""He's to nasty one/ Christ you are, Christ,
you're fernal/ There wiss uh, we're dead men..."" There is no ""in""
in what is taken to be ""infernal."" The line that is supposed to be
""Everyone who has the mark will live"" isn't even close, though the
syllable count is right.


""Shoo Be Doo""
The Cars, CANDY-O

Rumor: When played backward, the word ""Satan"" repeated
approximately eleven times.
Findings: Coincidence. The rumor refers to the reversal of the ""Shoo
be doo, shoo be doo, shoo be doo..."" near the end of the song. Given
the mysterious logic of reversed phonemes, these three-syllable units
can be hard as a repeated two-syllable word. The word sounds a little
like ""Satan.""


""Snowblind""
Styx, PARADISE THEATER

Rumor: According to a mimeographed list of suspect records distributed
by Congressman Dornan, the words ""Satan move through our voices"" when
played backwards.
Findings: Negative. Despite repeated listenings, it was not even
possible to identify the part of the reversed track that Dornan et al.
are talking about.


""Stairway to Heaven""
Led Zeppelin, untitled, a.k.a. STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN

Rumor: In reverse, ""I live for Satan... The Lord turns me off...
There's no escaping it... Here's to my sweet Satan... There's power in
Satan... He will give you 666.""
Findings: Coincidence. If you listen very carefully to the ""And it
makes me wonder"" lines in reverse, you'll hear something approaching
""There's no escaping it."" A better description is ""There's no escape
do."" Knock of the last syllable, and you have ""There's no escape,"" a
complete, intelligible sentence in reverse. It's there, all right, but
it's not an unlikely enough coincidence to -- well, make you wonder.
      The ""Satan"" in ""I live for Satan"" is good and clear. The ""I live
for"" part isn't. The other alleged lines are unremarkable. All are
phonetic reversals of the entirely lucid forward lyrics and obviously
just accidents.


""When Electricity Came to Arkansas""
Black Oak Arkansas, BLACK OAK ARKANSAS and RONCH AND ROLL

Rumor: In reverse, ""Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan. He is God. He
is God.""
Findings: The BLACK OAK ARKANSAS cut was reversed. Again, pairs of
reversed syllables are being freely interpreted as ""Satan."" ""He is
God"" was not identifiable.


""Rain""
The Beatles, HEY JUDE

Rumor: Unintelligible lyrics at the end are reversed.
Findings: A true engineered reversal and not really a secret. ""Rain""
seems to have been the first popular recording to incorporate an
obviously reversed lyric. The story is that John Lennon accidentally
spliced the last part of the song in backward and liked the effect.
When reversed, the strange-sounding vocals at the end become
intelligible as a reprise starting with the drawn-out word
""sunshine.""
      The reversal is less apparent to the casual listener than it
might be because the accompanying music is not reversed. The ending
fits in smoothly with the rest of the song, the vocals suggesting a
foreign language.


""Fire on High""
Electric Light Orchestra, FACE THE MUSIC

Rumor: When played backward, ""The music is reversible, but time --
turn back!""
Findings: ""Fire on High"" is instrumental. About twenty-six seconds
into the music, scrambled speech is heard. It is mostly louder than
the accompanying music and begins with a two-syllable unit repeated
several times. The seeming speech lasts for about fourteen seconds.
      Reversing the music confirms that there is a true, engineered
message. In reverse, a voice (Jeff Lynne's?) says, ""The music is
reversible, but time -- turn back! Turn back! Turn back! Turn back!""
All the words are clear and unambiguous. Anyone comparing this to the
alleged reversal on ELO's ""Eldorado"" will have no trouble telling
which is genuine.


""Goodbye Blue Sky""
Pink Floyd, THE WALL

Rumor: In reverse, ""You have discovered the secret message.""
Findings: The ""secret message"" is at the very end of the instrumental
passage following the ""Goodbye Blue Sky"" vocals. It comes just before
the words ""What shall we do"" at the start of the song that is
identified as ""Empty Spaces"" on the record label and as ""What shall we
do now?"" on the record sleeve. Played forward, the message is less
apparent than the FACE THE MUSIC reversal: A reasonably attentive
listener might play THE WALL through and not catch it. It suggests
speech not quite close enough to be overheard. In context this is not
unusual because the ""Goodbye Blue Sky"" instrumental passage includes
""airport noises"" and other sound effects. A loud climax in the music
further masks the unintelligible voice.
      When played backward, the voice (Roger Waters?) plainly intones,
""Congratulations, you have just discovered the secret message. Please
send your answer to old Pink, care of the funny farm..."" As the voice
fades out, there may be another word -- perhaps ""Chalfonte or
""Chelsea"" -- after ""funny farm.""


""Heavy Metal Poisoning""
Styx, KILROY WAS HERE

Rumor: A red sticker on the KILROY WAS HERE cover warns, ""By order of
the Majority for Musical Morality, this album contains secret backward
messages...""
Findings: This is a case of second-generation backward-masking. Styx'
PARADISE THEATER did not contain a backward message, though a lot of
people said it did. So Styx has included a sure enough backward
message on KILROY WAS HERE. It is at the very beginning of ""Heavy
Metal Poisoning."" The reversed speech last about three seconds. There
is no musical background. The words reverse to ""Annuit coeptis. Novus
ordo seclorum."" This is the Latin motto encircling the pyramid on the
back of a dollar bill. The usual translation: ""God has favored our
undertakings. A new order of the ages.""
      The cover sticker's ""Majority for Musical Morality"" is a
fictitious Falwellesque group in the KILROY WAS HERE video. Although
the sticker suggests a plurality of ""messages,"" only one was found.


Space between ""I'm So Tired"" and ""Blackbird""
The Beatles, untitled, a.k.a. THE WHITE ALBUM

Rumor: A reversed message. At the time of the Paul-is-dead stories,
the segue from ""I'm So Tired"" to ""Blackbird"" was offered as evidence.
It was held to contain John Lennon's voice, reveresed, saying ""Paul is
dead, miss him, miss him, miss him."" That interpretation seems
unlikely now, but there is a mysterious low muttering between the
songs.
Findings: The mumbling is actually just to the ""I'm So Tired"" side of
the shiny ""space"" between cuts on the record. Each of the stereo
tracks was recorded separately, twice, and a copy of each track was
reversed. This produced four versions of the two-second passage: right
forward, left forward, right reversed, and left reversed. All were
equally unintelligible. It was not even apparent whether the voice is
forward or reversed. Nor could John Lennon be identified as the
speaker. There are nine or ten syllables. The first six (when played
forward) are a two-syllable unit repeated three times. There is little
or no difference betwen the stereo tracks. Any claimed interpretation
of the sounds seems doubtful.


""Strawberry Fields Forever""
The Beatles, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR

Rumor: It was, of course, claimed that John Lennon says ""I buried
Paul"" at the end. (It's forward, at the very end after the music
fades to complete silence, returns, and starts to fade out again.)
But Lennon told ROLLING STONE that the words are ""cranberry
sauce.""
Findings: They are ""cranberry sauce."" The ""sauce""/""Paul"" part is
indistinct, but the first syllable sounds a lot more like ""cran""
than ""I.""


""Baby You're a Rich Man""
The Beatles, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR

Rumor: On one of the tracks the line ""Baby you're a rich man too""
is sung as ""Baby you're a rich fag Jew,"" a dig at Brian Epstein.
Or some think it's ""rich fat Jew"" and claim it as evidence of
Beatle anti-Semitism.
Findings: Negative. The two stereo tracks are nearly identical.
It's always possible to hear words as similar-sounding words, but
basically, the lyrics jibe with the published version.


""Revolution 9""
The Beatles, untitled, a.k.a. THE WHITE ALBUM

Rumor: Various reversed and/or one-track speech. The reversal of
""Number nine"" to ""Turn me on, dead man"" has pretty much been
discounted as coincidence (though it appears on Congressman
Dornan's list).
Findings: Distinction between lyrics and any hidden message blurs
on ""Revolution 9."" The eight-minute cut is a montage of sounds
collected by John Lennon and Yoko Ono. It includes discordant
music, radio broadcasts, sirens, applause, gunfights, sports
cheers, the crackling of a fire, screams, a baby gurgling, a choir
singing, and much that cannot be identified. For this
investigation, ""Revolution 9"" was transcribed four times, twice on
each stereo channel. One copy of each of the tracks was reversed.
The four resulting versions were compared with each other and
against the original two-channel version.
     ""Revolution 9"" contains a lot of talking. Played in stereo,
forward, the longest stretch of understandable speech is probably
an announcer saying, ""...every one of them knew that as time went
by they'd get a little bit older and a little bit slower...""
     One believable instance of reversed speech occurs: someone
saying ""Let me out! Let me out!"" (once held to represent McCartney
in his totaled Aston-Martin). Two iffy reversals occur on the
backward recording of the right stereo track:""She used to be
assistant"" and ""There were two men..."" Neither is clear enough or
long enough to be convincing. Some of the music, including the
recurring theme, sounds more natural in reverse.
     ""Turn me on, dead man"" is a typical phonetic reversal. The
forward ""number nine"" (repeated throughout the cut) is clear; the
reversal is slurred -- something like ""turn me on dedmun."" It has
been claimed that ""number nine"" must be pronounced with a British
accent or with some careful inflection in order to reverse to
""Turn me on, dead man."" This seems not to be so. As an experiment,
three American-accent renderings of ""number nine"" were reversed.
All sound about as much like ""Turn me on, dead man"" as the record
did. Like the other phonetic reversals, ""Turn me on, dead man""
must be considered a coincidence.
     Much of ""Revolution 9"" is on one stereo track only. Near the
end a voice says ""A fine natural imbalance...the Watusi...the
twist...Eldorado...Eldorado."" ""A fine natural imbalance"" is on the
right track only, though the words that follow are in stereo. One
of the longer bits of speech -- ""Who could tell what he was
saying? His voice was low and his [unintelligible] was high and
his eyes were low"" -- is clear on the left track, a bare whisper
on the right.
     There is a stereophonically concealed ""secret message"" on
""Revolution 9."" The words are on the right track. They begin about
four minutes, fifty-eight seconds into the cut and run for about
twenty-two seconds. They are not likely to be noticed in stereo
because of the much louder left track. The sound of applause
begins on the left track at about five minutes, one second into
the cut. Deafening noises -- the clapping, sirens, music --
continue on the left track until five minutes, forty seconds. It
may or may not have been Lennon's and Ono's intention to conceal
the spoken passage. Given the haphazard quality of ""Revolution 9,""
the concealment may have been accidental. To recover the passage,
the left track must be switched off. The right track can then be
heard to contain a sound like a stopwatch ticking, behind these
words:

     So the wife called, and we better go to see a
     surgeon....[A SCREAM MUFFLES A LINE THAT SOUNDS LIKE
     Well, what with the prices, the prices have snowballed,
     no wonder it's closed.] ...So any and all, we went to
     see the dentist instead, who gave him a pair of teeth,
     which wasn't any good at all. So instead of that he
     joined the bloody navy and went to sea.
                      by William Poundstone
                              1986

     There really are backward messages on rock albums. And the
controversy over ""backward masking"" and ""porn rock"" has inspired a
whole new spate of messages. There may have been more genuine
backward messages in the past few years than ever before.
     The backward message controversy is usually traced to the
1960s and John Lennon's avant-garde sound mixing on such tracks as
""Revolution 9"" on the Beatles' WHITE ALBUM. Lennon probably wasn't
trying to conceal a message so much as create an interesting
sound.
     The matter might have ended right there had it not been for
the Paul McCartney death rumor. College kids tried playing Beatles
records forward, backward, and at various speeds to find ""clues""
to McCartney's fate. In the process they found snippets of speech
from Lennon's experiments. Even after McCartney was found safe and
sound in Scotland, some listeners continued to look for hidden
messages.
     Somehow, fundamentalist Christian groups became convinced
(ca. 1982) that the alleged messages were commercials for devil
worship. Not a single indisputable satanic message has turned up,
but there were scattered attempts to ban or label certain albums.
In 1986 one fundamentalist group announced that the theme song for
the old MR. ED TV show contains the word ""Satan"" when played
backward.)
     Ironically, the publicity accorded nonexistent messages has
inspired several artists -- among them porn rock hearing witness
Frank Zappa -- to hide real background messages in their music.
It's easy to do.
     The performer speaks or sings the message normally, then
reverses the tape, which is mixed into the soundtrack. This is all
accomplished simply enough at any recording studio.
     What's not so simple is playing it back. More home record,
cassette, and compact disk players won't play backward. You can
turn a record backward with a pencil eraser, but it's not good for
the needle or the turntable. The only way to reproduce the message
with full fidelity is to use a professional-quality reel-to-reel
tape player and splice the tape in backward.
     We used the facilities of KLOS radio in Los Angeles to
reverse some recent records containing true backward messages.


""Secret Messages""
Electric Light Orchestra, SECRET MESSAGES

ELO's ELDORADO album was among those alleged to contain satanic
backward masked messages. A patient listening to ELDORADO played
backward reveals no such messages. You hear only what you ought to
hear -- the reversed lyrics of the songs, which sound nothing like
the ""messages"" claimed to be there. In the wake of such
allegations, ELO did put an (innocuous) backward message on their
FACE THE MUSIC album. Perhaps they thought this would show how
silly the allegations were. Instead, the backward-masking people
seized on this as proof that the other ""messages"" were real. In
the latest volley, ELO has named an album after the controversy.
     In Britain (where the backward-masking issue is viewed as an
American eccentricity), the cover of SECRET MESSAGES has a mock
warning label to youth about the hidden label. Word of the albums'
impending release in the United States caused enough of a furor to
chill CBS Records into deleting the cover blurb.
     The reversed message is easy to find. It's at the beginning
of the first song, which is itself called ""Secret Messages."" You
can hear reversed speech when you play the record normally. A
voice intones ""secret messages"" -- forward -- in the middle of the
reversed speech, lest anyone dare be so unhip as to not know
what's going on.
     We transferred a new copy of SECRET MESSAGES to reel-to-reel
tapes and played it backward. The backward message goes: ""WELCOME
TO THE BIG SHOW/ WELCOME TO THE BIG SHOW.""
     That's it.


""Ya Hozna""
Frank Zappa, THEM OR US

""Ya Hozna,"" a six-minute composition on the first record of the
THEM OR US double album, is ENTIRELY backward. The albums' inner
cover, which includes lyrics for the other songs, says, ""backwards
vocal -- you figure it out"" of this cut. It credits Frank and Moon
Zappa, George Duke, and Napoleon Murphy Brock as vocalists.
     Played forward, ""Ya Howza"" sounds like a record played
backward -- reasonably so. The vocals are prominent and
unintelligible. Moon Zappa's voice is curiously recognizable, even
in reverse. It is hard to tell whether the music was recorded
forward or backward.
     When ""Ya Howza"" is played in reverse, you discover that the
music is virtually a palindrome -- it sounds about the same
forward and backward. The voices are all backward. In some cases
they have been modified electronically. Many of the words are
muffled. Even after repeated careful listening on both stereo
tracks, it is difficult to make out many of the lyrics. It doesn't
help that some of the words seem to be stream-of-consciousness
nonsense. Some of the unintelligible stuff sounds like opera.
     Starting at the beginning of the reversed tape -- the end of
the forward tape -- the clearer vocals go like this: ""I am the
heaven, I am the water."" This is in a hymnlike register. ""You are
a lonely little girl./ But your mommy and your daddy hold you."" A
singsong synthesizer voice.
     The most interesting part of the lyrics is an intermittently
orgasmic rap in Moon Zappa's Valley Girl voice. There are three
short monologues:

I'm like green!
I'm like squat!
I'm like soul!
Repeat, like soul!
I'm like pull, push,
Okay, like slow, slow.

You're never too old
Like slow, like slow, like slow
Okay, I like it.


All right, faster, faster,
Go, do it, do it twice,
Yeah, that feels good,
I'm looking great,
Yeah, fer shure!
Like, no way!


""No Anchovies, Please""
J. Geils Band, LOVE STINKS

""No Anchovies, Please"" is a novelty song, really a narration with
sound effects, about a woman who is kidnapped after eating
anchovies. She is taken to a ""foreign-speaking"" country. The sound
effect of the foreign tongue seems reversed. When you do play it
in reverse, it becomes: ""It doesn't take a genius to know the
difference between chicken shit and chicken salad.""


""Darling Nikki""
Prince, PURPLE RAIN

""Darling Nikki,"" cited as porn rock before Congress, is about a
dominatrix in a hotel lobby masturbating with a magazine. In part,
the complaint was that the album cover (flowers, and Prince on a
motorcycle) wasn't explicit enough to warn kids of the suggestive
lyrics. Senator Paula Hawkins apparently was not aware of a
backward message hidden in ""Darling Nikki."" The last thirty-five
seconds of the song is gibberish. The music changes abruptly and
becomes a repeated glottal sound. Then a two-syllable sound is
repeated twice, something like ""heaven, heaven."" Unintelligible
speech follows. At the end is a sound reminiscent of rain or bacon
frying , and wind sounds.
     Played backward, the message becomes:

     Hello, how are you?
     I'm fine 'cause I know that the Lord is coming soon.
     Coming, coming soon.

     It is clearly Prince and the Revolution singing this. The
words are clear but the intonation is funny -- the linger on some
words. Perhaps this is to make the reversed message you hear
playing the record normally a little less conspicuous.
     This is a weird reversal of the supposed secret message
menace. Raunchy forward lyrics conceal a religious secret message.


""Judas Kiss""
Petra, MORE POWER TO YOU

Petra is an obscure group that sings religious songs to a rock
beat. As further proof that things have gone full circle, the
backward-masking controversy prompted Petra to include a wholesome
backward message on their MORE POWER TO YOU album. It is in the
transition between two songs, just before ""Judas Kiss."" Clearly
audible gibberish reverses to this (the husky voice a cross
between George Beverly Shea and Dee Snider): ""What are you looking
for the Devil for, when you ought to be looking for the Lord?""

AFL JoyceM Welcome to the Apple II Music & Sound chat - our discussion will
           be on NoiseTracker - the new FTA music program for the GS.  AFA
           Gene will be our host this evening...Gene, the floor is yours :)

AFA Gene   Hi all... well first I'd like to point out, if y'all aren't aware
           yet, that a spanking new version of NoiseTracker has recently
           been released (9 days ago) and is now available in our New Files
           library. It is version 0.5. I haven't played around with it much
           yet, but it's supposed to fix a lot of the little bugs in 0.3
           (the first version we had online).  NoiseTracker also includes
           the ability to directly import ""modules,"" a term used for a
           certain type of Amiga song file which has become popular among PC
           users using the SoundBlaster sound card.

           Now, via NT, these ""MOD"" files are accessible by the GS. We
           expect to see a lot of activity on this end as far as ports from
           the PC and Amiga go. Note that you should be able to go straight
           to the PC music forum and download any recently uploaded MOD
           songfiles (there was a bug in the first wide release of the PCAO
           software, however, so a bunch of files with dates between around
           March 1991 and September 1991 may not download properly. Note that
           to use these PC MOD files, you'll have to rename the downloaded
           file ""MOD.xxxxxx"" if you want it to show up automatically in NT's
           ""open"" dialog box. (On the PC, all MOD files are named
           ""xxxxxxxx.MOD"" instead.)   Also, if the files are packed with ZIP
           compression, you'll need a program from the Communications Forum
           called AGATE -- it's a terminal program that includes the ability
           to unpack ZIP files.

           Now, I guess the best thing to do would be to talk about our
           favorite songfiles... there have been a few complaints, in fact,
           that people were not being ""descriptive"" enough in their file
           descriptions for uploads in describing the songs.

AFC Eddie  ?

AFA Gene   GA ed

AFC Eddie  Once a MOD file is unpacked with Agate, is a file type change
           needed?

AFA Gene   Nope, since all that NT looks for is the ""MOD."" being the first
           four characters in the filename.

AFC Eddie  OK, Thanks!

Deanna7332 Question...

JonL7      Can you list some of the features of Noisetracker?

AFA Gene   (you don't even need that ""MOD."" if you want to type the name in
           directly.)

Deanna7332 Did any of these mod files have anything to do with FTA's ""Module
           A""

AFA Gene   Sure Jon, right after we answer Deanna's question. Deanna, you
           mean ""Modulae?""

Deanna7332 Yes, that's it.

AFA Gene   Modulae was a demo written by FTA last year. (i'll get to you in a
           sec Doors).  It used SoundSmith v0.95 for all it's music. There
           is no connection between MOD files and Modulae by FTA.

Deanna7332 Throughout the demo it said ""Loading modules""

AFA Gene   Those ""modules"" are not the same as Amiga soundfile ""modules"" --
           you see, what Modulae really was was a ""stringing together"" of a
           bunch of neat little tiny demos that FTA had written. So they
           called each little demo a ""module"" and thus the entire demo as a
           whole, ""Modulae"" (fancy plural of module?)

Deanna7332 Ok I understand.  Thank you. :)

AFL JoyceM Latin, Gene :)

AFA Gene   The term ""MODule"" from the Amiga comes from the idea that all the
           stuff needed to play the songfile (all the instruments + the
           sequence file) are included into one file, the ""module.""

TheDoors1  Gene, I have tried to d/l some recent uploaded MODs in the PC
           music area and still the problem exists.

AFA Gene   As I understand it, the problem was fixed VERY recently (correct
           me on this Joyce) and files uploaded as recently as early
           November still might not work depending on the version of the
           PCAO software that the uploader used.

AFL JoyceM Actually, Gene...I was under the impression that it had been, but
           if Doors is still having a problem, then it must not be fixed.

AFA Gene   What date was the file you tried to d/l, Door?

TheDoors1  umm 11/17, around there

AFA Gene   hmmm.... well i can tell you one thing... if it didn't work, don't
           waste your time again later... the problem is in the Apple
           software's method of d/lling files, and there are no plans to
           upgrade the Apple AO software.

AFL JoyceM I will endeavor to get an answer to that PC downloading
           problem/question :)

ThomasK63  i have a quick question... what can you use to unpack amiga mod
           files? On the PC side, that is.

TheDoors1  Agate Thomas

ELECTMUSIC Doors... what happens on after downloading..

Deanna7332 If it's LZHed you can't unless you have an IBM or
           PC/Transporter.

AFA Gene   If GS-ShrinkIt doesn't have that ability, i don't think there
           exists any such utility on the GS.

TheDoors1  What do you mean Elect?

ELECTMUSIC After you download the file... where do you encounter a problem?

TheDoors1  ok, you know when you download the file and at some point in the
           download the file starts to appear on your screen.  That's when I
           cancel it.

ThomasK63  I am sure soething good can be made w/out resorting to Amiga
           files

AFC Eddie  Yes, Doors, I believe the problem is with the PC software it was
           UL'd with.

TheDoors1  yeah Eddie.

GNO Tim    Amiga MOD files are typically compressed using LHarc.  I've
           uncompressed several on my Unix machine at school.

ThomasK63  good time for someone to make a lharc unpacker...

AFC DYAJim someone might be ;)

GNO Tim    Several people are already

AFC Eddie  Can't wait, Jim!

AFA Gene   Jon, did you have a question?

JonL7      The features of Noisetracker :)

AFA Gene   Oh yes... okay, here goes, in a nutshell, from most important to
           least:


AFA Gene   *  ability to import MOD files

           *  ability to import Soundsmith files

           *  ProDOS 8 based

           *  virtually no editing abilities (not a feature but important to
           know)

AFC DYAJim :)

AFA Gene   *  forgot: and the most important feature of all, the ability to
           hold instrument files in regular system RAM instead of DOC RAM,
           allowing for instruments far beyond the regular 64K limit found
           in ALL other GS music programs.

ThomasK63  I'll buy that!

TheDoors1  I have another question...when you're ready.

AFA Gene   GA Doors

TheDoors1  ok..is it true that NoiseTracker will take in soundsmith files and
           play them more clearly

AFA Gene   Well, as far as ""what you hear,"" yes there is a definite
           difference with some instruments. It does NOT play the sounds
           more ""clearly,"" but it just plays them in a different way. What
           many people seem to like about this ""different way"" is that
           sustained instruments (i.e. instruments designed to be played
           in a loop to simulate a long held note) seem to work better (or
           perhaps simply the way they were originally intended to work).

TheDoors1  I see

Deanna7332 Which takes up more space - MOD or NT  w/soundfile ?

AFA Gene   Deanna, it depends a few things, such as how big the sequence is,
           how many instruments you have, etc. Once you have a lot of
           assorted files, it'll probably average out to be about the same
           give or take a hundred blocks on your HD. So it basically depends
           on whether you prefer to have your instruments separate or not.

Deanna7332 Does playing quality differ with either one ?

AFA Gene   Nope. It's exactly the same either way. Loading time is the same
           too.

AFC Eddie  Can NT save songs as MOD files?

AFA Gene   Nope. It has options for Open and Close module, but these are
           still inactive.

AFA Gene   If there are no more questions, I'd like to talk about which NT
           files out there are the ""hottest,"" since this info could be
           useful to many users who are interested in downloading NT/MOD
           files.

           My personal favorite is ""Lambada,"" which is supplied by FTA with
           the program but is available separately on America
           Online.Everything about this file is really impressive except
           perhaps the sound quality of the horn-ish melody instrument.

           What about y'all, what are your favorite NT files?

AFL JoyceM Gene, there is a classical song for NT, but can't remember the
           name, but it is good.

AFC Eddie  I like Dragnet!

ELECTMUSIC So do I Ed

TheDoors1  I like Seven something

Deanna7332 My most favorite of all mod files is Pleasure Principle

AFC Eddie  <--appreciate's Greg's taste!

AFL JoyceM :)

AFA Gene   Deanna, i assume you got that from a local board?

Deanna7332 I got it from the PC forum here.

TheDoors1  I saw it there also

Deanna7332 I think under ""Pleasure""

AFA Gene   Would you be able to upload it here? If it's really that good, we
           ought to have it available directly in our oun NT lib here (BTW
           folks, we will be releasing a new NoiseTracker software library
           soon!)

AFC Eddie  What a Forum!!!

Deanna7332 That sounds great!

AFL JoyceM Gene, do you think it will be possible for synthLAB files to be
           converted to MOD files?

AFL JoyceM MOD files?

AFA Gene   I doubt it, Joyce. The formats are so diametrically opposed in
           their entire basis of their file formats that it wouldn't be
           worth the time for a programmer to develop such a convertor.

Deanna7332 Isn't it possible to move the mod file from the PC forum to our
           music library?

AFA Gene   But..... it might be worth the time for a MIDI File Format to MOD
           convertor, since these two formats are more widely accepted.

Nuzz       they have nothing better to do Gene

ELECTMUSIC Gene.. some interesting similarities with DTune and NTracker

AFA Gene   They lose the file, tho, Deanna. :)

AFL JoyceM In what way, Greg?

ELECTMUSIC Both Prodos 8

Deanna7332 Shhh they won't know a thing :)

ELECTMUSIC I also believe Bill uses a shuttling of sound data between Doc
           Ram and Ram.

AFC Eddie  Interesting, Greg.

ELECTMUSIC Thats how he gets some of the excellent instrument quality

AFC Eddie  But Diversitune has that one distinction:  MIDI input.

AFL JoyceM Deanna, we would greatly appreciate it if you would upload that
           'Pleasure' song to our library :)

ELECTMUSIC Agreed Ed.. one of the factors FTA doesn't like to incorporate
           into their programs.

Deanna7332 I'll u/l it tonight if possible.

AFL JoyceM Thanks :)

AFC Eddie  Thanks, Deanna!

AFL JoyceM I will send Bill B a copy of NoiseTracker + some MOD files...to
           see what comments we get from him (will send when I get back).

AFC DYAJim What ever happened to that diversitune upgrade that was talked
           about ?

ELECTMUSIC That would be interesting Joyce

AFC Eddie  Bill apparently still working on it, Jim.

ELECTMUSIC I am sure he would appreciate the Prodos 8

AFC DYAJim good..

AFL JoyceM Jim...RSN....he was hoping by Christmas (this year), but he is
           soooo busy with his job, who knows?

AFC DYAJim Oh yeah, I noticed the speed calcuation in NT .5 is inaccurate
           :)

AFC DYAJim I recall he has set a lot of Christmas projected dates :)

ELECTMUSIC He was one of the first ""Free Tools"" experts in breaking all the
           rules for economic sake.

AFC DYAJim like for the vaporware DT inst editor like 2 years ago.

Deanna7332 Are there any Christmas Mod or NT songs?

AFC Eddie  Oh yeah, Diversi-Editor!

AFL JoyceM I know, Jim - but that I know he has been working on.

AFC DYAJim he projected Christmas for it, and it never came :)

AFA Gene   Not yet in AMS, but hopefully the Holiday Contest will change all
           that. :)

AFC DYAJim I look foreward to any upgrades..

AFL JoyceM Not that I am aware of Deanna - you have some?  hint, hint

Deanna7332 Nope sorry.  I was hoping there were some that could be u/led
           here

AFC DYAJim I'll be breaking out the xmas tune book rsn.. I should be able to
           midi a few :) (which rules out nt)

AFL JoyceM Question...

AFC Eddie  It would be more appropriate to have a converter from Appleworks
           spreadsheet to MOD than from MIDI!

AFL JoyceM If I got ahold of an Amiga song (MOD) disk...how would I convert
           them for here?

AFA Gene   You mean an Amiga-formatted disk?

AFL JoyceM Yes

AFC DYAJim Ack.. methinks you need an amiga and a null modem cable or a
           modem.

AFA Gene   Methinks Jim is right

AFC DYAJim LOL!!  Design your music in the spreadsheet then import to NT :)
           IT might actually have better editing?!! :)

AFC Eddie  Right!

AFL JoyceM Me thinks he is right.  If I had them upload to me, would that
           work?

AFA Gene   Yep; should work like a charm.

AFC DYAJim Yah.. as long as they're coming from an amiga

AFL JoyceM Great....I will work on that when I get back  (making note now).

AFL JoyceM Gene, will you get some of those files (NT) sent to that area
           tonight?  If so, I will leave the needed message :)

AFA Gene   That's all I have planned for tonight's chat, Joyce. Yep, I'll
           move some files right now.

AFL JoyceM Thanks...

AFL JoyceM Then we should have our NoiseTracker Library by end of the week in
           AMS :)

ELECTMUSIC Gene... quick question:  Are you launching NTracker from a 3.5
           disk?

AFL JoyceM Okay, guys...I will see you all the week of December 11th (may the
           4th) as I am off on vacation.

AFA Gene   Yep greg

AFC JohnC  Where are you going?

ELECTMUSIC Do you encounter out of memory problems

AFL JoyceM Night all...and Gene, thanks for an excellent chat and great
           explanations of NoiseTracker.

Nuzz       Joyce, I have good news for FutureSound owners. SoundConvert will
           support it in the first release

AFC Eddie  Great, Mike!

AFA Gene   Greg, i always keep my RAMdisk at 0 when using noisetracker. Not
           only are

AFC JohnC  Mike...SoundConvert...released?

AFL JoyceM Great, Mike.  When can we get SoundConvert, Mike? and FutureSound
           :)

AFA Gene   there a couple of bugs with memory management, but if you're
           loading in a MOD file that's really big, NT will eat your RAMdisk.

AFC Eddie  Sounds good.

Nuzz       The manual is being ""layout"". Release date should be about 1st
           week of Dec

ELECTMUSIC Tnxs Gene

AFC JohnC  YES.......WTG Nuzz!!!!!!!!

Deanna7332 Yes, why is there on some MOD files a stop somewhere in the middle
           ?

Deanna7332 That's really frustrating!

AFL JoyceM Mike, leave me E-Mail on when and how I can send your the $$ to
           get it.

AFL JoyceM Again...night all

Nuzz       gee John, I had to do something to explain the delay :)

ELECTMUSIC Thanks Gene for a GREAT chat!

AFC Eddie  Yes, Gene!  Great!

AFA Gene   Thanks Greg, 'night!

AFA Gene   thanx, see y'all later :)

Copyright 1987 Bob Szekely.

    John Michael Osbourne, (known as ""Ozzy"" to his fans), has in his long 
career as vocalist for Black Sabbath had his work with the group misconstrued 
as advocating Satanism.  In a 1983 radio special featuring Ozzy, the 
interviewer expressed precisely this point; ""...Ozzy has always been shrouded 
in the darkest of Satanic imagery.  Yet if you really listen to his music, 
you'll find that what he is saying differs greatly from his image....""(1)  Even 
the group's image has often been described as ""occult and diabolic"".(2)

    The important point to remember here is to differentiate between appearance 
and reality.  Although the name ""Black Sabbath"" conjures up images of witches 
and sorcerers paying homage to Satan for the powers bestowed upon them, this 
does not make it safe to assume that the group that went by this name 
necessarily drew the inspiration from the occult.(3)  The closest they ever 
came to it was a gothic horror film featuring Boris Karloff as narrator; they 
adopted their name directly from the name of this film.(4)  Black Sabbath was 
involved in the black arts as much as Karloff practiced casting spells off-
screen.  Tony Iommi, the group's guitarist, summed it up best when he described 
the group as having basically ""...the same appeal as a horror movie.  It's all 
an act.""(5)










    Just as their film counterpart did, Ozzy and Sabbath found the occult 
mythos to be an effective vehicle for powerful social commentary; particularly 
when put in the context of heavy-metal rock and roll.  Ozzy himself noted that 
there are ""...people who pick up my [album] cover[s] and go...'This guy's got 
to be singing about Devil, doom, death and destruction.'  Which is not the 
case....""(6)

    The late Lester Bangs likened the group to Bob Dylan and William Burroughs, 
describing them all as ""...moralists...trying to deal with a serious present 
situation in an honest way....""(7)  Ozzy and Black Sabbath merely bring to 
light the many evils of our world in their work, to try and make us realize 
that we are all victim to their influence.  They hope to make us recognize 
these evils so that we may take up arms against them; a point Ozzy emphatically 
stresses:  ""...one thing everybody has got to understand about Black Sabbath's 
lyrics.  They're not downer lyrics, they're just telling everybody where it's 
at...""(8)  He also cites the group's most controversial tune, ""Black Sabbath"", 
as a response to the ignorant hippie culture still force when the tune was 
written in 1970:  ""The hippies said: 'The world is beautiful man.' (sic)  You 
only had to look around you to see how crappy it was.  It was ridiculous 
listening to that stuff, let alone playing it, so we just wrote about the world 
the way it really was and how it affected us - and we felt better in ourselves 
because we were really being honest....""(9)

    I   1   HAVE YOU EVER THOUGH ABOUT YOUR SOUL-
        2   CAN IT BE SAVED?
        3   OR PERHAPS YOU THINK THAT WHEN YOU ARE DEAD
        4   YOU JUST STAY IN YOUR GRAVE.
        5   IS GOD JUST A THOUGHT WITHIN YOUR HEAD OR IS
        6   HE A PART OF YOU?
        7   IS CHRIST JUST A NAME THAT YOU READ IN A BOOK
        8   WHEN YOU WERE AT SCHOOL?

    II  9   WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT DEATH DO YOU LOSE
        10  YOUR BREATH OR DO YOU KEEP YOUR COOL?
        11  WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE THE POPE ON THE END
        12  OF A ROPE - DO YOU THINK HE'S A FOOL?
        13  WELL I'VE SEEN THE TRUTH - YES I'VE SEEN 
        14  THE LIGHT AND I'VE CHANGED MY WAYS.
        15  AND I'LL BE PREPARED WHEN YOU'RE LONELY 
        16  AND SCARED AT THE END OF OUR DAYS.

    III 17  COULD IT BE YOU'RE AFRAID OF WHAT YOU'R
        18  FRIENDS MIGHT SAY 
        19  IF THEY NEW YOU BELIEVED IN GOD ABOVE
        20  THEY SHOULD REALISE BEFORE THE CRITICISE
        21  THAT GOD IS THE ONLY WAY TO LOVE.

    IV  23  IS YOUR MIND SO SMALL THAT YOU HAVE TO FALL
        24 IN WITH THE PACK WHEREVER THEY RUN
        25  WILL YOU STILL SNEER WHEN DEATH IS NEAR
        26  AND SAY THEY MAY AS WELL WORSHIP THE SUN.

    V   27  I THINK IT WAS TRUE IT WAS PEOPLE LIKE YOU
        28  THAT CRUCIFIED CHRIST
        29  I THINK IT IS SAD THE OPINION YOU HADE WAS THE
        30  ONLY ONE VOICED.
        31  WILL YOU BE SO SURE WHEN YOUR DAY IS NEAR
        32  SAY YOU DON'T BELIEVE?
        33  YOU HAD THE CHANCE BUT YOU TURNED IT DOWN
        34  NOW YOU CAN'T RETRIEVE.










    VI  35  PERHAPS YOU'LL THINK BEFORE YOU SAY THAT
        36  GOD IS DEAD AND GONE
        37  OPEN YOUR EYES, JUST REALIZE THAT HE IS THE
        38  ONE.
        39  THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN SAVE YOU KNOW FROM
        40  ALL THIS SIN AND HATE.
        41  OR WILL YOU STILL JEER AT ALL YOU HEAR?
        42  YES!-I THINK IT'S TOO LATE.

    In this piece, the group asserts a belief in an afterlife and spiritual 
redemption.  As grisly as the image of a hanged pontiff is, its shock value is 
a necessary part of the message:  They reject religious dogma, stating that a 
belief in God, in one's own heart, is the only guiding light to help one inn 
his life (lines 11/12, 39/40).  Furthermore, the reject religious hypocrisy 
(lines 5/6, 7/8) and peer pressure (verses III, IV) as excuses for not 
accepting God.  To clarify further:  following the crowd does not justify 
shrugging responsibility for one's own actions.

    After re-reading, it becomes obvious that this song is an ascerbic critique 
of atheism; (line 35/36) I refer here again to verses three and four.  In these 
two verses, the picture painted in one of Godless conformity and how it's 
viewed as being as foolish as Paganism.  These lyrics set an example for the 
listener by relating personal experience (lines 13-16).  However, for those who 
cannot accept this the group has no recourse but to condemn them, although 
rather ironically; they hope that their rhetorical loss of faith in the 
listener will open his eyes (line 42).










                           B L A C K   S A B B A T H 



            WHAT IS THIS, THAT STANDS BEFORE ME?
            FIGURE IN BLACK, WHICH POINTS AT ME
            TURN ROUND QUICK AND START TO RUN
            FIND OUT I'M THE CHOSEN ONE.  OH, NO!
            
            BIG BLACK SHAPE WITH EYES OF FIRE
            TELLING PEOPLE THEIR DESIRE
            SATAN'S SITTING THERE, HE'S SMILING
            WATCHES THOSE FLAMES GET HIGHER AND HIGHER
            OH, NO, NO, -- PLEASE GOD HELP ME!
            
                IS THIS THE END MY FRIEND?
                SATAN'S COMING 'ROUND THE BEND
                PEOPLE RUNNING 'CAUSE THEY'RE SCARED
                THE PEOPLE BETTER GO AND BEWARE
                NO, NO!  PLEASE--NO!!
                
                
    The all time controversy winner!  Is this not irrefutably  THE song about 
Black Magic in rock?  It's all so obvious, suffuse with evil imagery; Satan, 
walls of flame, figure in black, and damnation at the end.  Yes, I see the 
images too; it definitely concerns Black Magic.  Then again, Shakespeare's 
Macbeth employed scenes of witches involved in conjurations; does that mean 
that Shakespeare was a warlock?  Poe used to write sardonic tragedies about 
twisted murderers and the bizarre nature of acts, did that make him an evil, 
leering, demented killer?  Did either of them advocated what they wrote about?  
One has to remember that writing about something is not necessarily the same as 
emulating it.  Tony Iommi spoke out quite strongly about this:  ""People are 
bringing us down saying that we are a Black Magic group.  I think they must be










getting mixed up with Black Widow.  We don't do any sacrifices on stage, and 
we're not on a black magic kick.  We wanted to do heavy numbers and the guitar 
riffs we worked out were more suited to evil things than love.  We play songs 
about black magic, but they are more likely to be against than for it.""(12)  

    By now, you're probably asking yourself who Black Widow is, right?  Then 
it's time for a little history:

        Sabbath, before they were known as Sabbath, had the same line-up but 
two earlier names.  The first one was Polka Tulk, which seemed sure to doom 
them to obscurity.(13)  The soon realized this and changed the group's name to 
Earth.  Now, Earth was a blues band at the end of the English blues boom.  As 
if that wasn't bad enough, they soon discovered that not only was there another 
group named Earth, but they had also released a single.  To avoid confusion, 
they changed their name again.(14)  But what made them decide on that name?  
Just ask Ozzy:  ""I just liked the name Black Sabbath because of the succession 
of vowel sounds.(15)  If that sounds ludicrous just consider this:  Sabbath was 
""...the first of the really committed, loud and heavy bands...""(16)  They 
needed a name to match the gut-wrenching power they were developing.  Tony knew 
that he wanted Sabbath to be noticed above all the rest of the British blues 
bands:  ""We wanted something of our own that we'd like and people would like.  
And we wanted something loud!""










    Tony didn't hate the blues.  He'd cut his teeth as a guitarist on the likes 
of The Shadows, Buddy Holly and Django Rheinhardt, developing his own style 
from there.  But he realized the group had no future in the blues:

        'We couldn't keep playing 12-bars forever.  We just got fed up with 
Earth music.  It was jazz, blues stuff.  It was good for practice but nothing 
else.'

    In the late 'Sixties, blues groups were a dime a dozen in Birmingham and 
interest was waning in the blues boom due to the glut of groups.  One man, by 
the name of Jim Simpson, had heard Earth around the Birmingham club circuit and 
understood what they were trying to do.  He decided to take them under his 
wing.  With the aid of his massive record collection, Jim expanded the group's 
horizons in the areas of jazz and blues.  He introduced them to artists like 
Wes Montgomery, Count Basie and Jimmy Rushing.  It was from Rushing in 
particular that they derived the repetitive riff style so readily noticeable in 
their later incarnation as Black Sabbath.

    The Count Basie influence is evidenced in the song ""Wicked World"" from the 
first album; Sabbath drummer Bill Ward uses a ""'sighing hi-hat'...in the manner 
of Basie's drummer Jo Jones.""










    The influence is subtle, almost subliminal.  Yet it is one which was not 
thought capable of hard, 'heavy' rock bands in the late 'Sixties.  Although Led 
Zeppelin and Jimi Hendrix also had their work steeped in blues and jazz 
derivations (Hendrix' ""Third Stone From the Sun"" and Zeppelin's version of 
Willie Dixon's ""I Can't Quit You Baby"" from their first album), neither was 
able to match the intense energy of Black Sabbath.  Iommi has always had a 
preference for music with an original, distinct style of its' own; as an 
example, he mentions guitarists Joe Pass and Alvin Lee as two of his strongest 
songwriting influences.

    It would also be necessary that Sabbath develop a unique, distinctive style 
and image of their own.  Though they had changed their name from Earth to Black 
Sabbath to avoid confusion with the other Earth; at the same time another group 
emerged by the name of Black Widow ""...who WERE profoundly influenced by the 
occult, had a male witch as a patron, and wrote pieces like ""Come to The 
Sabbat.""  Unfortunately, Sabbath was constantly reaping the benefits of Widow's 
publicity.

    Sabbath was a group that never minced words.  If they saw something as 
destructive, they would be sure to rub the listener's face it it.  They did not 
want their point to be missed.

    With their straightforward, sometimes brutal way of looking at things, they 
try to shock the listener's conscience back into awareness.  The imagery of 
""Hand of Doom"", from the Paranoid album, is candid and condemning; it is a 
strong statement against drug addiction and rightly so...

            CAUSED BY DEADLY PIN
            
            HEAD STARTS SPINNING 'ROUND
            FALL DOWN TO THE GROUND
            FEEL YOUR BODY HEAVE
            DEATH'S HANDS START TO WEAVE
            
            IT'S TO LATE TOO TURN
            YOU DON'T WANNA LEARN
            PRICE OF LIFE YOU CRY
            NOW YOU'RE GONNA DIE
            
            
    Many people felt the group's overall direction was pessimistic and had a 
negative effect on its listener's due to that.  ""Ozzy insisted that if people 
thought he was having a bad effect on the minds of young kids, they should go 
and watch the TV news where real murder and mayhem were a way of life, and 
shown night after night."" (18)

    Sabbath was never negative in their message; they were simply truthful 
about waht they saw as wrong in the world.  If you ""Strip away the horror 
stories, the imagery and the hysteria, (and) turn down the amps a notch...you 
have a well-rehearsed, solid blues and rock band, powered by a dedication to 
well defined objectives.""  On the top of the list of those objectives was 
truth; Sabbath never feared facing that truth squarely, regardless of what many 
people thought of them.

Long, long, time ago,
I can still remember,
When the local calls were ""free"".
And I knew if I paid my bill,
And never wished them any ill,
That the phone company would let me be...

But Uncle Sam said he knew better,
Split 'em up, for all and ever!
We'll foster competition:
It's good capital-ism!

I can't remember if I cried,
When my phone bill first tripled in size.
But something touched me deep inside,
The day... Bell System... died.

And we were singing...

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

Is your office Step by Step,
Or have you gotten some Crossbar yet?
Everybody used to ask...
Oh, is TSPS coming soon?
IDDD will be a boon!
And, I hope to get a Touch-Tone phone, real soon...

The color phones are really neat,
And direct dialing can't be beat!
My area code is ""low"":
The prestige way to go!

Oh, they just raised phone booths to a dime!
Well, I suppose it's about time.
I remember how the payphones chimed,
The day... Bell System... died.

And we were singing...

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

Back then we were all at one rate,
Phone installs didn't cause debate,
About who'd put which wire where...
Installers came right out to you,
No ""phone stores"" with their ballyhoo,
And 411 was free, seemed very fair!

But FCC wanted it seems,
To let others skim long-distance creams,
No matter 'bout the locals,
They're mostly all just yokels!

And so one day it came to pass,
That the great Bell System did collapse,
In rubble now, we all do mass,
The day... Bell System... died.

So bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

I drove on out to Murray Hill,
To see Bell Labs, some time to kill,
But the sign there said the Labs were gone.
I went back to my old CO,
Where I'd had my phone lines, years ago,
But it was empty, dark, and ever so forlorn...

No relays pulsed,
No data crooned,
No MF tones did play their tunes,
There wasn't a word spoken,
All carrier paths were broken...

And so that's how it all occurred,
Microwave horns just nests for birds,
Everything became so absurd,
The day... Bell System... died.

So bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

We were singing:

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?

on that Resurrection Day!             where he'll hit you with a pie!

I hear Valkyries a-comin                There are people into Voodoo
In the air their song is comin          there are people into Voodoo
They forgot the words! They're hummin!  I know I do, I hope you do!
But they're good enough for me!         and it's good enough for me!

We will venerate Bubastis             We will read from the Kabahlah

We will all bow down to Enlil       There are some who practice Shinto
We will all bow down to Enlil       there are some who practice Shinto

With bold Gilgamesh the Brave!      but that's good enough for me!

We will all see Aphrodite               We will all sing Hare Krishna
Though she's pretty wild and flighty    We will all sing Hare Krishna
She will meet us in her nightie         It's not mentioned in the Mishna
And she's good enough for me!           But it's good enough for me!

It was good enough for Loki         We will all go to Nirvana

He thinks Thor's a little hokey     Make a left turn at Urbana

Here's to those who copy Conan    There will be a lot of lovin
Here's to those who copy Conan    when we're meetin in our Coven
They're just Followers of Onan    Quit yer pushin and yer shovin
and that's good enough for me!    So there's room enough for me!

We will have a mighty Party           It was good enough for Sappho
In the honor of Astarte               With her lady on her lap-o
Grab your chiton - don't be tardy     She put Lesbos on the map-o
'Cause she's good enough for me!      With her pagan poetry!

Shall we sing a verse for Venus,    Well the Christians all are humming
Of the Gods she is the meanest,     Cause they say their God is coming,
Cause she bit me on my...elbow      Our God came three times this evening
And it's good enough for me.        And that's good enough for me.

We will worship like the Druids,      Some guys have a circumcision
Drinking strange fermented fluids,    On account of their religion,
Running naked through the woo-ids,    An embarrassing incision
Coz that's good enough for me.        Cut just ENOUGH from me!   

We will sing a verse for Loki       It was good for old Jehovah
He's the old Norse god of Chaos     He had a son who was a nova!
Which is why this verse don't       Hey there, Mithras! Move on ova'!
       rhyme or scan or nothin'     Another resurrection Day!
But it's good enough for me...

It was good for Thor and Odin       It could be that you're a Parsi

There are those who, when they've got e-
Normous problems that are knotty
They just take them to Hecate         Thanks to great Quetzacoatl

And that's good enough for me!        But that's good enough for me!

Let us sing the praise of Horus    We went off to worship Venus
As our fathers did before us       By the Gods! You should have seen us!
We're the New Egyptian Chorus      Now the Clinic has to screen us...
And we sing in harmony!            But that's good enough for me!

Hare Krishna gets a laugh on         I'll arise at early mornin'

Well, that's good enough for me!     To know that's right for me!

Lilith wears a lacy nightie        That Bob Larson shrieks and hollers

She's wet-dream enough for me!     And that's good enough for me.

And that's good enough for me.       So he's good enough for me.

We will sing of Iluvatur,             We will sing of Foul the Render,
Who sent the Valar 'cross the water   Who's got Drool Rockworm on a bender
To lead Morgoth to the slaughter      In his cave in Kiril Threndor--
And that's just fine with me.         They're both too much for me.

   She needs a swig of Imperium Compound
   Then perhaps she'd deign to talk to me!            

   Lady Trude thought it her duty
   To turn a social wrong into a Right
   Proved her point with Imperium Compound
   And showed that Cheshire Cats can fight!  //and scratch//

   The Board of Directors styled themselves The Electors
   And another con they tried to swing
   Now the BoD drinks Imperium Compound
   So we no longer need a King!                        

   AltChorus: Oh the Bod, the BoD, the BoD,
              It thinks it is God, is God, is God,
              The figure of Supreme Authority!
              And if we O.D.'d on Imperium Compund
              there'd be no need for Royalty!          

   Oh, MEDIEVAL Net, we thought it was all wet
   With witty remarks, and other kinds of sass
   We'll feed our computers on Imperium Compound
   And BYTE the BoD right on its' righteous ass!         

   Good old Duncan was often drunken
   Chasing all the ladies fair
   He bathed himself in Imperium Compound
   Now he has a little savoir faire!

  ATEN IMPERIUM (cont.)

   Ioseph of Locksley, never changes his socks, he
   Runs around looking like a Cavalier,
   He stocked up on Imperium Compound
   And he has enough to last for years and years!        

   AltChorus: Oh they forgot, forgot, forgot
              The Locks-e-ly Plot, the Plot, the Plot!
              And it works the best when it is underground!
              It isn't a hassle for a green-and-white tassle
              They're the ones that BREW Imperium Compound!  

   Trelon of the Wood, he was very good, he
   Was a leader that had never been beat before;
   But Caid had Imperium Compound,
   And Imperial Roman Caid won the War!  //with help!//   

   In Tyr Ysgithr, it's regularly whispered there
   That the Kingdom is ruled over by a King    // What's THAT? //
   They're ""democratic"" and quite erratic....
   They've forgot the purpose of the whole damn thing!     

   King Sir Mark von, with his pretty white suit on,
   Rules the Kingdom both with Grace and Purity!
   He never touches Imperium Compound
   At least not where anyone else can see!               

   Duke Sir Deaton, was never beaten
   On the field, or in the drinking hall;
   At the Catbox War with Caid,
   Left thirty bodies piled against the wall!             

   Denis O'Titans was good at smitin'
   A Locksley Monster in every single way!
   Drank a little Imperium Compound
   And ATE Deaton's sword that day  // No! REALLY! //       

   Wotan the Mongoloid, a little bit paranoid,
   But a nice guy none the less;
   Drank a mess of Imperium Compound
   Now he's Justin du Roc, I confess!                       

   Then there's Duke Reynard, with a face like a St. Bernard
   Of the Dukes, he is the homliest
   He tends to toke up on Imperium Compound
   And go out and whomp on anybody's best!                   

   This song'll bedevil the folks at a revel,
   And most of the time it will annoy the King,
   So take a drink of Imperium Compound
   And let's go Royalty-bedeviling!                        

   Duchess Anna is quite a fan-a
   Going on a wartime shopping spree!  \\ War Point!\\
   Took a drink of Imperium Compound
   And shopped so fast we couldn't see! \\ Z-o-o-o-om!\\    (5)

  ATEN IMPERIUM (Cont.)

   Lyn of Whitewolfe, made of the right stuff,
   Twice the Queen of Atenveldt;
   Took a drink of Imperium Compound
   And the Kingdom of Caid before her knelt!              

   Duke Sir Brion, and Duke Sir Trelon,
   Won the Crown with regularity;
   Drank a lot of Imperium Compound,
   And founded a dynasty!                                 

   Stephan von Geist, was most awful nice,
   And a chivalrous fighter without any doubt
   Took a swig of Imperium Compound
   And won the Crown his first time out!                    

   All the Crusadenes were big, but not mean,
   And the finest fighters in the town.
   But they all drank Jerusalem Compound,
   Winning Crown after Crown after Crown!                 

   Good Duke Arthur couldn't get no farth-er
   A Norman King in Aten Land
   Drank too much of Imperium Compound
   And went off to conquer Engel-land!                    

   Then King Richard, a bit of a bitch, heard
   A King's Crown could be done.
   Drank a little Imperium Compound
   And became the Aten King, first one!                    

   Duchess Malinda, who doesn't do windas,
   But she does a lot of Duchess Things,
   But give her a LOT of Imperium Compound,
   And she sings and sings and sings and sings and sings!   

   Duke Sir Brion, with his pretty white suit on,
   Is a model of goodness and purity
   Never touches Imperium Compound
(spoken:) And I'll sell ya seashore property in Yuma, too!  

   Optional last verse:

   Many tales abound of Imperium Compound
   And its' strange effects on Royalty,
   But after an hour, this song has no power,
   And by now, it's boring ME!                            

   AltChorus: Oh it's too long, too long, too long
              To sing the whole song, the song, the song
              Longer than a Royal Court, it is!
              But sing it serial, this ditty Imperial
              And you'll be a bardic whiz!

        Last night I had the strangest dream in this bleak century
        I dreamed that people the world around believed in Chivalry

        I dreamed I saw a Kingly Crown enshrined in laurel leaves
        with Grace and Joy and Purity attendant at his feet

        I dreamed I saw the perfect Knight receive his accolade
        and minstrels sang and children laughed in some soft forest glade

        I dreamed I saw the finest thing that ever man could make
        grow great and strong and undefiled: Pray God I never wake!

        Last night I had the strangest dream in this bleak century
        I dreamed that people the world around believed in Chivalry

               (to the tune of ""Good King Wenceslaus"")

                Locksley Monsters never yield
                on the field of battle
                strike the helm and bash the shield
                make their eyeteeth rattle
                Bodies on the ground will lie
                bones will burst in sunder
                search for Locksleys' enemies:
                You'll find them six feet under!

                              SONG OF IVANOF

            There is a man who we know well that does the best he can
            but he's displayed in armour made of reticulated garbage cans!

            He looks so fine and fair and strong, oh how he plays the man
            and how it's prized, those galvanized, reticulated garbage cans

            The noblest Roman of them all, a good Praetorian
            a combatant who wears no pants, judst reticulated garbage cans!

            Like old Horatius at the Bridge, like the Legions of Valerian
            (O dearie me: those LOVELY knees!)
            and those reticulated garbage cans!

                         C. McCray Bethancourt

         (sung to the tune (obviously) of the 12 Days of Christmas)


1.           The first time I sent my device, The Heralds said to me

            ""It violates the Rule of Three""

2.           The next time I tried it, the Heralds said to me

            ""We changed the forms, and it violates the Rule of
             Three"".

3.           The third time I tried, and the Heralds said to me, 

            ""We upped the fees, we changed the forms, and it
             violates the Rule of Three"".

4.           Another time I tried and the Heralds said to me,
 
            ""We haven't got it, we upped the fees, we changed the 
             forms, and it violates the Rule of Three"".

5.           The fifth time I tried it, the Heralds said to me,  

            ""In a decision rendered by the College of Arms on
             August 1st, A.S. V it was decided that this style of
             heraldic design was not appropriate to the aims and 
             intentions of the Corporate Body. Holy! Holy! Holy! ""

 note: verse 5 is delivered in an extremely fast, mono-
       tone, similiar to a Gregorian Chant.

           "" ....we haven't got it, we upped the fees, we changed the forms,
             and it violates the Rule of Three.""

6.           I tried it a sixth time, and the Heralds said to me,

            ""We changed the rules, &c""

7.           A seventh time I tried and, the Heralds said to me,

            ""It's against the Rule of Tincture, we changed the
             rules, &c""

8.           I tried it once again and the heralds said to me,

            ""It's not a Period design, It's against the Rule of Tincture, We
             changed the rules, &c""

                                * more *



    Heralds Said To Me (cont.)

9.           I sent it in once more, and the Heralds said to me,

            ""We changed the rules again, It's not a Period design,
             it's against the Rule of Tincture, we changed the
             rules, &c""

10. (sung in cold anger)
             The LAST time I sent my device, the Heralds said to me

    (sung in a state of SMUG)
             ""Someone else has got it, &c""




              (nb: every single one of these reasons has been used by the
              CoA, at one point or another, to reject perfectly good
              heraldry, along with some even MORE stupid.  If the shoe 
              fits....................!!!!!!!!)

           or: Who was that Vermin I saw you with last, Knight?
   or: There may be Lice on all you Knice, but there ain't no Lice on me

           Once there was a Barony howling in the wilderness
           nestled in the Valley where the River doesn't flow
           and the folks were driven buggy by the insects in the Revel Hall
           Authenticity is wonderful, but this doesn't go!

                   Bugs on the Baroness, bugs on the Baroness!
                   That was the cry that you heard all the day
                   and the scratching can be heard from Ysgithr to Ered Sul
                   why did we come here? Let's go away!

           See them all a scratching, nestled in their armour tight
           the fleas have a melee team that's challenging the field!
           call Truly Nolen! Someone's gotta help us out!
           the crabs are nesting in our helms but we'll never yield!

                   (chorus)

           Dawn comes a-breaking, the bugs have won the Coronet...
           flea-infested Conan-clones in piles upon the lawn
           where is the Barony? The bugs have eaten everyone...
           termites got the stick-jocks, and all their sticks are gone!

                  For all the Lands where I have dwelt
                  Oh Atenveldt, Oh Atenveldt
                  till rivers burn and mountains melt
                  lest I forget my Atenveldt
                  From deserts stark to snow-capped peaks
                  from silent lakes and laughing creeks
                  sing: Oh let man find his heart's ease
                  on rocky plains
                  in desert breeze

                  For oft I thought of mighty men
                  who carved a Land with sword and pen
                  and lit a candle, burning bright,
                  that pierced the darkness; stirred the night!
                  tho some are gone their deeds remain
                  this sunny Crown without a stain
                  sing: Oh, their deeds were not in vain!
                  in sunlit days
                  and falling rain.....

                  So raise your banners, blazoned bright
                  Advance the Dream and Shine the Light!
                  in battle's crash and Revel's song
                  raise high the Flag and wave it long!
                  For all the Lands wherein I've dwelt
                  I love you best, my Atenveldt!
                  Sing: Oh the Joy that I have felt!

      What the use of wearing panties
      whalebone corsets of your Auntie's
      boxer shorts and other scanties
      best of all is nude
      there's such fun in going bra-less
      now that it's no longer lawless
      'specially if your figure's flawless
      best of all is nude
      nude is what you're born in
      shirts are never torn in
      underwear and lacy flimsies, garter belts and other whimsies
      yards of itchy cloth to put your form in
      ducks all do it, maidens rue it
      even ancient Picts in Britain blue it
      going naked's how to do it
      best of all is nude!

      If your garters aren't elastic
      tie them up in knots fantastic
      (panty hose is something drastic!)
      best of all is nude!
      If you're tired of wearing clotheses
      shed your garment 'mongst the roses
      never mind the old bluenoses
      best of all is nude!
      Nude is best for ducking!
      Worst for horses bucking!
      Moonlit nights will see such sights
          that are very best for fooling round
                              .....and elbows!
      Nudity is grand to see
       a well-known antidote to virginity
      take your clothes off and you'll see:
      best of all is nude!

                                  came the Lady to the lea
                                  Sword and Roses in Her Hand
                                  spread their seeds thruout the Land

                                  Came the Stag from oaken wood
                                  saw the Lady where she stood
                                  by the fire burning bright
                                  came to know his heart's delight!

                   (end of extra verses)

                   By Sword and Harp, and Irish Hound
                   Blessed Be: the Day I've found
                   Hail to the Lady, one in Three
                   Present is Past and Past is WE

                   By Oak and Ash and Holy Thorn
                   bledded be the Day you're born!
                   Fire burn and fire bright

               I'll tell you a tale of Peace and Love

               Of those that Rule all Lands above

               they gently raised us from the slime
               and kept our hands from Hellishe Crime
               and made us a Kingdom in their own good time

               Now, Atenveldt forgets the Past
               and thinks on a Day that's coming fast
               when we shall all be....civilized....(puke)

                    WEAPONS AT THE DOOR

 Being a Polemic concerning the alleged Custom of the West Kingdom concerning 
 checking your Weapons at the Door of the Revel Hall. As the Satire is the 
 Weapon of the Bard, this said Polemic is to be checked at the Door, along with 
 swords, knives, redheaded Ladies and other such Deadly Things.....

         As I roved out to Western Lands to take the Western Air
         I went into a Revel Hall and I saw a Twelfth Night there
         but I was halted at the gate by a Privy Consellor
                 (that's the man who tells the King of the West how to go to
                  the bath room!)
         who told me I would have to check my Weapons at the door

         As I, in my astonishment, stood hung on tenter-pegs
         a Knight came in whose Prouess hung down between his legs
         the Doorman grabbed a greatsword and he struck the Knight full sore
         and gave him a reciept; he left his weapon at the door!

         a Bard was next whose goodly Voice has entertained us all
         but he, too, was prevented from entering the Hall
         and told he could not carry deadly weapons on the floor
         he left his Voice and Harp among the weapons at the door

         a Master entered graciously, a man we all know well
         who holds a 3rd Dan Black Belt, tho this he'd never tell
         the Master struggled valiantly, the Master cursed and swore
         but he left his hands, and feet, as weapons at the door

         the company was jovial, altho a bit dismayed
         for lack of proper cutlery, down to the smallest blade
         for even teeth and fingernails, each can be used in War
         were cut, and pulled, and left behind, as weapons at the door!

         And has their King not loyal Knights that He must be afraid
         of brawling in his Hall and of Assassin's bloody blade?
         the Rights of Men to carry Arms at least WE'VE not foreswore
         and a POX on them that made the Rule of Weapons at the Door!

                           THE STREETS OF ANN ARBOR

               As I walked out thru the streets of Ann Arbor
               as I walked out thru Ann Arbor one day
               I spied a young Mongol all dressed in white linen
               all dressed in white linen and cold as the clay

               I then spied another, done in on the sidewalk
               along with just about six dozen more
               their wounds were all gaping, from mace and from braoadsword
               from claymore and cannon, all dripping with gore

               what caused this grave carnage, I cried to the Monglos
               oh pray what's the reason for this awful sight
               my answer came slowly from under the corpse-pile
               ""It seems that our bark is much worse than our bite.....""

               the answer continued from pale lips a-shaking
               we sang all our songs and believed them as true
               the Dark Horde could never be beaten in battle
               we thought this was what all good Mongols could do...

               we went down to Atenveldt all for to plunder
               ""too large to defend"" was our song every night
               but Atenveldt's different from East, West or Middle
               there, even the bushes have learned how to bite!

               the Clann stole our ponies, the Scraelings our foodstuffs
               we ran into axes in AtenViking hands
               our maidens ran off with one Richard of Arkham
               and we're all that's left to return to our lands

               MacChluarains and Monsters, Lockehaven and Foxmoor
               that Kingdom is BIG and its' fighters are MEAN!
               we fought and we lost, and fled back to Ann Arbor
               we all came back home with results that you've seen

               keep away from that Land with its' cactus and marshes
               it's no place for Mongols who are bent on War
               they count their blows well, but they strick them yet better
               he crawled into his Yurt, and fell, dead, on the floor.....

       tune: the song of the Cowardly Lion, Tin Woodsman and Scarecrow
             in the movie version of the Wizard of Oz

        (Enter the Scarecrow, who singeth:)

        My wife is always nagging; my Prowess it is lagging
        I can't do anything
        she has got a reason, but revenge is out of season
        Oh I wish I could be King!

        If I just had the Crown on, I'd always have a frown on
        and the Barons on a string
        Heads they would be rolling, the Board would be cajoling
        Oh if only I was King!

        I am very fed up with the way this group is set up
        Oh I'd change everything!
        they are so high and mighty with the way that they do fight-ey
        Oh, someday I'll be King!

        Tho my wife is melancholic, and very...vitriolic
        she's a wasp without a sting!
        I'd have to supervise her with a pack of tranquilizers
        If I only was a King......

        (the Tin Woodsman joineth him, and singeth:)

        I grew up kind of cocky, and rather big, and stocky
        and straight as any rod
        on the field I'm a battallion, with the Ladies I'm a stallion
        ...Oh they'd better make me God!

        The other boys are jealous they say I'm over-zealous
        they'd do better to applaud
        the things that I am giving to this Dream that we are living
        oh I wish they'd make me God!

        They say that I'm conceited, but I'm just badly treated
        by people and by BoD
        just think of what they're missing by My Majesty dismissing
        Oh they'd better make me God!

        (the Cowardly Lion creepeth forth, and singeth:)

        Oh I could be a fighter, a great and mighty smiter
        and be the perfect knight
        it's a great and nasty shame, and everyone's to blame
        oh I wish that I could fight!

        Song of the Three (cont.)

        I could be a Cavalier drinking wine and ale and beer
        and be a gorgeous sight
        but it would cost me too much money so it isn't very funny
        oh I wish that I could fight!                               

        Let me at 'em on the field, I would surely make them yield
        to my Power and my Might
        with rattan, shinai and rapier they would nevermore escape here
        If they'd only let me fight

                She was afraid to come out to the Tourney
                She was worried that ""something might show..""
                She was afraid to come out to the Tourney
                And the poor thing did NOT want to go...

                  (2 - 3 - 4, tell the people what she wore!)

                  It was an itsy bitsy teeny weenie little rabbit fur bikini
                  That she wore, for the first time, that day.
                  An itsy bitsy teenie weenie little rabbit fur bikini
                  And in her apartment she wanted to stay!

                One day in the Kingdom of the Middle
                It happened at a Tourney one day:
                The Mongols invaded the Middle
                But the Middle did not want to play...

                  (eins - zwei - drei, but the Dark Horde wouldn't die!)

                  It was an itsy bitsy tiny teenie Nauseating Mongol weenie
                  That they saw, for the first time, that day.
                  An itsy bitsy tiny teenie Nauseating Mongol weenie
                  And the Mongols did NOT go away!

                Now the Heralds made up a new Rulebook
                And to read it is some kind of gas!
                It's a bureaucrat's dream, this new Rulebook
                Now NOBODY'S blazon can pass!

                  (Win - Place - Show, tell the Heralds where to go!)

                                 (insert Bronx cheer!)

                  I want an itsy bitsy teenie weenie little rabbit fur bikini
                  On my shield, as my blazon, today!
                  An itsy bitsy teenie weenie little rabbit fur bikini
                  But ""that's offensive"" the Heralds all say!

                I sat down at the Revel last evening
                To a feast of green meat, and Rat Pie...
                It was cold, and disgusting, and greasy
                And I just want to upchuck and die!

                  (6 - 7 - 8, tell them what was on your plate!)

                  It was an itsy bitsy teenie weenie little rabbit fur bikini
                  With a side dish of cold cabbage pie!
                  An itsy bitsy teenie weenie little rabbit fur bikini

          Some folks call me many names, others call me crazy
          Tom O'Bedlam's son am I, for my mind is hazy!
          I'd rather sing a song than work (if it's not too phrasey!)
          Lengthy rhymes don't bother me....truth to tell: I'm lazy!

          Yang, your yurt is very nice, and your Horde is smelly,
          And I'm sure that yak-meat will nicely fill one's belly!
          But remember this one line, or you're not worth jelly:
          FIRST you plunder, THEN you burn! That's how to be rakehelly!

          My Lady Lorelei your eyes do drive me to distraction
          And the lovely Care-Cheri causes....petrifaction!
          But I, and they, quite taken are, so I can't take action...
          Therefore, Ladies, fill my cup; I'll drink to stupefaction!

          Now Atenveldt your fighters, all, are most good and gentle
          And the Ladies, bless 'em all, are most ornamental!
          But that little Nikki-Toad....has me sentimental
          Though with boffer in her hand she is argumental!

          This stupid little song, m'lords, is mostly sung in Latin
          By the Goliards, of course, from vespers clear to matins!
          But I prefer a coarser cloth over silk or satins
          English is more understood, mine enemies to flatten!

          Good People all, I've made my Song, its' music's well-recited

          It's rude and rusty, grim and bad, and squeaky like a door-hinge,
          But I'm a better Bard than you: I found a rhyme for ""orange!""

                      by William Poundstone
                              1983

     Two mentalities are at work here: 1960s rock fans and 1980s
fundamentalist Christians. The idea of phonographically concealed
messages dates from the Paul McCartney death scare of 1969. For
hard-core types, the secret-message rumors never really died. Avid
rock fans have auditioned ever album release since the late 1960s
for hidden nuances. Backward messages, barely audible messages,
and messages on one stereo track only have been alleged. At the
other end of the sociosensual spectrum, fundamentalist Christians
have gotten into the act. TV programs such as PRAISE THE LORD and
THE 700 CLUB have propagated rumors of a satanic plot in the
recording industry, no less, in which various albums conceal
""backward-masked"" demonic murmurings. If THAT sounds too spacey to
be taken seriously, consider that it was the fundamentalist groups
who were behind House Resolution 6363, a bill introduced in the
U.S. House of Representatives by Robert K. Dornan (R., Calif.) in
1982 to label all suspect records: ""WARNING: THIS RECORD CONTAINS
BACKWARD MASKING THAT MAKES A VERBAL STATEMENT WHICH IS AUDIBLE
WHEN THIS RECORD IS PLAYED BACKWARD AND WHICH MAY BE PERCEPTIBLE
AT A SUBLIMINAL LEVEL WHEN THIS RECORD IS PLAYED FORWARD."" In
February 1983, the Arkansas State Senate passed a similar record-
labeling bill by a vote of 86 to 0.
     Contributing to the quasi-occult status of these rumors is
the difficulty of checking them out on home audio equipment. You
pretty much have to take someone else's word for it, or dismiss
the rumors out of hand.
     From a technical standpoint, there are four simple ways to
conceal a verbal message on a recording. The most obvious is to
record the message at a very low volume. The message may then be
recovered by turning the volume up while playing the record or
tape. If the message is faint enough, though, noise levels of home
equipment may garble it. If the accompanying music or lyrics are
loud enough, or if the message itself is indistinct or
electronically modified, it may be hard to hear on any equipment.
     A second gimmick is to record a message on one stereo track
only. Records and tapes have two independent recordings, of
course, normally played simultaneously for stereo effect. On a
record, each stereo track occupies on one side of the V-shaped
groove for the needle. On a tape, the tracks are recorded in
parallel lanes of the magnetic material. The two tracks are called
""right"" and ""left"" after the stereo speakers they will play on.
Otherwise, the tracks are interchangeable -- the sound mixer can
put anything he or she wants on each track. A message on one track
can be masked by simultaneous loud music or lyrics on the opposite
track. With normal stereo balance (or mono equipment) the loud
track drowns out the message track. At home, single-track messages
can be recovered by adjusting the stereo balance so that only the
desired track plays. Sometimes this trick also makes indistinct
words clearer. Even if the words are not exclusively on one track,
they may happen to be more audible on one track.
     A message could be recorded at a speed different from the
rest of the record. Then the record would have to be played faster
or slower than usual to recover the message. Unless the message
was at one of the standard speeds (say, 45 rpm on a 33 1/3 rpm
record), it could not be played normally on home equipment.
     The fourth and most commonly alleged trick is to record a
verbal message backward. Reversed speech has several unexpected
features. One is that syllables are not a constant in the reversal
process. A one-syllable word can have two or three syllables when
played backward. Thus ""number nine"" in the Beatles' REVOLUTION 9
reverses to ""Turn me on, dead man"" (or something like it), a jump
from three to five syllables.
     There is no simple way to predict what a word or phrase will
sound like reversed. Obviously, you can't just reverse the
letters.
     Reversed messages are difficult to recover at home. Record
turntables are not built to go backwards. Some have a neutral
setting, in which the pickup and amplifier remain active and you
can turn the record backward by hand. But hardly anyone has a
stead enough hand to produce satisfactory results.
     With patience, it is possible to reverse a cassette
recording. Transfer the music from the original record or tape
onto a blank tape cassette. Place the cassette flat on a table.
Draw our the part of the tape with the suspected message and snip
it off at both ends. Hold the tape segment horizontally. Rotate it
180 degrees, keep it horizontal at all times. This turns the tape
end for end. Splice the reversed tape segment back onto the two
loose ends of the cassette with strong adhesive tape. Reel the
tape back inside the cassette. The sliced segment will play
backward on an ordinary cassette player.
     I rented a recording studio to test the secret-message
rumors. New copiies of the records in question were transcribed on
a quarter-inch master tape. Where rumor alleged that a single
stereo track contained a message, right and left stereo tracks
were transcribed separately. Records with alleged inaudible
messages were treated similarly. To test claims of reversed
messages, recordings on the master tape were edited out and
spliced in backward. Twenty cuts or portions of cuts from sixteen
albums were tested.


""Another One Bites the Dust""
Queen, THE GAME

Rumor: When played backward, the lyrics say, ""It's fun to smoke
marijuana.""
Findings: There is something that sounds like ""It's fun to smoke
marijuana"" in the reversed music. It is repeated over and over. It
might be rendered no less faithfully, however, as ""sfun to scout
mare wanna."" This ""message"" is the reversal of the song title,
which is repeated as a line in the song.
     Let's make a distinction between engineered and phonetic
reversals. When an artist records a verbal statement, reverses it
by turning the tape end for end, mixes the reversed statement onto
a master tape, and has records and tapes produced from the master,
that is an engineered reversal. When the phonetic properties of
song lyrics are such that they can be reversed to sound like
something else, that is a phonetic reversal.
     ""It's fun to smoke marijuna"" is clearly a phonetic reversal.
The lyrics are perfectly plain played forward (""Another one bites
the dust""), no so plain played backward (""sfun to scout mare
wanna""). With an engineered reversal, the opposite should hold
true: gibberish forward, clear as a bell backward. Some are
prepared to believe that phonetic reversals are just as
intentional as engineered reversals -- that the songwriter
painstakinginly planned the phonetic double-entendre. In the
absence of confirming evidence, that just doesn't wash. It's too
easy to find coincidences. If, for example, the letters of the
alphabet are recited in conventional fashion (Ay, Bee, Cee, etc.)
and reversed, at least five sound like English language words. D
reverses to ""eden,"" F becomes ""pray,"" S becomes ""say,"" V becomes
""even,"" and Z becomes ""easy."" ""It's fun to smoke marijuana"" is
likewise a coincidence.


""A Child is Coming""
Jefferson Starship, BLOWS AGAINST THE EMPIRE

Rumor: When played backward, ""son of Satan.""
Findings: Another phonetic coincidence. The repeated ""It's getting
better"" reverses to an iffy ""son of Satan,"" the ""of"" drawn out and
the ""Satan"" strongly accented on the first syllable.


""Eldorado""
Electric Light Orchestra, ELDORADO

Rumor: When played backward, ""He is the nasty one/ Christ, you're
infernal/ It is said we're dead men/ Everyone who has the mark
will live.""
Findings: Coincidence. The supposed message lurks around the line
""On a voyage of no return to see."" Reversed, this passage becomes
the expected syllable salad -- no one hearing it would describe it
as anything but reversed music. Only if you listen while reading
along with what you're supposed to hear will you get anything. The
rumored version of the message is somewhat fudged. The passage
sounds more like ""He's to nasty one/ Christ you are, Christ,
you're fernal/ There wiss uh, we're dead men..."" There is no ""in""
in what is taken to be ""infernal."" The line that is supposed to be
""Everyone who has the mark will live"" isn't even close, though the
syllable count is right.


""Shoo Be Doo""
The Cars, CANDY-O

Rumor: When played backward, the word ""Satan"" repeated
approximately eleven times.
Findings: Coincidence. The rumor refers to the reversal of the ""Shoo
be doo, shoo be doo, shoo be doo..."" near the end of the song. Given
the mysterious logic of reversed phonemes, these three-syllable units
can be hard as a repeated two-syllable word. The word sounds a little
like ""Satan.""


""Snowblind""
Styx, PARADISE THEATER

Rumor: According to a mimeographed list of suspect records distributed
by Congressman Dornan, the words ""Satan move through our voices"" when
played backwards.
Findings: Negative. Despite repeated listenings, it was not even
possible to identify the part of the reversed track that Dornan et al.
are talking about.


""Stairway to Heaven""
Led Zeppelin, untitled, a.k.a. STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN

Rumor: In reverse, ""I live for Satan... The Lord turns me off...
There's no escaping it... Here's to my sweet Satan... There's power in
Satan... He will give you 666.""
Findings: Coincidence. If you listen very carefully to the ""And it
makes me wonder"" lines in reverse, you'll hear something approaching
""There's no escaping it."" A better description is ""There's no escape
do."" Knock of the last syllable, and you have ""There's no escape,"" a
complete, intelligible sentence in reverse. It's there, all right, but
it's not an unlikely enough coincidence to -- well, make you wonder.
      The ""Satan"" in ""I live for Satan"" is good and clear. The ""I live
for"" part isn't. The other alleged lines are unremarkable. All are
phonetic reversals of the entirely lucid forward lyrics and obviously
just accidents.


""When Electricity Came to Arkansas""
Black Oak Arkansas, BLACK OAK ARKANSAS and RONCH AND ROLL

Rumor: In reverse, ""Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan. He is God. He
is God.""
Findings: The BLACK OAK ARKANSAS cut was reversed. Again, pairs of
reversed syllables are being freely interpreted as ""Satan."" ""He is
God"" was not identifiable.


""Rain""
The Beatles, HEY JUDE

Rumor: Unintelligible lyrics at the end are reversed.
Findings: A true engineered reversal and not really a secret. ""Rain""
seems to have been the first popular recording to incorporate an
obviously reversed lyric. The story is that John Lennon accidentally
spliced the last part of the song in backward and liked the effect.
When reversed, the strange-sounding vocals at the end become
intelligible as a reprise starting with the drawn-out word
""sunshine.""
      The reversal is less apparent to the casual listener than it
might be because the accompanying music is not reversed. The ending
fits in smoothly with the rest of the song, the vocals suggesting a
foreign language.


""Fire on High""
Electric Light Orchestra, FACE THE MUSIC

Rumor: When played backward, ""The music is reversible, but time --
turn back!""
Findings: ""Fire on High"" is instrumental. About twenty-six seconds
into the music, scrambled speech is heard. It is mostly louder than
the accompanying music and begins with a two-syllable unit repeated
several times. The seeming speech lasts for about fourteen seconds.
      Reversing the music confirms that there is a true, engineered
message. In reverse, a voice (Jeff Lynne's?) says, ""The music is
reversible, but time -- turn back! Turn back! Turn back! Turn back!""
All the words are clear and unambiguous. Anyone comparing this to the
alleged reversal on ELO's ""Eldorado"" will have no trouble telling
which is genuine.


""Goodbye Blue Sky""
Pink Floyd, THE WALL

Rumor: In reverse, ""You have discovered the secret message.""
Findings: The ""secret message"" is at the very end of the instrumental
passage following the ""Goodbye Blue Sky"" vocals. It comes just before
the words ""What shall we do"" at the start of the song that is
identified as ""Empty Spaces"" on the record label and as ""What shall we
do now?"" on the record sleeve. Played forward, the message is less
apparent than the FACE THE MUSIC reversal: A reasonably attentive
listener might play THE WALL through and not catch it. It suggests
speech not quite close enough to be overheard. In context this is not
unusual because the ""Goodbye Blue Sky"" instrumental passage includes
""airport noises"" and other sound effects. A loud climax in the music
further masks the unintelligible voice.
      When played backward, the voice (Roger Waters?) plainly intones,
""Congratulations, you have just discovered the secret message. Please
send your answer to old Pink, care of the funny farm..."" As the voice
fades out, there may be another word -- perhaps ""Chalfonte or
""Chelsea"" -- after ""funny farm.""


""Heavy Metal Poisoning""
Styx, KILROY WAS HERE

Rumor: A red sticker on the KILROY WAS HERE cover warns, ""By order of
the Majority for Musical Morality, this album contains secret backward
messages...""
Findings: This is a case of second-generation backward-masking. Styx'
PARADISE THEATER did not contain a backward message, though a lot of
people said it did. So Styx has included a sure enough backward
message on KILROY WAS HERE. It is at the very beginning of ""Heavy
Metal Poisoning."" The reversed speech last about three seconds. There
is no musical background. The words reverse to ""Annuit coeptis. Novus
ordo seclorum."" This is the Latin motto encircling the pyramid on the
back of a dollar bill. The usual translation: ""God has favored our
undertakings. A new order of the ages.""
      The cover sticker's ""Majority for Musical Morality"" is a
fictitious Falwellesque group in the KILROY WAS HERE video. Although
the sticker suggests a plurality of ""messages,"" only one was found.


Space between ""I'm So Tired"" and ""Blackbird""
The Beatles, untitled, a.k.a. THE WHITE ALBUM

Rumor: A reversed message. At the time of the Paul-is-dead stories,
the segue from ""I'm So Tired"" to ""Blackbird"" was offered as evidence.
It was held to contain John Lennon's voice, reveresed, saying ""Paul is
dead, miss him, miss him, miss him."" That interpretation seems
unlikely now, but there is a mysterious low muttering between the
songs.
Findings: The mumbling is actually just to the ""I'm So Tired"" side of
the shiny ""space"" between cuts on the record. Each of the stereo
tracks was recorded separately, twice, and a copy of each track was
reversed. This produced four versions of the two-second passage: right
forward, left forward, right reversed, and left reversed. All were
equally unintelligible. It was not even apparent whether the voice is
forward or reversed. Nor could John Lennon be identified as the
speaker. There are nine or ten syllables. The first six (when played
forward) are a two-syllable unit repeated three times. There is little
or no difference betwen the stereo tracks. Any claimed interpretation
of the sounds seems doubtful.


""Strawberry Fields Forever""
The Beatles, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR

Rumor: It was, of course, claimed that John Lennon says ""I buried
Paul"" at the end. (It's forward, at the very end after the music
fades to complete silence, returns, and starts to fade out again.)
But Lennon told ROLLING STONE that the words are ""cranberry
sauce.""
Findings: They are ""cranberry sauce."" The ""sauce""/""Paul"" part is
indistinct, but the first syllable sounds a lot more like ""cran""
than ""I.""


""Baby You're a Rich Man""
The Beatles, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR

Rumor: On one of the tracks the line ""Baby you're a rich man too""
is sung as ""Baby you're a rich fag Jew,"" a dig at Brian Epstein.
Or some think it's ""rich fat Jew"" and claim it as evidence of
Beatle anti-Semitism.
Findings: Negative. The two stereo tracks are nearly identical.
It's always possible to hear words as similar-sounding words, but
basically, the lyrics jibe with the published version.


""Revolution 9""
The Beatles, untitled, a.k.a. THE WHITE ALBUM

Rumor: Various reversed and/or one-track speech. The reversal of
""Number nine"" to ""Turn me on, dead man"" has pretty much been
discounted as coincidence (though it appears on Congressman
Dornan's list).
Findings: Distinction between lyrics and any hidden message blurs
on ""Revolution 9."" The eight-minute cut is a montage of sounds
collected by John Lennon and Yoko Ono. It includes discordant
music, radio broadcasts, sirens, applause, gunfights, sports
cheers, the crackling of a fire, screams, a baby gurgling, a choir
singing, and much that cannot be identified. For this
investigation, ""Revolution 9"" was transcribed four times, twice on
each stereo channel. One copy of each of the tracks was reversed.
The four resulting versions were compared with each other and
against the original two-channel version.
     ""Revolution 9"" contains a lot of talking. Played in stereo,
forward, the longest stretch of understandable speech is probably
an announcer saying, ""...every one of them knew that as time went
by they'd get a little bit older and a little bit slower...""
     One believable instance of reversed speech occurs: someone
saying ""Let me out! Let me out!"" (once held to represent McCartney
in his totaled Aston-Martin). Two iffy reversals occur on the
backward recording of the right stereo track:""She used to be
assistant"" and ""There were two men..."" Neither is clear enough or
long enough to be convincing. Some of the music, including the
recurring theme, sounds more natural in reverse.
     ""Turn me on, dead man"" is a typical phonetic reversal. The
forward ""number nine"" (repeated throughout the cut) is clear; the
reversal is slurred -- something like ""turn me on dedmun."" It has
been claimed that ""number nine"" must be pronounced with a British
accent or with some careful inflection in order to reverse to
""Turn me on, dead man."" This seems not to be so. As an experiment,
three American-accent renderings of ""number nine"" were reversed.
All sound about as much like ""Turn me on, dead man"" as the record
did. Like the other phonetic reversals, ""Turn me on, dead man""
must be considered a coincidence.
     Much of ""Revolution 9"" is on one stereo track only. Near the
end a voice says ""A fine natural imbalance...the Watusi...the
twist...Eldorado...Eldorado."" ""A fine natural imbalance"" is on the
right track only, though the words that follow are in stereo. One
of the longer bits of speech -- ""Who could tell what he was
saying? His voice was low and his [unintelligible] was high and
his eyes were low"" -- is clear on the left track, a bare whisper
on the right.
     There is a stereophonically concealed ""secret message"" on
""Revolution 9."" The words are on the right track. They begin about
four minutes, fifty-eight seconds into the cut and run for about
twenty-two seconds. They are not likely to be noticed in stereo
because of the much louder left track. The sound of applause
begins on the left track at about five minutes, one second into
the cut. Deafening noises -- the clapping, sirens, music --
continue on the left track until five minutes, forty seconds. It
may or may not have been Lennon's and Ono's intention to conceal
the spoken passage. Given the haphazard quality of ""Revolution 9,""
the concealment may have been accidental. To recover the passage,
the left track must be switched off. The right track can then be
heard to contain a sound like a stopwatch ticking, behind these
words:

     So the wife called, and we better go to see a
     surgeon....[A SCREAM MUFFLES A LINE THAT SOUNDS LIKE
     Well, what with the prices, the prices have snowballed,
     no wonder it's closed.] ...So any and all, we went to
     see the dentist instead, who gave him a pair of teeth,
     which wasn't any good at all. So instead of that he
     joined the bloody navy and went to sea.
                      by William Poundstone
                              1986

     There really are backward messages on rock albums. And the
controversy over ""backward masking"" and ""porn rock"" has inspired a
whole new spate of messages. There may have been more genuine
backward messages in the past few years than ever before.
     The backward message controversy is usually traced to the
1960s and John Lennon's avant-garde sound mixing on such tracks as
""Revolution 9"" on the Beatles' WHITE ALBUM. Lennon probably wasn't
trying to conceal a message so much as create an interesting
sound.
     The matter might have ended right there had it not been for
the Paul McCartney death rumor. College kids tried playing Beatles
records forward, backward, and at various speeds to find ""clues""
to McCartney's fate. In the process they found snippets of speech
from Lennon's experiments. Even after McCartney was found safe and
sound in Scotland, some listeners continued to look for hidden
messages.
     Somehow, fundamentalist Christian groups became convinced
(ca. 1982) that the alleged messages were commercials for devil
worship. Not a single indisputable satanic message has turned up,
but there were scattered attempts to ban or label certain albums.
In 1986 one fundamentalist group announced that the theme song for
the old MR. ED TV show contains the word ""Satan"" when played
backward.)
     Ironically, the publicity accorded nonexistent messages has
inspired several artists -- among them porn rock hearing witness
Frank Zappa -- to hide real background messages in their music.
It's easy to do.
     The performer speaks or sings the message normally, then
reverses the tape, which is mixed into the soundtrack. This is all
accomplished simply enough at any recording studio.
     What's not so simple is playing it back. More home record,
cassette, and compact disk players won't play backward. You can
turn a record backward with a pencil eraser, but it's not good for
the needle or the turntable. The only way to reproduce the message
with full fidelity is to use a professional-quality reel-to-reel
tape player and splice the tape in backward.
     We used the facilities of KLOS radio in Los Angeles to
reverse some recent records containing true backward messages.


""Secret Messages""
Electric Light Orchestra, SECRET MESSAGES

ELO's ELDORADO album was among those alleged to contain satanic
backward masked messages. A patient listening to ELDORADO played
backward reveals no such messages. You hear only what you ought to
hear -- the reversed lyrics of the songs, which sound nothing like
the ""messages"" claimed to be there. In the wake of such
allegations, ELO did put an (innocuous) backward message on their
FACE THE MUSIC album. Perhaps they thought this would show how
silly the allegations were. Instead, the backward-masking people
seized on this as proof that the other ""messages"" were real. In
the latest volley, ELO has named an album after the controversy.
     In Britain (where the backward-masking issue is viewed as an
American eccentricity), the cover of SECRET MESSAGES has a mock
warning label to youth about the hidden label. Word of the albums'
impending release in the United States caused enough of a furor to
chill CBS Records into deleting the cover blurb.
     The reversed message is easy to find. It's at the beginning
of the first song, which is itself called ""Secret Messages."" You
can hear reversed speech when you play the record normally. A
voice intones ""secret messages"" -- forward -- in the middle of the
reversed speech, lest anyone dare be so unhip as to not know
what's going on.
     We transferred a new copy of SECRET MESSAGES to reel-to-reel
tapes and played it backward. The backward message goes: ""WELCOME
TO THE BIG SHOW/ WELCOME TO THE BIG SHOW.""
     That's it.


""Ya Hozna""
Frank Zappa, THEM OR US

""Ya Hozna,"" a six-minute composition on the first record of the
THEM OR US double album, is ENTIRELY backward. The albums' inner
cover, which includes lyrics for the other songs, says, ""backwards
vocal -- you figure it out"" of this cut. It credits Frank and Moon
Zappa, George Duke, and Napoleon Murphy Brock as vocalists.
     Played forward, ""Ya Howza"" sounds like a record played
backward -- reasonably so. The vocals are prominent and
unintelligible. Moon Zappa's voice is curiously recognizable, even
in reverse. It is hard to tell whether the music was recorded
forward or backward.
     When ""Ya Howza"" is played in reverse, you discover that the
music is virtually a palindrome -- it sounds about the same
forward and backward. The voices are all backward. In some cases
they have been modified electronically. Many of the words are
muffled. Even after repeated careful listening on both stereo
tracks, it is difficult to make out many of the lyrics. It doesn't
help that some of the words seem to be stream-of-consciousness
nonsense. Some of the unintelligible stuff sounds like opera.
     Starting at the beginning of the reversed tape -- the end of
the forward tape -- the clearer vocals go like this: ""I am the
heaven, I am the water."" This is in a hymnlike register. ""You are
a lonely little girl./ But your mommy and your daddy hold you."" A
singsong synthesizer voice.
     The most interesting part of the lyrics is an intermittently
orgasmic rap in Moon Zappa's Valley Girl voice. There are three
short monologues:

I'm like green!
I'm like squat!
I'm like soul!
Repeat, like soul!
I'm like pull, push,
Okay, like slow, slow.

You're never too old
Like slow, like slow, like slow
Okay, I like it.


All right, faster, faster,
Go, do it, do it twice,
Yeah, that feels good,
I'm looking great,
Yeah, fer shure!
Like, no way!


""No Anchovies, Please""
J. Geils Band, LOVE STINKS

""No Anchovies, Please"" is a novelty song, really a narration with
sound effects, about a woman who is kidnapped after eating
anchovies. She is taken to a ""foreign-speaking"" country. The sound
effect of the foreign tongue seems reversed. When you do play it
in reverse, it becomes: ""It doesn't take a genius to know the
difference between chicken shit and chicken salad.""


""Darling Nikki""
Prince, PURPLE RAIN

""Darling Nikki,"" cited as porn rock before Congress, is about a
dominatrix in a hotel lobby masturbating with a magazine. In part,
the complaint was that the album cover (flowers, and Prince on a
motorcycle) wasn't explicit enough to warn kids of the suggestive
lyrics. Senator Paula Hawkins apparently was not aware of a
backward message hidden in ""Darling Nikki."" The last thirty-five
seconds of the song is gibberish. The music changes abruptly and
becomes a repeated glottal sound. Then a two-syllable sound is
repeated twice, something like ""heaven, heaven."" Unintelligible
speech follows. At the end is a sound reminiscent of rain or bacon
frying , and wind sounds.
     Played backward, the message becomes:

     Hello, how are you?
     I'm fine 'cause I know that the Lord is coming soon.
     Coming, coming soon.

     It is clearly Prince and the Revolution singing this. The
words are clear but the intonation is funny -- the linger on some
words. Perhaps this is to make the reversed message you hear
playing the record normally a little less conspicuous.
     This is a weird reversal of the supposed secret message
menace. Raunchy forward lyrics conceal a religious secret message.


""Judas Kiss""
Petra, MORE POWER TO YOU

Petra is an obscure group that sings religious songs to a rock
beat. As further proof that things have gone full circle, the
backward-masking controversy prompted Petra to include a wholesome
backward message on their MORE POWER TO YOU album. It is in the
transition between two songs, just before ""Judas Kiss."" Clearly
audible gibberish reverses to this (the husky voice a cross
between George Beverly Shea and Dee Snider): ""What are you looking
for the Devil for, when you ought to be looking for the Lord?""

AFL JoyceM Welcome to the Apple II Music & Sound chat - our discussion will
           be on NoiseTracker - the new FTA music program for the GS.  AFA
           Gene will be our host this evening...Gene, the floor is yours :)

AFA Gene   Hi all... well first I'd like to point out, if y'all aren't aware
           yet, that a spanking new version of NoiseTracker has recently
           been released (9 days ago) and is now available in our New Files
           library. It is version 0.5. I haven't played around with it much
           yet, but it's supposed to fix a lot of the little bugs in 0.3
           (the first version we had online).  NoiseTracker also includes
           the ability to directly import ""modules,"" a term used for a
           certain type of Amiga song file which has become popular among PC
           users using the SoundBlaster sound card.

           Now, via NT, these ""MOD"" files are accessible by the GS. We
           expect to see a lot of activity on this end as far as ports from
           the PC and Amiga go. Note that you should be able to go straight
           to the PC music forum and download any recently uploaded MOD
           songfiles (there was a bug in the first wide release of the PCAO
           software, however, so a bunch of files with dates between around
           March 1991 and September 1991 may not download properly. Note that
           to use these PC MOD files, you'll have to rename the downloaded
           file ""MOD.xxxxxx"" if you want it to show up automatically in NT's
           ""open"" dialog box. (On the PC, all MOD files are named
           ""xxxxxxxx.MOD"" instead.)   Also, if the files are packed with ZIP
           compression, you'll need a program from the Communications Forum
           called AGATE -- it's a terminal program that includes the ability
           to unpack ZIP files.

           Now, I guess the best thing to do would be to talk about our
           favorite songfiles... there have been a few complaints, in fact,
           that people were not being ""descriptive"" enough in their file
           descriptions for uploads in describing the songs.

AFC Eddie  ?

AFA Gene   GA ed

AFC Eddie  Once a MOD file is unpacked with Agate, is a file type change
           needed?

AFA Gene   Nope, since all that NT looks for is the ""MOD."" being the first
           four characters in the filename.

AFC Eddie  OK, Thanks!

Deanna7332 Question...

JonL7      Can you list some of the features of Noisetracker?

AFA Gene   (you don't even need that ""MOD."" if you want to type the name in
           directly.)

Deanna7332 Did any of these mod files have anything to do with FTA's ""Module
           A""

AFA Gene   Sure Jon, right after we answer Deanna's question. Deanna, you
           mean ""Modulae?""

Deanna7332 Yes, that's it.

AFA Gene   Modulae was a demo written by FTA last year. (i'll get to you in a
           sec Doors).  It used SoundSmith v0.95 for all it's music. There
           is no connection between MOD files and Modulae by FTA.

Deanna7332 Throughout the demo it said ""Loading modules""

AFA Gene   Those ""modules"" are not the same as Amiga soundfile ""modules"" --
           you see, what Modulae really was was a ""stringing together"" of a
           bunch of neat little tiny demos that FTA had written. So they
           called each little demo a ""module"" and thus the entire demo as a
           whole, ""Modulae"" (fancy plural of module?)

Deanna7332 Ok I understand.  Thank you. :)

AFL JoyceM Latin, Gene :)

AFA Gene   The term ""MODule"" from the Amiga comes from the idea that all the
           stuff needed to play the songfile (all the instruments + the
           sequence file) are included into one file, the ""module.""

TheDoors1  Gene, I have tried to d/l some recent uploaded MODs in the PC
           music area and still the problem exists.

AFA Gene   As I understand it, the problem was fixed VERY recently (correct
           me on this Joyce) and files uploaded as recently as early
           November still might not work depending on the version of the
           PCAO software that the uploader used.

AFL JoyceM Actually, Gene...I was under the impression that it had been, but
           if Doors is still having a problem, then it must not be fixed.

AFA Gene   What date was the file you tried to d/l, Door?

TheDoors1  umm 11/17, around there

AFA Gene   hmmm.... well i can tell you one thing... if it didn't work, don't
           waste your time again later... the problem is in the Apple
           software's method of d/lling files, and there are no plans to
           upgrade the Apple AO software.

AFL JoyceM I will endeavor to get an answer to that PC downloading
           problem/question :)

ThomasK63  i have a quick question... what can you use to unpack amiga mod
           files? On the PC side, that is.

TheDoors1  Agate Thomas

ELECTMUSIC Doors... what happens on after downloading..

Deanna7332 If it's LZHed you can't unless you have an IBM or
           PC/Transporter.

AFA Gene   If GS-ShrinkIt doesn't have that ability, i don't think there
           exists any such utility on the GS.

TheDoors1  What do you mean Elect?

ELECTMUSIC After you download the file... where do you encounter a problem?

TheDoors1  ok, you know when you download the file and at some point in the
           download the file starts to appear on your screen.  That's when I
           cancel it.

ThomasK63  I am sure soething good can be made w/out resorting to Amiga
           files

AFC Eddie  Yes, Doors, I believe the problem is with the PC software it was
           UL'd with.

TheDoors1  yeah Eddie.

GNO Tim    Amiga MOD files are typically compressed using LHarc.  I've
           uncompressed several on my Unix machine at school.

ThomasK63  good time for someone to make a lharc unpacker...

AFC DYAJim someone might be ;)

GNO Tim    Several people are already

AFC Eddie  Can't wait, Jim!

AFA Gene   Jon, did you have a question?

JonL7      The features of Noisetracker :)

AFA Gene   Oh yes... okay, here goes, in a nutshell, from most important to
           least:


AFA Gene   *  ability to import MOD files

           *  ability to import Soundsmith files

           *  ProDOS 8 based

           *  virtually no editing abilities (not a feature but important to
           know)

AFC DYAJim :)

AFA Gene   *  forgot: and the most important feature of all, the ability to
           hold instrument files in regular system RAM instead of DOC RAM,
           allowing for instruments far beyond the regular 64K limit found
           in ALL other GS music programs.

ThomasK63  I'll buy that!

TheDoors1  I have another question...when you're ready.

AFA Gene   GA Doors

TheDoors1  ok..is it true that NoiseTracker will take in soundsmith files and
           play them more clearly

AFA Gene   Well, as far as ""what you hear,"" yes there is a definite
           difference with some instruments. It does NOT play the sounds
           more ""clearly,"" but it just plays them in a different way. What
           many people seem to like about this ""different way"" is that
           sustained instruments (i.e. instruments designed to be played
           in a loop to simulate a long held note) seem to work better (or
           perhaps simply the way they were originally intended to work).

TheDoors1  I see

Deanna7332 Which takes up more space - MOD or NT  w/soundfile ?

AFA Gene   Deanna, it depends a few things, such as how big the sequence is,
           how many instruments you have, etc. Once you have a lot of
           assorted files, it'll probably average out to be about the same
           give or take a hundred blocks on your HD. So it basically depends
           on whether you prefer to have your instruments separate or not.

Deanna7332 Does playing quality differ with either one ?

AFA Gene   Nope. It's exactly the same either way. Loading time is the same
           too.

AFC Eddie  Can NT save songs as MOD files?

AFA Gene   Nope. It has options for Open and Close module, but these are
           still inactive.

AFA Gene   If there are no more questions, I'd like to talk about which NT
           files out there are the ""hottest,"" since this info could be
           useful to many users who are interested in downloading NT/MOD
           files.

           My personal favorite is ""Lambada,"" which is supplied by FTA with
           the program but is available separately on America
           Online.Everything about this file is really impressive except
           perhaps the sound quality of the horn-ish melody instrument.

           What about y'all, what are your favorite NT files?

AFL JoyceM Gene, there is a classical song for NT, but can't remember the
           name, but it is good.

AFC Eddie  I like Dragnet!

ELECTMUSIC So do I Ed

TheDoors1  I like Seven something

Deanna7332 My most favorite of all mod files is Pleasure Principle

AFC Eddie  <--appreciate's Greg's taste!

AFL JoyceM :)

AFA Gene   Deanna, i assume you got that from a local board?

Deanna7332 I got it from the PC forum here.

TheDoors1  I saw it there also

Deanna7332 I think under ""Pleasure""

AFA Gene   Would you be able to upload it here? If it's really that good, we
           ought to have it available directly in our oun NT lib here (BTW
           folks, we will be releasing a new NoiseTracker software library
           soon!)

AFC Eddie  What a Forum!!!

Deanna7332 That sounds great!

AFL JoyceM Gene, do you think it will be possible for synthLAB files to be
           converted to MOD files?

AFL JoyceM MOD files?

AFA Gene   I doubt it, Joyce. The formats are so diametrically opposed in
           their entire basis of their file formats that it wouldn't be
           worth the time for a programmer to develop such a convertor.

Deanna7332 Isn't it possible to move the mod file from the PC forum to our
           music library?

AFA Gene   But..... it might be worth the time for a MIDI File Format to MOD
           convertor, since these two formats are more widely accepted.

Nuzz       they have nothing better to do Gene

ELECTMUSIC Gene.. some interesting similarities with DTune and NTracker

AFA Gene   They lose the file, tho, Deanna. :)

AFL JoyceM In what way, Greg?

ELECTMUSIC Both Prodos 8

Deanna7332 Shhh they won't know a thing :)

ELECTMUSIC I also believe Bill uses a shuttling of sound data between Doc
           Ram and Ram.

AFC Eddie  Interesting, Greg.

ELECTMUSIC Thats how he gets some of the excellent instrument quality

AFC Eddie  But Diversitune has that one distinction:  MIDI input.

AFL JoyceM Deanna, we would greatly appreciate it if you would upload that
           'Pleasure' song to our library :)

ELECTMUSIC Agreed Ed.. one of the factors FTA doesn't like to incorporate
           into their programs.

Deanna7332 I'll u/l it tonight if possible.

AFL JoyceM Thanks :)

AFC Eddie  Thanks, Deanna!

AFL JoyceM I will send Bill B a copy of NoiseTracker + some MOD files...to
           see what comments we get from him (will send when I get back).

AFC DYAJim What ever happened to that diversitune upgrade that was talked
           about ?

ELECTMUSIC That would be interesting Joyce

AFC Eddie  Bill apparently still working on it, Jim.

ELECTMUSIC I am sure he would appreciate the Prodos 8

AFC DYAJim good..

AFL JoyceM Jim...RSN....he was hoping by Christmas (this year), but he is
           soooo busy with his job, who knows?

AFC DYAJim Oh yeah, I noticed the speed calcuation in NT .5 is inaccurate
           :)

AFC DYAJim I recall he has set a lot of Christmas projected dates :)

ELECTMUSIC He was one of the first ""Free Tools"" experts in breaking all the
           rules for economic sake.

AFC DYAJim like for the vaporware DT inst editor like 2 years ago.

Deanna7332 Are there any Christmas Mod or NT songs?

AFC Eddie  Oh yeah, Diversi-Editor!

AFL JoyceM I know, Jim - but that I know he has been working on.

AFC DYAJim he projected Christmas for it, and it never came :)

AFA Gene   Not yet in AMS, but hopefully the Holiday Contest will change all
           that. :)

AFC DYAJim I look foreward to any upgrades..

AFL JoyceM Not that I am aware of Deanna - you have some?  hint, hint

Deanna7332 Nope sorry.  I was hoping there were some that could be u/led
           here

AFC DYAJim I'll be breaking out the xmas tune book rsn.. I should be able to
           midi a few :) (which rules out nt)

AFL JoyceM Question...

AFC Eddie  It would be more appropriate to have a converter from Appleworks
           spreadsheet to MOD than from MIDI!

AFL JoyceM If I got ahold of an Amiga song (MOD) disk...how would I convert
           them for here?

AFA Gene   You mean an Amiga-formatted disk?

AFL JoyceM Yes

AFC DYAJim Ack.. methinks you need an amiga and a null modem cable or a
           modem.

AFA Gene   Methinks Jim is right

AFC DYAJim LOL!!  Design your music in the spreadsheet then import to NT :)
           IT might actually have better editing?!! :)

AFC Eddie  Right!

AFL JoyceM Me thinks he is right.  If I had them upload to me, would that
           work?

AFA Gene   Yep; should work like a charm.

AFC DYAJim Yah.. as long as they're coming from an amiga

AFL JoyceM Great....I will work on that when I get back  (making note now).

AFL JoyceM Gene, will you get some of those files (NT) sent to that area
           tonight?  If so, I will leave the needed message :)

AFA Gene   That's all I have planned for tonight's chat, Joyce. Yep, I'll
           move some files right now.

AFL JoyceM Thanks...

AFL JoyceM Then we should have our NoiseTracker Library by end of the week in
           AMS :)

ELECTMUSIC Gene... quick question:  Are you launching NTracker from a 3.5
           disk?

AFL JoyceM Okay, guys...I will see you all the week of December 11th (may the
           4th) as I am off on vacation.

AFA Gene   Yep greg

AFC JohnC  Where are you going?

ELECTMUSIC Do you encounter out of memory problems

AFL JoyceM Night all...and Gene, thanks for an excellent chat and great
           explanations of NoiseTracker.

Nuzz       Joyce, I have good news for FutureSound owners. SoundConvert will
           support it in the first release

AFC Eddie  Great, Mike!

AFA Gene   Greg, i always keep my RAMdisk at 0 when using noisetracker. Not
           only are

AFC JohnC  Mike...SoundConvert...released?

AFL JoyceM Great, Mike.  When can we get SoundConvert, Mike? and FutureSound
           :)

AFA Gene   there a couple of bugs with memory management, but if you're
           loading in a MOD file that's really big, NT will eat your RAMdisk.

AFC Eddie  Sounds good.

Nuzz       The manual is being ""layout"". Release date should be about 1st
           week of Dec

ELECTMUSIC Tnxs Gene

AFC JohnC  YES.......WTG Nuzz!!!!!!!!

Deanna7332 Yes, why is there on some MOD files a stop somewhere in the middle
           ?

Deanna7332 That's really frustrating!

AFL JoyceM Mike, leave me E-Mail on when and how I can send your the $$ to
           get it.

AFL JoyceM Again...night all

Nuzz       gee John, I had to do something to explain the delay :)

ELECTMUSIC Thanks Gene for a GREAT chat!

AFC Eddie  Yes, Gene!  Great!

AFA Gene   Thanks Greg, 'night!

AFA Gene   thanx, see y'all later :)

Copyright 1987 Bob Szekely.

    John Michael Osbourne, (known as ""Ozzy"" to his fans), has in his long 
career as vocalist for Black Sabbath had his work with the group misconstrued 
as advocating Satanism.  In a 1983 radio special featuring Ozzy, the 
interviewer expressed precisely this point; ""...Ozzy has always been shrouded 
in the darkest of Satanic imagery.  Yet if you really listen to his music, 
you'll find that what he is saying differs greatly from his image....""(1)  Even 
the group's image has often been described as ""occult and diabolic"".(2)

    The important point to remember here is to differentiate between appearance 
and reality.  Although the name ""Black Sabbath"" conjures up images of witches 
and sorcerers paying homage to Satan for the powers bestowed upon them, this 
does not make it safe to assume that the group that went by this name 
necessarily drew the inspiration from the occult.(3)  The closest they ever 
came to it was a gothic horror film featuring Boris Karloff as narrator; they 
adopted their name directly from the name of this film.(4)  Black Sabbath was 
involved in the black arts as much as Karloff practiced casting spells off-
screen.  Tony Iommi, the group's guitarist, summed it up best when he described 
the group as having basically ""...the same appeal as a horror movie.  It's all 
an act.""(5)










    Just as their film counterpart did, Ozzy and Sabbath found the occult 
mythos to be an effective vehicle for powerful social commentary; particularly 
when put in the context of heavy-metal rock and roll.  Ozzy himself noted that 
there are ""...people who pick up my [album] cover[s] and go...'This guy's got 
to be singing about Devil, doom, death and destruction.'  Which is not the 
case....""(6)

    The late Lester Bangs likened the group to Bob Dylan and William Burroughs, 
describing them all as ""...moralists...trying to deal with a serious present 
situation in an honest way....""(7)  Ozzy and Black Sabbath merely bring to 
light the many evils of our world in their work, to try and make us realize 
that we are all victim to their influence.  They hope to make us recognize 
these evils so that we may take up arms against them; a point Ozzy emphatically 
stresses:  ""...one thing everybody has got to understand about Black Sabbath's 
lyrics.  They're not downer lyrics, they're just telling everybody where it's 
at...""(8)  He also cites the group's most controversial tune, ""Black Sabbath"", 
as a response to the ignorant hippie culture still force when the tune was 
written in 1970:  ""The hippies said: 'The world is beautiful man.' (sic)  You 
only had to look around you to see how crappy it was.  It was ridiculous 
listening to that stuff, let alone playing it, so we just wrote about the world 
the way it really was and how it affected us - and we felt better in ourselves 
because we were really being honest....""(9)

    I   1   HAVE YOU EVER THOUGH ABOUT YOUR SOUL-
        2   CAN IT BE SAVED?
        3   OR PERHAPS YOU THINK THAT WHEN YOU ARE DEAD
        4   YOU JUST STAY IN YOUR GRAVE.
        5   IS GOD JUST A THOUGHT WITHIN YOUR HEAD OR IS
        6   HE A PART OF YOU?
        7   IS CHRIST JUST A NAME THAT YOU READ IN A BOOK
        8   WHEN YOU WERE AT SCHOOL?

    II  9   WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT DEATH DO YOU LOSE
        10  YOUR BREATH OR DO YOU KEEP YOUR COOL?

        13  WELL I'VE SEEN THE TRUTH - YES I'VE SEEN 
        14  THE LIGHT AND I'VE CHANGED MY WAYS.
        15  AND I'LL BE PREPARED WHEN YOU'RE LONELY

        18  FRIENDS MIGHT SAY 
        19  IF THEY NEW YOU BELIEVED IN GOD ABOVE
        20  THEY SHOULD REALISE BEFORE THE CRITICISE
        21  THAT GOD IS THE ONLY WAY TO LOVE.

    IV  23  IS YOUR MIND SO SMALL THAT YOU HAVE TO FALL
        24 IN WITH THE PACK WHEREVER THEY RUN

        32  SAY YOU DON'T BELIEVE?
        33  YOU HAD THE CHANCE BUT YOU TURNED IT DOWN
        34  NOW YOU CAN'T RETRIEVE.










    VI  35  PERHAPS YOU'LL THINK BEFORE YOU SAY THAT
        36  GOD IS DEAD AND GONE
        37  OPEN YOUR EYES, JUST REALIZE THAT HE IS THE
        38  ONE.
        39  THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN SAVE YOU KNOW FROM
        40  ALL THIS SIN AND HATE.
        41  OR WILL YOU STILL JEER AT ALL YOU HEAR?
        42  YES!-I THINK IT'S TOO LATE.

    In this piece, the group asserts a belief in an afterlife and spiritual 
redemption.  As grisly as the image of a hanged pontiff is, its shock value is 
a necessary part of the message:  They reject religious dogma, stating that a 
belief in God, in one's own heart, is the only guiding light to help one inn 
his life (lines 11/12, 39/40).  Furthermore, the reject religious hypocrisy 
(lines 5/6, 7/8) and peer pressure (verses III, IV) as excuses for not 
accepting God.  To clarify further:  following the crowd does not justify 
shrugging responsibility for one's own actions.

    After re-reading, it becomes obvious that this song is an ascerbic critique 
of atheism; (line 35/36) I refer here again to verses three and four.  In these 
two verses, the picture painted in one of Godless conformity and how it's 
viewed as being as foolish as Paganism.  These lyrics set an example for the 
listener by relating personal experience (lines 13-16).  However, for those who 
cannot accept this the group has no recourse but to condemn them, although 
rather ironically; they hope that their rhetorical loss of faith in the 
listener will open his eyes (line 42).










                           B L A C K   S A B B A T H 



            WHAT IS THIS, THAT STANDS BEFORE ME?
            FIGURE IN BLACK, WHICH POINTS AT ME
            TURN ROUND QUICK AND START TO RUN
            FIND OUT I'M THE CHOSEN ONE.  OH, NO!
            
            BIG BLACK SHAPE WITH EYES OF FIRE
            TELLING PEOPLE THEIR DESIRE
            SATAN'S SITTING THERE, HE'S SMILING
            WATCHES THOSE FLAMES GET HIGHER AND HIGHER
            OH, NO, NO, -- PLEASE GOD HELP ME!
            
                IS THIS THE END MY FRIEND?
                SATAN'S COMING 'ROUND THE BEND
                PEOPLE RUNNING 'CAUSE THEY'RE SCARED
                THE PEOPLE BETTER GO AND BEWARE
                NO, NO!  PLEASE--NO!!
                
                
    The all time controversy winner!  Is this not irrefutably  THE song about 
Black Magic in rock?  It's all so obvious, suffuse with evil imagery; Satan, 
walls of flame, figure in black, and damnation at the end.  Yes, I see the 
images too; it definitely concerns Black Magic.  Then again, Shakespeare's 
Macbeth employed scenes of witches involved in conjurations; does that mean 
that Shakespeare was a warlock?  Poe used to write sardonic tragedies about 
twisted murderers and the bizarre nature of acts, did that make him an evil, 
leering, demented killer?  Did either of them advocated what they wrote about?  
One has to remember that writing about something is not necessarily the same as 
emulating it.  Tony Iommi spoke out quite strongly about this:  ""People are 
bringing us down saying that we are a Black Magic group.  I think they must be










getting mixed up with Black Widow.  We don't do any sacrifices on stage, and 
we're not on a black magic kick.  We wanted to do heavy numbers and the guitar 
riffs we worked out were more suited to evil things than love.  We play songs 
about black magic, but they are more likely to be against than for it.""(12)  

    By now, you're probably asking yourself who Black Widow is, right?  Then 
it's time for a little history:

        Sabbath, before they were known as Sabbath, had the same line-up but 
two earlier names.  The first one was Polka Tulk, which seemed sure to doom 
them to obscurity.(13)  The soon realized this and changed the group's name to 
Earth.  Now, Earth was a blues band at the end of the English blues boom.  As 
if that wasn't bad enough, they soon discovered that not only was there another 
group named Earth, but they had also released a single.  To avoid confusion, 
they changed their name again.(14)  But what made them decide on that name?  
Just ask Ozzy:  ""I just liked the name Black Sabbath because of the succession 
of vowel sounds.(15)  If that sounds ludicrous just consider this:  Sabbath was 
""...the first of the really committed, loud and heavy bands...""(16)  They 
needed a name to match the gut-wrenching power they were developing.  Tony knew 
that he wanted Sabbath to be noticed above all the rest of the British blues 
bands:  ""We wanted something of our own that we'd like and people would like.  
And we wanted something loud!""










    Tony didn't hate the blues.  He'd cut his teeth as a guitarist on the likes 
of The Shadows, Buddy Holly and Django Rheinhardt, developing his own style 
from there.  But he realized the group had no future in the blues:

        'We couldn't keep playing 12-bars forever.  We just got fed up with 
Earth music.  It was jazz, blues stuff.  It was good for practice but nothing 
else.'

    In the late 'Sixties, blues groups were a dime a dozen in Birmingham and 
interest was waning in the blues boom due to the glut of groups.  One man, by 
the name of Jim Simpson, had heard Earth around the Birmingham club circuit and 
understood what they were trying to do.  He decided to take them under his 
wing.  With the aid of his massive record collection, Jim expanded the group's 
horizons in the areas of jazz and blues.  He introduced them to artists like 
Wes Montgomery, Count Basie and Jimmy Rushing.  It was from Rushing in 
particular that they derived the repetitive riff style so readily noticeable in 
their later incarnation as Black Sabbath.

    The Count Basie influence is evidenced in the song ""Wicked World"" from the 
first album; Sabbath drummer Bill Ward uses a ""'sighing hi-hat'...in the manner 
of Basie's drummer Jo Jones.""










    The influence is subtle, almost subliminal.  Yet it is one which was not 
thought capable of hard, 'heavy' rock bands in the late 'Sixties.  Although Led 
Zeppelin and Jimi Hendrix also had their work steeped in blues and jazz 
derivations (Hendrix' ""Third Stone From the Sun"" and Zeppelin's version of 
Willie Dixon's ""I Can't Quit You Baby"" from their first album), neither was 
able to match the intense energy of Black Sabbath.  Iommi has always had a 
preference for music with an original, distinct style of its' own; as an 
example, he mentions guitarists Joe Pass and Alvin Lee as two of his strongest 
songwriting influences.

    It would also be necessary that Sabbath develop a unique, distinctive style 
and image of their own.  Though they had changed their name from Earth to Black 
Sabbath to avoid confusion with the other Earth; at the same time another group 
emerged by the name of Black Widow ""...who WERE profoundly influenced by the 
occult, had a male witch as a patron, and wrote pieces like ""Come to The 
Sabbat.""  Unfortunately, Sabbath was constantly reaping the benefits of Widow's 
publicity.

    Sabbath was a group that never minced words.  If they saw something as 
destructive, they would be sure to rub the listener's face it it.  They did not 
want their point to be missed.

    With their straightforward, sometimes brutal way of looking at things, they 
try to shock the listener's conscience back into awareness.  The imagery of 
""Hand of Doom"", from the Paranoid album, is candid and condemning; it is a 
strong statement against drug addiction and rightly so...

    Many people felt the group's overall direction was pessimistic and had a 
negative effect on its listener's due to that.  ""Ozzy insisted that if people 
thought he was having a bad effect on the minds of young kids, they should go 
and watch the TV news where real murder and mayhem were a way of life, and 
shown night after night."" (18)

    Sabbath was never negative in their message; they were simply truthful 
about waht they saw as wrong in the world.  If you ""Strip away the horror 
stories, the imagery and the hysteria, (and) turn down the amps a notch...you 
have a well-rehearsed, solid blues and rock band, powered by a dedication to 
well defined objectives.""  On the top of the list of those objectives was 
truth; Sabbath never feared facing that truth squarely, regardless of what many 
people thought of them.

Long, long, time ago,
I can still remember,
When the local calls were ""free"".
And I knew if I paid my bill,
And never wished them any ill,
That the phone company would let me be...

But Uncle Sam said he knew better,
Split 'em up, for all and ever!
We'll foster competition:
It's good capital-ism!

I can't remember if I cried,
When my phone bill first tripled in size.
But something touched me deep inside,
The day... Bell System... died.

And we were singing...

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

Is your office Step by Step,
Or have you gotten some Crossbar yet?
Everybody used to ask...
Oh, is TSPS coming soon?
IDDD will be a boon!
And, I hope to get a Touch-Tone phone, real soon...

The color phones are really neat,
And direct dialing can't be beat!
My area code is ""low"":
The prestige way to go!

Oh, they just raised phone booths to a dime!
Well, I suppose it's about time.
I remember how the payphones chimed,
The day... Bell System... died.

And we were singing...

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

Back then we were all at one rate,
Phone installs didn't cause debate,
About who'd put which wire where...
Installers came right out to you,
No ""phone stores"" with their ballyhoo,
And 411 was free, seemed very fair!

But FCC wanted it seems,
To let others skim long-distance creams,
No matter 'bout the locals,
They're mostly all just yokels!

And so one day it came to pass,
That the great Bell System did collapse,
In rubble now, we all do mass,
The day... Bell System... died.

So bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

I drove on out to Murray Hill,
To see Bell Labs, some time to kill,
But the sign there said the Labs were gone.
I went back to my old CO,
Where I'd had my phone lines, years ago,
But it was empty, dark, and ever so forlorn...

No relays pulsed,
No data crooned,
No MF tones did play their tunes,
There wasn't a word spoken,
All carrier paths were broken...

And so that's how it all occurred,
Microwave horns just nests for birds,
Everything became so absurd,
The day... Bell System... died.

So bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

We were singing:

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?

'Cause she's good enough for me!      With her pagan poetry!

Shall we sing a verse for Venus,    Well the Christians all are humming
Of the Gods she is the meanest,     Cause they say their God is coming,
Cause she bit me on my...elbow      Our God came three times this evening
And it's good enough for me.        And that's good enough for me.

I was singing Hari Rama              We will pray with those Egyptians
With my friend the Dalai Lama        Build pyramids to put our crypts in

One-eyed Odin we will follow      We will pray to Zarathustra

Hare Krishna gets a laugh on         I'll arise at early mornin'

but She's good enough for me!        And that's good enough for me!       
 
And what about this Bacchus,         Diana is a little spikey
Who lives just to raise a ruckus?    And she is a little dyke-ey
Loosens women so they'll f*** us,    You don't have to be a Psych-e
Well, that's good enough for me!     To know that's right for me!

Lilith wears a lacy nightie        That Bob Larson shrieks and hollers
And She is a little flighty        Fighting demons in his callers
She will get you all excite-y      Save his program: SEND YOUR DOLLARS! 
She's wet-dream enough for me!     And that's good enough for me.

                      (Tune: ""Lily the Pink"")

   Now here's a story, a little bit gory,
   A little bit happy, a little bit sad.
   About a drink called Imperium Compound
   And how the SCA's been had!                       (1)

   Chorus: Oh we think, we think, we think,
           The King is a fink, a fink, a fink,
           A figure of respectability
           Rules the Kingdom thru Imperium Compound
           The results are plain to see!

   Duke Treegirtsea, was known for his courtesy,
   And his fighting prowess was well-renowned
   Took a thimble of Imperium Compound
   And the poor Duke nearly drowned!                  (2)

   Words with Andy, you never should bandy
   He is strong enough to kill a moose
   He drinks copious Imperium Compound
   But he can't take Jungle Juice!                    (2)

   Meriwold, he's the bane of a Skald, he
   Has no attributes of which to sing
   Polite and formal, incredibly normal,

   A King's Crown could be done.
   Drank a little Imperium Compound
   And became the Aten King, first one!                     (5)
11
   There was Astra, no one ever asked her
   And she was for having fun!
   Then she sampled Imperium Compound,
   And today she is a nun   \\ not better!\\               (19)

   There's good old Igor, his prowess is meager
   For he never learned to water-ski!
   But instead he drinks Imperium Compound
   Then he howls and climbs a tree!  \\Hoo Hah!\\          (19)

   Then there's Dagan, his brother's the Ka-Khan,
   Which is quite funny in a King!
   If he gets hooked on Imperium Compound
   There'll be new songs to sing!    \\ Oh, really?\\       (19)  

   Fredrick of Holland, who dwells in the Northland,
   A Master from the West, he came!
   Spends all his money for Imperium Compound
   That's why his garb's always the same!                   (20)

   Now Gyrth Oldcastle, round as a beer barrel,
   Once chose to quarrel with a certain Bard;
   The poet served him with Imperium Compound,
   And left him rendered down to lard!                      (20)

   Many tales abound of Imperium Compound
   And its' strange effects on Royalty,
   But after an hour, this song has no power,
   And by now, it's boring ME!                             (16)

   Duchess Malinda, who doesn't do windas
   But she does a lot of Duchess Things,
   But give her a LOT of Imperium Compound,
   And she sings and sings and sings and sings and sings!   (5)

   AltChorus: Oh it's too long, too long, too long
              To sing the whole song, the song, the song
              Longer than a Royal Court, it is!
              But sing it serial, this ditty Imperial
              And you'll be a bardic whiz!                 (5)

                                             IMPERIUM COMPOUND    
                                             (Atenveldt Verses)

   Now here's a story, a little bit gory,
   A little bit happy, a little bit sad.
   About a drink called Imperium Compound
   And how the SCA's been had!                       

   Chorus: Oh we think, we think, we think,
           The King is a fink, a fink, a fink,
           A figure of respectability
           Rules the Kingdom thru Imperium Compound
           The results are plain to see!

   Mongol Hordemen, those free-living swordsmen
   Subverting the Kingdoms from underneath!
   Have no use for Imperium Compound
   Except perhaps to brush their teeth!

   AltChorus: Oh we fink, we fink, we fink,
              The Khan and the Kink, the Kink, the Kink,
              And the Board, their Great Senilities!
              The Western Irgun, drinks Imperium Compound
              And we're BACK, with results you'll see!    

   Lady Laurel, with Authority Royal,
   Passes and rejects our heraldry
   She needs a swig of Imperium Compound
   Then perhaps she'd deign to talk to me!            

   Lady Trude thought it her duty
   To turn a social wrong into a Right
   Proved her point with Imperium Compound
   And showed that Cheshire Cats can fight!  //and scratch//

   The Board of Directors styled themselves The Electors
   And another con they tried to swing
   Now the BoD drinks Imperium Compound
   So we no longer need a King!                        

   AltChorus: Oh the Bod, the BoD, the BoD,
              It thinks it is God, is God, is God,
              The figure of Supreme Authority!
              And if we O.D.'d on Imperium Compund
              there'd be no need for Royalty!          

   Oh, MEDIEVAL Net, we thought it was all wet
   With witty remarks, and other kinds of sass
   We'll feed our computers on Imperium Compound
   And BYTE the BoD right on its' righteous ass!         

   Good old Duncan was often drunken
   Chasing all the ladies fair
   He bathed himself in Imperium Compound
   Now he has a little savoir faire!                     

                    (more)


  ATEN IMPERIUM (cont.)

   Ioseph of Locksley, never changes his socks, he
   Runs around looking like a Cavalier,
   He stocked up on Imperium Compound
   And he has enough to last for years and years!        

   AltChorus: Oh they forgot, forgot, forgot
              The Locks-e-ly Plot, the Plot, the Plot!
              And it works the best when it is underground!
              It isn't a hassle for a green-and-white tassle
              They're the ones that BREW Imperium Compound!  

   Trelon of the Wood, he was very good, he
   Was a leader that had never been beat before;
   But Caid had Imperium Compound,
   And Imperial Roman Caid won the War!  //with help!//   

   In Tyr Ysgithr, it's regularly whispered there
   That the Kingdom is ruled over by a King    // What's THAT? //
   They're ""democratic"" and quite erratic....
   They've forgot the purpose of the whole damn thing!     

   King Sir Mark von, with his pretty white suit on,
   Rules the Kingdom both with Grace and Purity!
   He never touches Imperium Compound
   At least not where anyone else can see!               

   Duke Sir Deaton, was never beaten
   On the field, or in the drinking hall;
   At the Catbox War with Caid,
   Left thirty bodies piled against the wall!             

   Denis O'Titans was good at smitin'
   A Locksley Monster in every single way!
   Drank a little Imperium Compound
   And ATE Deaton's sword that day  // No! REALLY! //       

   Wotan the Mongoloid, a little bit paranoid,
   But a nice guy none the less;
   Drank a mess of Imperium Compound
   Now he's Justin du Roc, I confess!                       

   Then there's Duke Reynard, with a face like a St. Bernard
   Of the Dukes, he is the homliest
   He tends to toke up on Imperium Compound
   And go out and whomp on anybody's best!                   

   This song'll bedevil the folks at a revel,
   And most of the time it will annoy the King,
   So take a drink of Imperium Compound
   And let's go Royalty-bedeviling!                        

   Duchess Anna is quite a fan-a
   Going on a wartime shopping spree!  \\ War Point!\\
   Took a drink of Imperium Compound
   And shopped so fast we couldn't see! \\ Z-o-o-o-om!\\    (5)

                     (more)


  ATEN IMPERIUM (Cont.)

   Lyn of Whitewolfe, made of the right stuff,
   Twice the Queen of Atenveldt;
   Took a drink of Imperium Compound
   And the Kingdom of Caid before her knelt!              

   Duke Sir Brion, and Duke Sir Trelon,
   Won the Crown with regularity;
   Drank a lot of Imperium Compound,
   And founded a dynasty!                                 

   Stephan von Geist, was most awful nice,
   And a chivalrous fighter without any doubt
   Took a swig of Imperium Compound
   And won the Crown his first time out!                    

   All the Crusadenes were big, but not mean,
   And the finest fighters in the town.
   But they all drank Jerusalem Compound,
   Winning Crown after Crown after Crown!                 

   Good Duke Arthur couldn't get no farth-er
   A Norman King in Aten Land
   Drank too much of Imperium Compound
   And went off to conquer Engel-land!                    

   Then King Richard, a bit of a bitch, heard
   A King's Crown could be done.
   Drank a little Imperium Compound
   And became the Aten King, first one!                    

   Duchess Malinda, who doesn't do windas,
   But she does a lot of Duchess Things,
   But give her a LOT of Imperium Compound,
   And she sings and sings and sings and sings and sings!   

   Duke Sir Brion, with his pretty white suit on,
   Is a model of goodness and purity
   Never touches Imperium Compound
(spoken:) And I'll sell ya seashore property in Yuma, too!  

   Optional last verse:

   Many tales abound of Imperium Compound
   And its' strange effects on Royalty,
   But after an hour, this song has no power,
   And by now, it's boring ME!                            

   AltChorus: Oh it's too long, too long, too long
              To sing the whole song, the song, the song
              Longer than a Royal Court, it is!
              But sing it serial, this ditty Imperial
              And you'll be a bardic whiz!

                recorded: CELTIC CIRCLE DANCE
                          WTP-0002C

        Last night I had the strangest dream in this bleak century
        I dreamed that people the world around believed in Chivalry

        I dreamed I saw a Kingly Crown enshrined in laurel leaves
        with Grace and Joy and Purity attendant at his feet

        I dreamed I saw the perfect Knight receive his accolade
        and minstrels sang and children laughed in some soft forest glade

        I dreamed I saw the finest thing that ever man could make
        grow great and strong and undefiled: Pray God I never wake!

        Last night I had the strangest dream in this bleak century
        I dreamed that people the world around believed in Chivalry

               (to the tune of ""Good King Wenceslaus"")

                Locksley Monsters never yield
                on the field of battle
                strike the helm and bash the shield
                make their eyeteeth rattle
                Bodies on the ground will lie
                bones will burst in sunder
                search for Locksleys' enemies:
                You'll find them six feet under!

                              SONG OF IVANOF

            There is a man who we know well that does the best he can
            but he's displayed in armour made of reticulated garbage cans!

            He looks so fine and fair and strong, oh how he plays the man
            and how it's prized, those galvanized, reticulated garbage cans

            The noblest Roman of them all, a good Praetorian
            a combatant who wears no pants, judst reticulated garbage cans!

            Like old Horatius at the Bridge, like the Legions of Valerian
            (O dearie me: those LOVELY knees!)
            and those reticulated garbage cans!

                         C. McCray Bethancourt

         (sung to the tune (obviously) of the 12 Days of Christmas)


1.           The first time I sent my device, The Heralds said to me

            ""It violates the Rule of Three""

2.           The next time I tried it, the Heralds said to me

            ""We changed the forms, and it violates the Rule of
             Three"".

3.           The third time I tried, and the Heralds said to me, 

            ""We upped the fees, we changed the forms, and it
             violates the Rule of Three"".

4.           Another time I tried and the Heralds said to me,
 
            ""We haven't got it, we upped the fees, we changed the 
             forms, and it violates the Rule of Three"".

5.           The fifth time I tried it, the Heralds said to me,  

            ""In a decision rendered by the College of Arms on
             August 1st, A.S. V it was decided that this style of
             heraldic design was not appropriate to the aims and 
             intentions of the Corporate Body. Holy! Holy! Holy! ""

 note: verse 5 is delivered in an extremely fast, mono-
       tone, similiar to a Gregorian Chant.

           "" ....we haven't got it, we upped the fees, we changed the forms,
             and it violates the Rule of Three.""

6.           I tried it a sixth time, and the Heralds said to me,

            ""We changed the rules, &c""

7.           A seventh time I tried and, the Heralds said to me,

            ""It's against the Rule of Tincture, we changed the
             rules, &c""

8.           I tried it once again and the heralds said to me,

            ""It's not a Period design, It's against the Rule of Tincture, We
             changed the rules, &c""

                                * more *



    Heralds Said To Me (cont.)

9.           I sent it in once more, and the Heralds said to me,

            ""We changed the rules again, It's not a Period design,
             it's against the Rule of Tincture, we changed the
             rules, &c""

10. (sung in cold anger)
             The LAST time I sent my device, the Heralds said to me

    (sung in a state of SMUG)
             ""Someone else has got it, &c""




              (nb: every single one of these reasons has been used by the
              CoA, at one point or another, to reject perfectly good
              heraldry, along with some even MORE stupid.  If the shoe 
              fits....................!!!!!!!!)

                        BUGS ON THE BARONESS
                        Tune: Waltzing Matilda
 
           or: Who was that Vermin I saw you with last, Knight?
   or: There may be Lice on all you Knice, but there ain't no Lice on me

           Once there was a Barony howling in the wilderness
           nestled in the Valley where the River doesn't flow
           and the folks were driven buggy by the insects in the Revel Hall
           Authenticity is wonderful, but this doesn't go!

                   Bugs on the Baroness, bugs on the Baroness!
                   That was the cry that you heard all the day
                   and the scratching can be heard from Ysgithr to Ered Sul
                   why did we come here? Let's go away!

           See them all a scratching, nestled in their armour tight
           the fleas have a melee team that's challenging the field!
           call Truly Nolen! Someone's gotta help us out!
           the crabs are nesting in our helms but we'll never yield!

                   (chorus)

           Dawn comes a-breaking, the bugs have won the Coronet...
           flea-infested Conan-clones in piles upon the lawn
           where is the Barony? The bugs have eaten everyone...
           termites got the stick-jocks, and all their sticks are gone!

                   (chorus)

                          ATENVELDT
                          tune: The West's Awake

                  For all the Lands where I have dwelt
                  Oh Atenveldt, Oh Atenveldt
                  till rivers burn and mountains melt
                  lest I forget my Atenveldt
                  From deserts stark to snow-capped peaks
                  from silent lakes and laughing creeks
                  sing: Oh let man find his heart's ease
                  on rocky plains
                  in desert breeze

                  For oft I thought of mighty men
                  who carved a Land with sword and pen
                  and lit a candle, burning bright,
                  that pierced the darkness; stirred the night!
                  tho some are gone their deeds remain
                  this sunny Crown without a stain
                  sing: Oh, their deeds were not in vain!
                  in sunlit days
                  and falling rain.....

                  So raise your banners, blazoned bright
                  Advance the Dream and Shine the Light!
                  in battle's crash and Revel's song
                  raise high the Flag and wave it long!
                  For all the Lands wherein I've dwelt
                  I love you best, my Atenveldt!
                  Sing: Oh the Joy that I have felt!
                  My Atenveldt
                  My Atenveldt

      What the use of wearing panties
      whalebone corsets of your Auntie's
      boxer shorts and other scanties
      best of all is nude
      there's such fun in going bra-less
      now that it's no longer lawless
      'specially if your figure's flawless
      best of all is nude
      nude is what you're born in
      shirts are never torn in
      underwear and lacy flimsies, garter belts and other whimsies
      yards of itchy cloth to put your form in
      ducks all do it, maidens rue it
      even ancient Picts in Britain blue it
      going naked's how to do it
      best of all is nude!

      If your garters aren't elastic
      tie them up in knots fantastic
      (panty hose is something drastic!)
      best of all is nude!
      If you're tired of wearing clotheses
      shed your garment 'mongst the roses
      never mind the old bluenoses
      best of all is nude!
      Nude is best for ducking!
      Worst for horses bucking!
      Moonlit nights will see such sights
          that are very best for fooling round
                              .....and elbows!
      Nudity is grand to see
       a well-known antidote to virginity
      take your clothes off and you'll see:
      best of all is nude!

                   Hi said the Norn, sittin in the sand
                   once I talked to a great Grey Man
                   spun three times and said with a sigh
                   hadn't been for the Runes had his other eye!

                   Chorus: hi diddle i diddle i day

                   Hi said the Lady, dressed in green
                   prettiest thing I've ever seen
                   she went down underneath the hill
                   and came back out of her own free will

                   Brian Boru, on Irish ground
                   walked three times the Island round
                   Norsemen came lookin for a fight
                   just another Irish Saturday night!

                   Hi said Lugh on the banquest night
                   a poet and a player and a good wheelwright
                   a harper and a warrior and none the least:
                   a Druid and he got in to the Feast!

                   Harold Haardrada's face was red!
                   Came to Britain and he wound up dead
                   Stamford Bridge is where he's found
                   got six feet of English ground

                   the Legion with it's Eagles bright
                   marched into the Pictish night
                   met them there upon the sand
                   gave em up to the Wicker Man!

                   eight-legged steed and hound of Hel
                   the one-eyed Man, he loves ya well
                   fire burn and fire spark
                   are you then feared of the dark?

                   The Circle forms, the Circle flows
                   the Circle goes where no man knows
                   Hail to the Lady, one in three:
                   Present is Past and Past is Me!

                   Rhiannon's Birds are still in flight
                   all thru the Day all thru the Night
                   Hail to the Lady, one in Three
                   Present is Past and Past is Thee!

                   Hi said the Lady dressed in white
                   sang the Day and sang the Night
                   sang the Land and sang the Sea
                   sang the Song, and then sang Me!

                   (extra verses) Salt and oil and mirror bright
                                  fire and fleet and candlelight

                                  fill the cup and blessed be!

                                  From the misty crystal sea
                                  came the Lady to the lea
                                  Sword and Roses in Her Hand
                                  spread their seeds thruout the Land

                                  Came the Stag from oaken wood
                                  saw the Lady where she stood
                                  by the fire burning bright
                                  came to know his heart's delight!

                   Present is Past and Past is WE

                   By Oak and Ash and Holy Thorn

               Of those that Rule all Lands above

               When we were Sauvage, Fierce and Wilde
               they came as a Mother to her childe
               they gently raised us from the slime
               and kept our hands from Hellishe Crime
               and made us a Kingdom in their own good time

               Now, Atenveldt forgets the Past
               and thinks on a Day that's coming fast
               when we shall all be....civilized....(puke)
               neat, and clean.....and WELL-ADVISED
               oh won't the Directors be....suprised?!

                    WEAPONS AT THE DOOR

 Being a Polemic concerning the alleged Custom of the West Kingdom concerning 
 checking your Weapons at the Door of the Revel Hall. As the Satire is the 
 Weapon of the Bard, this said Polemic is to be checked at the Door, along with 
 swords, knives, redheaded Ladies and other such Deadly Things.....

         As I roved out to Western Lands to take the Western Air
         I went into a Revel Hall and I saw a Twelfth Night there
         but I was halted at the gate by a Privy Consellor
                 (that's the man who tells the King of the West how to go to
                  the bath room!)
         who told me I would have to check my Weapons at the door

         As I, in my astonishment, stood hung on tenter-pegs
         a Knight came in whose Prouess hung down between his legs
         the Doorman grabbed a greatsword and he struck the Knight full sore
         and gave him a reciept; he left his weapon at the door!

         a Bard was next whose goodly Voice has entertained us all
         but he, too, was prevented from entering the Hall
         and told he could not carry deadly weapons on the floor
         he left his Voice and Harp among the weapons at the door

         a Master entered graciously, a man we all know well
         who holds a 3rd Dan Black Belt, tho this he'd never tell
         the Master struggled valiantly, the Master cursed and swore
         but he left his hands, and feet, as weapons at the door

         the company was jovial, altho a bit dismayed
         for lack of proper cutlery, down to the smallest blade
         for even teeth and fingernails, each can be used in War
         were cut, and pulled, and left behind, as weapons at the door!

         And has their King not loyal Knights that He must be afraid
         of brawling in his Hall and of Assassin's bloody blade?
         the Rights of Men to carry Arms at least WE'VE not foreswore
         and a POX on them that made the Rule of Weapons at the Door!

                           THE STREETS OF ANN ARBOR

               As I walked out thru the streets of Ann Arbor
               as I walked out thru Ann Arbor one day
               I spied a young Mongol all dressed in white linen
               all dressed in white linen and cold as the clay

               I then spied another, done in on the sidewalk
               along with just about six dozen more
               their wounds were all gaping, from mace and from braoadsword
               from claymore and cannon, all dripping with gore

               what caused this grave carnage, I cried to the Monglos
               oh pray what's the reason for this awful sight
               my answer came slowly from under the corpse-pile
               ""It seems that our bark is much worse than our bite.....""

               the answer continued from pale lips a-shaking
               we sang all our songs and believed them as true
               the Dark Horde could never be beaten in battle
               we thought this was what all good Mongols could do...

               we went down to Atenveldt all for to plunder
               ""too large to defend"" was our song every night
               but Atenveldt's different from East, West or Middle
               there, even the bushes have learned how to bite!

               the Clann stole our ponies, the Scraelings our foodstuffs
               we ran into axes in AtenViking hands
               our maidens ran off with one Richard of Arkham
               and we're all that's left to return to our lands

               MacChluarains and Monsters, Lockehaven and Foxmoor
               that Kingdom is BIG and its' fighters are MEAN!
               we fought and we lost, and fled back to Ann Arbor
               we all came back home with results that you've seen

               keep away from that Land with its' cactus and marshes
               it's no place for Mongols who are bent on War
               they count their blows well, but they strick them yet better
               he crawled into his Yurt, and fell, dead, on the floor.....

       tune: the song of the Cowardly Lion, Tin Woodsman and Scarecrow
             in the movie version of the Wizard of Oz

        (Enter the Scarecrow, who singeth:)

        My wife is always nagging; my Prowess it is lagging
        I can't do anything
        she has got a reason, but revenge is out of season
        Oh I wish I could be King!

        If I just had the Crown on, I'd always have a frown on
        and the Barons on a string
        Heads they would be rolling, the Board would be cajoling
        Oh if only I was King!

        I am very fed up with the way this group is set up
        Oh I'd change everything!
        they are so high and mighty with the way that they do fight-ey
        Oh, someday I'll be King!

        Tho my wife is melancholic, and very...vitriolic
        she's a wasp without a sting!
        I'd have to supervise her with a pack of tranquilizers
        If I only was a King......

        (the Tin Woodsman joineth him, and singeth:)

        I grew up kind of cocky, and rather big, and stocky
        and straight as any rod
        on the field I'm a battallion, with the Ladies I'm a stallion
        ...Oh they'd better make me God!

        The other boys are jealous they say I'm over-zealous
        they'd do better to applaud
        the things that I am giving to this Dream that we are living
        oh I wish they'd make me God!

        They say that I'm conceited, but I'm just badly treated
        by people and by BoD
        just think of what they're missing by My Majesty dismissing
        Oh they'd better make me God!

        (the Cowardly Lion creepeth forth, and singeth:)

        Oh I could be a fighter, a great and mighty smiter
        and be the perfect knight
        it's a great and nasty shame, and everyone's to blame
        oh I wish that I could fight!

        Song of the Three (cont.)

        I could be a Cavalier drinking wine and ale and beer
        and be a gorgeous sight
        but it would cost me too much money so it isn't very funny
        oh I wish that I could fight!                               

        Let me at 'em on the field, I would surely make them yield
        to my Power and my Might
        with rattan, shinai and rapier they would nevermore escape here
        If they'd only let me fight

                  (2 - 3 - 4, tell the people what she wore!)

                  It was an itsy bitsy teeny weenie little rabbit fur bikini
                  That she wore, for the first time, that day.
                  An itsy bitsy teenie weenie little rabbit fur bikini
                  And in her apartment she wanted to stay!

                One day in the Kingdom of the Middle
                It happened at a Tourney one day:
                The Mongols invaded the Middle
                But the Middle did not want to play...

                  (eins - zwei - drei, but the Dark Horde wouldn't die!)

                  It was an itsy bitsy tiny teenie Nauseating Mongol weenie
                  That they saw, for the first time, that day.
                  An itsy bitsy tiny teenie Nauseating Mongol weenie
                  And the Mongols did NOT go away!

                Now the Heralds made up a new Rulebook
                And to read it is some kind of gas!
                It's a bureaucrat's dream, this new Rulebook
                Now NOBODY'S blazon can pass!

                  (Win - Place - Show, tell the Heralds where to go!)

                                 (insert Bronx cheer!)

                  I want an itsy bitsy teenie weenie little rabbit fur bikini
                  On my shield, as my blazon, today!
                  An itsy bitsy teenie weenie little rabbit fur bikini
                  But ""that's offensive"" the Heralds all say!

                I sat down at the Revel last evening
                To a feast of green meat, and Rat Pie...
                It was cold, and disgusting, and greasy
                And I just want to upchuck and die!

                  (6 - 7 - 8, tell them what was on your plate!)

                  It was an itsy bitsy teenie weenie little rabbit fur bikini
                  With a side dish of cold cabbage pie!
                  An itsy bitsy teenie weenie little rabbit fur bikini
                  With the fur on, and NOTHING inside!

                      by William Poundstone
                              1983

     Two mentalities are at work here: 1960s rock fans and 1980s
fundamentalist Christians. The idea of phonographically concealed
messages dates from the Paul McCartney death scare of 1969. For
hard-core types, the secret-message rumors never really died. Avid
rock fans have auditioned ever album release since the late 1960s
for hidden nuances. Backward messages, barely audible messages,
and messages on one stereo track only have been alleged. At the
other end of the sociosensual spectrum, fundamentalist Christians
have gotten into the act. TV programs such as PRAISE THE LORD and
THE 700 CLUB have propagated rumors of a satanic plot in the
recording industry, no less, in which various albums conceal
""backward-masked"" demonic murmurings. If THAT sounds too spacey to
be taken seriously, consider that it was the fundamentalist groups
who were behind House Resolution 6363, a bill introduced in the
U.S. House of Representatives by Robert K. Dornan (R., Calif.) in
1982 to label all suspect records: ""WARNING: THIS RECORD CONTAINS
BACKWARD MASKING THAT MAKES A VERBAL STATEMENT WHICH IS AUDIBLE
WHEN THIS RECORD IS PLAYED BACKWARD AND WHICH MAY BE PERCEPTIBLE
AT A SUBLIMINAL LEVEL WHEN THIS RECORD IS PLAYED FORWARD."" In
February 1983, the Arkansas State Senate passed a similar record-
labeling bill by a vote of 86 to 0.
     Contributing to the quasi-occult status of these rumors is
the difficulty of checking them out on home audio equipment. You
pretty much have to take someone else's word for it, or dismiss
the rumors out of hand.
     From a technical standpoint, there are four simple ways to
conceal a verbal message on a recording. The most obvious is to
record the message at a very low volume. The message may then be
recovered by turning the volume up while playing the record or
tape. If the message is faint enough, though, noise levels of home
equipment may garble it. If the accompanying music or lyrics are
loud enough, or if the message itself is indistinct or
electronically modified, it may be hard to hear on any equipment.
     A second gimmick is to record a message on one stereo track
only. Records and tapes have two independent recordings, of
course, normally played simultaneously for stereo effect. On a
record, each stereo track occupies on one side of the V-shaped
groove for the needle. On a tape, the tracks are recorded in
parallel lanes of the magnetic material. The two tracks are called
""right"" and ""left"" after the stereo speakers they will play on.
Otherwise, the tracks are interchangeable -- the sound mixer can
put anything he or she wants on each track. A message on one track
can be masked by simultaneous loud music or lyrics on the opposite
track. With normal stereo balance (or mono equipment) the loud
track drowns out the message track. At home, single-track messages
can be recovered by adjusting the stereo balance so that only the
desired track plays. Sometimes this trick also makes indistinct
words clearer. Even if the words are not exclusively on one track,
they may happen to be more audible on one track.
     A message could be recorded at a speed different from the
rest of the record. Then the record would have to be played faster
or slower than usual to recover the message. Unless the message
was at one of the standard speeds (say, 45 rpm on a 33 1/3 rpm
record), it could not be played normally on home equipment.
     The fourth and most commonly alleged trick is to record a
verbal message backward. Reversed speech has several unexpected
features. One is that syllables are not a constant in the reversal
process. A one-syllable word can have two or three syllables when
played backward. Thus ""number nine"" in the Beatles' REVOLUTION 9
reverses to ""Turn me on, dead man"" (or something like it), a jump
from three to five syllables.
     There is no simple way to predict what a word or phrase will
sound like reversed. Obviously, you can't just reverse the
letters.
     Reversed messages are difficult to recover at home. Record
turntables are not built to go backwards. Some have a neutral
setting, in which the pickup and amplifier remain active and you
can turn the record backward by hand. But hardly anyone has a
stead enough hand to produce satisfactory results.
     With patience, it is possible to reverse a cassette
recording. Transfer the music from the original record or tape
onto a blank tape cassette. Place the cassette flat on a table.
Draw our the part of the tape with the suspected message and snip
it off at both ends. Hold the tape segment horizontally. Rotate it
180 degrees, keep it horizontal at all times. This turns the tape
end for end. Splice the reversed tape segment back onto the two
loose ends of the cassette with strong adhesive tape. Reel the
tape back inside the cassette. The sliced segment will play
backward on an ordinary cassette player.
     I rented a recording studio to test the secret-message
rumors. New copiies of the records in question were transcribed on
a quarter-inch master tape. Where rumor alleged that a single
stereo track contained a message, right and left stereo tracks
were transcribed separately. Records with alleged inaudible
messages were treated similarly. To test claims of reversed
messages, recordings on the master tape were edited out and
spliced in backward. Twenty cuts or portions of cuts from sixteen
albums were tested.


""Another One Bites the Dust""
Queen, THE GAME

Rumor: When played backward, the lyrics say, ""It's fun to smoke
marijuana.""
Findings: There is something that sounds like ""It's fun to smoke
marijuana"" in the reversed music. It is repeated over and over. It
might be rendered no less faithfully, however, as ""sfun to scout
mare wanna."" This ""message"" is the reversal of the song title,
which is repeated as a line in the song.
     Let's make a distinction between engineered and phonetic
reversals. When an artist records a verbal statement, reverses it
by turning the tape end for end, mixes the reversed statement onto
a master tape, and has records and tapes produced from the master,
that is an engineered reversal. When the phonetic properties of
song lyrics are such that they can be reversed to sound like
something else, that is a phonetic reversal.
     ""It's fun to smoke marijuna"" is clearly a phonetic reversal.
The lyrics are perfectly plain played forward (""Another one bites
the dust""), no so plain played backward (""sfun to scout mare
wanna""). With an engineered reversal, the opposite should hold
true: gibberish forward, clear as a bell backward. Some are
prepared to believe that phonetic reversals are just as
intentional as engineered reversals -- that the songwriter
painstakinginly planned the phonetic double-entendre. In the
absence of confirming evidence, that just doesn't wash. It's too
easy to find coincidences. If, for example, the letters of the
alphabet are recited in conventional fashion (Ay, Bee, Cee, etc.)
and reversed, at least five sound like English language words. D
reverses to ""eden,"" F becomes ""pray,"" S becomes ""say,"" V becomes
""even,"" and Z becomes ""easy."" ""It's fun to smoke marijuana"" is
likewise a coincidence.


""A Child is Coming""
Jefferson Starship, BLOWS AGAINST THE EMPIRE

Rumor: When played backward, ""son of Satan.""
Findings: Another phonetic coincidence. The repeated ""It's getting
better"" reverses to an iffy ""son of Satan,"" the ""of"" drawn out and
the ""Satan"" strongly accented on the first syllable.


""Eldorado""
Electric Light Orchestra, ELDORADO

Rumor: When played backward, ""He is the nasty one/ Christ, you're
infernal/ It is said we're dead men/ Everyone who has the mark
will live.""
Findings: Coincidence. The supposed message lurks around the line
""On a voyage of no return to see."" Reversed, this passage becomes
the expected syllable salad -- no one hearing it would describe it
as anything but reversed music. Only if you listen while reading
along with what you're supposed to hear will you get anything. The
rumored version of the message is somewhat fudged. The passage
sounds more like ""He's to nasty one/ Christ you are, Christ,
you're fernal/ There wiss uh, we're dead men..."" There is no ""in""
in what is taken to be ""infernal."" The line that is supposed to be
""Everyone who has the mark will live"" isn't even close, though the
syllable count is right.


""Shoo Be Doo""
The Cars, CANDY-O

Rumor: When played backward, the word ""Satan"" repeated
approximately eleven times.
Findings: Coincidence. The rumor refers to the reversal of the ""Shoo
be doo, shoo be doo, shoo be doo..."" near the end of the song. Given
the mysterious logic of reversed phonemes, these three-syllable units
can be hard as a repeated two-syllable word. The word sounds a little
like ""Satan.""


""Snowblind""
Styx, PARADISE THEATER

Rumor: According to a mimeographed list of suspect records distributed
by Congressman Dornan, the words ""Satan move through our voices"" when
played backwards.
Findings: Negative. Despite repeated listenings, it was not even
possible to identify the part of the reversed track that Dornan et al.
are talking about.


""Stairway to Heaven""
Led Zeppelin, untitled, a.k.a. STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN

Rumor: In reverse, ""I live for Satan... The Lord turns me off...
There's no escaping it... Here's to my sweet Satan... There's power in
Satan... He will give you 666.""
Findings: Coincidence. If you listen very carefully to the ""And it
makes me wonder"" lines in reverse, you'll hear something approaching
""There's no escaping it."" A better description is ""There's no escape
do."" Knock of the last syllable, and you have ""There's no escape,"" a
complete, intelligible sentence in reverse. It's there, all right, but
it's not an unlikely enough coincidence to -- well, make you wonder.
      The ""Satan"" in ""I live for Satan"" is good and clear. The ""I live
for"" part isn't. The other alleged lines are unremarkable. All are
phonetic reversals of the entirely lucid forward lyrics and obviously
just accidents.


""When Electricity Came to Arkansas""
Black Oak Arkansas, BLACK OAK ARKANSAS and RONCH AND ROLL

Rumor: In reverse, ""Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan. He is God. He
is God.""
Findings: The BLACK OAK ARKANSAS cut was reversed. Again, pairs of
reversed syllables are being freely interpreted as ""Satan."" ""He is
God"" was not identifiable.


""Rain""
The Beatles, HEY JUDE

Rumor: Unintelligible lyrics at the end are reversed.
Findings: A true engineered reversal and not really a secret. ""Rain""
seems to have been the first popular recording to incorporate an
obviously reversed lyric. The story is that John Lennon accidentally
spliced the last part of the song in backward and liked the effect.
When reversed, the strange-sounding vocals at the end become
intelligible as a reprise starting with the drawn-out word
""sunshine.""
      The reversal is less apparent to the casual listener than it
might be because the accompanying music is not reversed. The ending
fits in smoothly with the rest of the song, the vocals suggesting a
foreign language.


""Fire on High""
Electric Light Orchestra, FACE THE MUSIC

Rumor: When played backward, ""The music is reversible, but time --
turn back!""
Findings: ""Fire on High"" is instrumental. About twenty-six seconds
into the music, scrambled speech is heard. It is mostly louder than
the accompanying music and begins with a two-syllable unit repeated
several times. The seeming speech lasts for about fourteen seconds.
      Reversing the music confirms that there is a true, engineered
message. In reverse, a voice (Jeff Lynne's?) says, ""The music is
reversible, but time -- turn back! Turn back! Turn back! Turn back!""
All the words are clear and unambiguous. Anyone comparing this to the
alleged reversal on ELO's ""Eldorado"" will have no trouble telling
which is genuine.


""Goodbye Blue Sky""
Pink Floyd, THE WALL

Rumor: In reverse, ""You have discovered the secret message.""
Findings: The ""secret message"" is at the very end of the instrumental
passage following the ""Goodbye Blue Sky"" vocals. It comes just before
the words ""What shall we do"" at the start of the song that is
identified as ""Empty Spaces"" on the record label and as ""What shall we
do now?"" on the record sleeve. Played forward, the message is less
apparent than the FACE THE MUSIC reversal: A reasonably attentive
listener might play THE WALL through and not catch it. It suggests
speech not quite close enough to be overheard. In context this is not
unusual because the ""Goodbye Blue Sky"" instrumental passage includes
""airport noises"" and other sound effects. A loud climax in the music
further masks the unintelligible voice.
      When played backward, the voice (Roger Waters?) plainly intones,
""Congratulations, you have just discovered the secret message. Please
send your answer to old Pink, care of the funny farm..."" As the voice
fades out, there may be another word -- perhaps ""Chalfonte or
""Chelsea"" -- after ""funny farm.""


""Heavy Metal Poisoning""
Styx, KILROY WAS HERE

Rumor: A red sticker on the KILROY WAS HERE cover warns, ""By order of
the Majority for Musical Morality, this album contains secret backward
messages...""
Findings: This is a case of second-generation backward-masking. Styx'
PARADISE THEATER did not contain a backward message, though a lot of
people said it did. So Styx has included a sure enough backward
message on KILROY WAS HERE. It is at the very beginning of ""Heavy
Metal Poisoning."" The reversed speech last about three seconds. There
is no musical background. The words reverse to ""Annuit coeptis. Novus
ordo seclorum."" This is the Latin motto encircling the pyramid on the
back of a dollar bill. The usual translation: ""God has favored our
undertakings. A new order of the ages.""
      The cover sticker's ""Majority for Musical Morality"" is a
fictitious Falwellesque group in the KILROY WAS HERE video. Although
the sticker suggests a plurality of ""messages,"" only one was found.


Space between ""I'm So Tired"" and ""Blackbird""
The Beatles, untitled, a.k.a. THE WHITE ALBUM

Rumor: A reversed message. At the time of the Paul-is-dead stories,
the segue from ""I'm So Tired"" to ""Blackbird"" was offered as evidence.
It was held to contain John Lennon's voice, reveresed, saying ""Paul is
dead, miss him, miss him, miss him."" That interpretation seems
unlikely now, but there is a mysterious low muttering between the
songs.
Findings: The mumbling is actually just to the ""I'm So Tired"" side of
the shiny ""space"" between cuts on the record. Each of the stereo
tracks was recorded separately, twice, and a copy of each track was
reversed. This produced four versions of the two-second passage: right
forward, left forward, right reversed, and left reversed. All were
equally unintelligible. It was not even apparent whether the voice is
forward or reversed. Nor could John Lennon be identified as the
speaker. There are nine or ten syllables. The first six (when played
forward) are a two-syllable unit repeated three times. There is little
or no difference betwen the stereo tracks. Any claimed interpretation
of the sounds seems doubtful.


""Strawberry Fields Forever""
The Beatles, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR

Rumor: It was, of course, claimed that John Lennon says ""I buried
Paul"" at the end. (It's forward, at the very end after the music
fades to complete silence, returns, and starts to fade out again.)
But Lennon told ROLLING STONE that the words are ""cranberry
sauce.""
Findings: They are ""cranberry sauce."" The ""sauce""/""Paul"" part is
indistinct, but the first syllable sounds a lot more like ""cran""
than ""I.""


""Baby You're a Rich Man""
The Beatles, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR

Rumor: On one of the tracks the line ""Baby you're a rich man too""
is sung as ""Baby you're a rich fag Jew,"" a dig at Brian Epstein.
Or some think it's ""rich fat Jew"" and claim it as evidence of
Beatle anti-Semitism.
Findings: Negative. The two stereo tracks are nearly identical.
It's always possible to hear words as similar-sounding words, but
basically, the lyrics jibe with the published version.


""Revolution 9""
The Beatles, untitled, a.k.a. THE WHITE ALBUM

Rumor: Various reversed and/or one-track speech. The reversal of
""Number nine"" to ""Turn me on, dead man"" has pretty much been
discounted as coincidence (though it appears on Congressman
Dornan's list).
Findings: Distinction between lyrics and any hidden message blurs
on ""Revolution 9."" The eight-minute cut is a montage of sounds
collected by John Lennon and Yoko Ono. It includes discordant
music, radio broadcasts, sirens, applause, gunfights, sports
cheers, the crackling of a fire, screams, a baby gurgling, a choir
singing, and much that cannot be identified. For this
investigation, ""Revolution 9"" was transcribed four times, twice on
each stereo channel. One copy of each of the tracks was reversed.
The four resulting versions were compared with each other and
against the original two-channel version.
     ""Revolution 9"" contains a lot of talking. Played in stereo,
forward, the longest stretch of understandable speech is probably
an announcer saying, ""...every one of them knew that as time went
by they'd get a little bit older and a little bit slower...""
     One believable instance of reversed speech occurs: someone
saying ""Let me out! Let me out!"" (once held to represent McCartney
in his totaled Aston-Martin). Two iffy reversals occur on the
backward recording of the right stereo track:""She used to be
assistant"" and ""There were two men..."" Neither is clear enough or
long enough to be convincing. Some of the music, including the
recurring theme, sounds more natural in reverse.
     ""Turn me on, dead man"" is a typical phonetic reversal. The
forward ""number nine"" (repeated throughout the cut) is clear; the
reversal is slurred -- something like ""turn me on dedmun."" It has
been claimed that ""number nine"" must be pronounced with a British
accent or with some careful inflection in order to reverse to
""Turn me on, dead man."" This seems not to be so. As an experiment,
three American-accent renderings of ""number nine"" were reversed.
All sound about as much like ""Turn me on, dead man"" as the record
did. Like the other phonetic reversals, ""Turn me on, dead man""
must be considered a coincidence.
     Much of ""Revolution 9"" is on one stereo track only. Near the
end a voice says ""A fine natural imbalance...the Watusi...the
twist...Eldorado...Eldorado."" ""A fine natural imbalance"" is on the
right track only, though the words that follow are in stereo. One
of the longer bits of speech -- ""Who could tell what he was
saying? His voice was low and his [unintelligible] was high and
his eyes were low"" -- is clear on the left track, a bare whisper
on the right.
     There is a stereophonically concealed ""secret message"" on
""Revolution 9."" The words are on the right track. They begin about
four minutes, fifty-eight seconds into the cut and run for about
twenty-two seconds. They are not likely to be noticed in stereo
because of the much louder left track. The sound of applause
begins on the left track at about five minutes, one second into
the cut. Deafening noises -- the clapping, sirens, music --
continue on the left track until five minutes, forty seconds. It
may or may not have been Lennon's and Ono's intention to conceal
the spoken passage. Given the haphazard quality of ""Revolution 9,""
the concealment may have been accidental. To recover the passage,
the left track must be switched off. The right track can then be
heard to contain a sound like a stopwatch ticking, behind these
words:

     So the wife called, and we better go to see a
     surgeon....[A SCREAM MUFFLES A LINE THAT SOUNDS LIKE
     Well, what with the prices, the prices have snowballed,
     no wonder it's closed.] ...So any and all, we went to
     see the dentist instead, who gave him a pair of teeth,
     which wasn't any good at all. So instead of that he
     joined the bloody navy and went to sea.
                      by William Poundstone
                              1986

     There really are backward messages on rock albums. And the
controversy over ""backward masking"" and ""porn rock"" has inspired a
whole new spate of messages. There may have been more genuine
backward messages in the past few years than ever before.
     The backward message controversy is usually traced to the
1960s and John Lennon's avant-garde sound mixing on such tracks as
""Revolution 9"" on the Beatles' WHITE ALBUM. Lennon probably wasn't
trying to conceal a message so much as create an interesting
sound.
     The matter might have ended right there had it not been for
the Paul McCartney death rumor. College kids tried playing Beatles
records forward, backward, and at various speeds to find ""clues""
to McCartney's fate. In the process they found snippets of speech
from Lennon's experiments. Even after McCartney was found safe and
sound in Scotland, some listeners continued to look for hidden
messages.
     Somehow, fundamentalist Christian groups became convinced
(ca. 1982) that the alleged messages were commercials for devil
worship. Not a single indisputable satanic message has turned up,
but there were scattered attempts to ban or label certain albums.
In 1986 one fundamentalist group announced that the theme song for
the old MR. ED TV show contains the word ""Satan"" when played
backward.)
     Ironically, the publicity accorded nonexistent messages has
inspired several artists -- among them porn rock hearing witness
Frank Zappa -- to hide real background messages in their music.
It's easy to do.
     The performer speaks or sings the message normally, then
reverses the tape, which is mixed into the soundtrack. This is all
accomplished simply enough at any recording studio.
     What's not so simple is playing it back. More home record,
cassette, and compact disk players won't play backward. You can
turn a record backward with a pencil eraser, but it's not good for
the needle or the turntable. The only way to reproduce the message
with full fidelity is to use a professional-quality reel-to-reel
tape player and splice the tape in backward.
     We used the facilities of KLOS radio in Los Angeles to
reverse some recent records containing true backward messages.


""Secret Messages""
Electric Light Orchestra, SECRET MESSAGES

ELO's ELDORADO album was among those alleged to contain satanic
backward masked messages. A patient listening to ELDORADO played
backward reveals no such messages. You hear only what you ought to
hear -- the reversed lyrics of the songs, which sound nothing like
the ""messages"" claimed to be there. In the wake of such
allegations, ELO did put an (innocuous) backward message on their
FACE THE MUSIC album. Perhaps they thought this would show how
silly the allegations were. Instead, the backward-masking people
seized on this as proof that the other ""messages"" were real. In
the latest volley, ELO has named an album after the controversy.
     In Britain (where the backward-masking issue is viewed as an
American eccentricity), the cover of SECRET MESSAGES has a mock
warning label to youth about the hidden label. Word of the albums'
impending release in the United States caused enough of a furor to
chill CBS Records into deleting the cover blurb.
     The reversed message is easy to find. It's at the beginning
of the first song, which is itself called ""Secret Messages."" You
can hear reversed speech when you play the record normally. A
voice intones ""secret messages"" -- forward -- in the middle of the
reversed speech, lest anyone dare be so unhip as to not know
what's going on.
     We transferred a new copy of SECRET MESSAGES to reel-to-reel
tapes and played it backward. The backward message goes: ""WELCOME
TO THE BIG SHOW/ WELCOME TO THE BIG SHOW.""
     That's it.


""Ya Hozna""
Frank Zappa, THEM OR US

""Ya Hozna,"" a six-minute composition on the first record of the
THEM OR US double album, is ENTIRELY backward. The albums' inner
cover, which includes lyrics for the other songs, says, ""backwards
vocal -- you figure it out"" of this cut. It credits Frank and Moon
Zappa, George Duke, and Napoleon Murphy Brock as vocalists.
     Played forward, ""Ya Howza"" sounds like a record played
backward -- reasonably so. The vocals are prominent and
unintelligible. Moon Zappa's voice is curiously recognizable, even
in reverse. It is hard to tell whether the music was recorded
forward or backward.
     When ""Ya Howza"" is played in reverse, you discover that the
music is virtually a palindrome -- it sounds about the same
forward and backward. The voices are all backward. In some cases
they have been modified electronically. Many of the words are
muffled. Even after repeated careful listening on both stereo
tracks, it is difficult to make out many of the lyrics. It doesn't
help that some of the words seem to be stream-of-consciousness
nonsense. Some of the unintelligible stuff sounds like opera.
     Starting at the beginning of the reversed tape -- the end of
the forward tape -- the clearer vocals go like this: ""I am the
heaven, I am the water."" This is in a hymnlike register. ""You are
a lonely little girl./ But your mommy and your daddy hold you."" A
singsong synthesizer voice.
     The most interesting part of the lyrics is an intermittently
orgasmic rap in Moon Zappa's Valley Girl voice. There are three
short monologues:

I'm like green!
I'm like squat!
I'm like soul!
Repeat, like soul!
I'm like pull, push,
Okay, like slow, slow.

You're never too old
Like slow, like slow, like slow
Okay, I like it.


All right, faster, faster,
Go, do it, do it twice,
Yeah, that feels good,
I'm looking great,
Yeah, fer shure!
Like, no way!


""No Anchovies, Please""
J. Geils Band, LOVE STINKS

""No Anchovies, Please"" is a novelty song, really a narration with
sound effects, about a woman who is kidnapped after eating
anchovies. She is taken to a ""foreign-speaking"" country. The sound
effect of the foreign tongue seems reversed. When you do play it
in reverse, it becomes: ""It doesn't take a genius to know the
difference between chicken shit and chicken salad.""


""Darling Nikki""
Prince, PURPLE RAIN

""Darling Nikki,"" cited as porn rock before Congress, is about a
dominatrix in a hotel lobby masturbating with a magazine. In part,
the complaint was that the album cover (flowers, and Prince on a
motorcycle) wasn't explicit enough to warn kids of the suggestive
lyrics. Senator Paula Hawkins apparently was not aware of a
backward message hidden in ""Darling Nikki."" The last thirty-five
seconds of the song is gibberish. The music changes abruptly and
becomes a repeated glottal sound. Then a two-syllable sound is
repeated twice, something like ""heaven, heaven."" Unintelligible
speech follows. At the end is a sound reminiscent of rain or bacon
frying , and wind sounds.
     Played backward, the message becomes:

     Hello, how are you?
     I'm fine 'cause I know that the Lord is coming soon.
     Coming, coming soon.

     It is clearly Prince and the Revolution singing this. The
words are clear but the intonation is funny -- the linger on some
words. Perhaps this is to make the reversed message you hear
playing the record normally a little less conspicuous.
     This is a weird reversal of the supposed secret message
menace. Raunchy forward lyrics conceal a religious secret message.


""Judas Kiss""
Petra, MORE POWER TO YOU

Petra is an obscure group that sings religious songs to a rock
beat. As further proof that things have gone full circle, the
backward-masking controversy prompted Petra to include a wholesome
backward message on their MORE POWER TO YOU album. It is in the
transition between two songs, just before ""Judas Kiss."" Clearly
audible gibberish reverses to this (the husky voice a cross
between George Beverly Shea and Dee Snider): ""What are you looking
for the Devil for, when you ought to be looking for the Lord?""

AFL JoyceM Welcome to the Apple II Music & Sound chat - our discussion will
           be on NoiseTracker - the new FTA music program for the GS.  AFA
           Gene will be our host this evening...Gene, the floor is yours :)

AFA Gene   Hi all... well first I'd like to point out, if y'all aren't aware
           yet, that a spanking new version of NoiseTracker has recently
           been released (9 days ago) and is now available in our New Files
           library. It is version 0.5. I haven't played around with it much
           yet, but it's supposed to fix a lot of the little bugs in 0.3
           (the first version we had online).  NoiseTracker also includes
           the ability to directly import ""modules,"" a term used for a
           certain type of Amiga song file which has become popular among PC
           users using the SoundBlaster sound card.

           Now, via NT, these ""MOD"" files are accessible by the GS. We
           expect to see a lot of activity on this end as far as ports from
           the PC and Amiga go. Note that you should be able to go straight
           to the PC music forum and download any recently uploaded MOD
           songfiles (there was a bug in the first wide release of the PCAO
           software, however, so a bunch of files with dates between around
           March 1991 and September 1991 may not download properly. Note that
           to use these PC MOD files, you'll have to rename the downloaded
           file ""MOD.xxxxxx"" if you want it to show up automatically in NT's
           ""open"" dialog box. (On the PC, all MOD files are named
           ""xxxxxxxx.MOD"" instead.)   Also, if the files are packed with ZIP
           compression, you'll need a program from the Communications Forum
           called AGATE -- it's a terminal program that includes the ability
           to unpack ZIP files.

           Now, I guess the best thing to do would be to talk about our
           favorite songfiles... there have been a few complaints, in fact,
           that people were not being ""descriptive"" enough in their file
           descriptions for uploads in describing the songs.

AFC Eddie  ?

AFA Gene   GA ed

AFC Eddie  Once a MOD file is unpacked with Agate, is a file type change
           needed?

AFA Gene   Nope, since all that NT looks for is the ""MOD."" being the first
           four characters in the filename.

AFC Eddie  OK, Thanks!

Deanna7332 Question...

JonL7      Can you list some of the features of Noisetracker?

AFA Gene   (you don't even need that ""MOD."" if you want to type the name in
           directly.)

Deanna7332 Did any of these mod files have anything to do with FTA's ""Module
           A""

AFA Gene   Sure Jon, right after we answer Deanna's question. Deanna, you
           mean ""Modulae?""

Deanna7332 Yes, that's it.

AFA Gene   Modulae was a demo written by FTA last year. (i'll get to you in a
           sec Doors).  It used SoundSmith v0.95 for all it's music. There
           is no connection between MOD files and Modulae by FTA.

Deanna7332 Throughout the demo it said ""Loading modules""

AFA Gene   Those ""modules"" are not the same as Amiga soundfile ""modules"" --
           you see, what Modulae really was was a ""stringing together"" of a
           bunch of neat little tiny demos that FTA had written. So they
           called each little demo a ""module"" and thus the entire demo as a
           whole, ""Modulae"" (fancy plural of module?)

Deanna7332 Ok I understand.  Thank you. :)

AFL JoyceM Latin, Gene :)

AFA Gene   The term ""MODule"" from the Amiga comes from the idea that all the
           stuff needed to play the songfile (all the instruments + the
           sequence file) are included into one file, the ""module.""

TheDoors1  Gene, I have tried to d/l some recent uploaded MODs in the PC
           music area and still the problem exists.

AFA Gene   As I understand it, the problem was fixed VERY recently (correct
           me on this Joyce) and files uploaded as recently as early
           November still might not work depending on the version of the
           PCAO software that the uploader used.

AFL JoyceM Actually, Gene...I was under the impression that it had been, but
           if Doors is still having a problem, then it must not be fixed.

AFA Gene   What date was the file you tried to d/l, Door?

TheDoors1  umm 11/17, around there

AFA Gene   hmmm.... well i can tell you one thing... if it didn't work, don't
           waste your time again later... the problem is in the Apple
           software's method of d/lling files, and there are no plans to
           upgrade the Apple AO software.

AFL JoyceM I will endeavor to get an answer to that PC downloading
           problem/question :)

ThomasK63  i have a quick question... what can you use to unpack amiga mod
           files? On the PC side, that is.

TheDoors1  Agate Thomas

ELECTMUSIC Doors... what happens on after downloading..

Deanna7332 If it's LZHed you can't unless you have an IBM or
           PC/Transporter.

AFA Gene   If GS-ShrinkIt doesn't have that ability, i don't think there
           exists any such utility on the GS.

TheDoors1  What do you mean Elect?

ELECTMUSIC After you download the file... where do you encounter a problem?

TheDoors1  ok, you know when you download the file and at some point in the
           download the file starts to appear on your screen.  That's when I
           cancel it.

ThomasK63  I am sure soething good can be made w/out resorting to Amiga
           files

AFC Eddie  Yes, Doors, I believe the problem is with the PC software it was
           UL'd with.

TheDoors1  yeah Eddie.

GNO Tim    Amiga MOD files are typically compressed using LHarc.  I've
           uncompressed several on my Unix machine at school.

ThomasK63  good time for someone to make a lharc unpacker...

AFC DYAJim someone might be ;)

GNO Tim    Several people are already

AFC Eddie  Can't wait, Jim!

AFA Gene   Jon, did you have a question?

JonL7      The features of Noisetracker :)

AFA Gene   Oh yes... okay, here goes, in a nutshell, from most important to
           least:


AFA Gene   *  ability to import MOD files

           *  ability to import Soundsmith files

           *  ProDOS 8 based

           *  virtually no editing abilities (not a feature but important to
           know)

AFC DYAJim :)

AFA Gene   *  forgot: and the most important feature of all, the ability to
           hold instrument files in regular system RAM instead of DOC RAM,
           allowing for instruments far beyond the regular 64K limit found
           in ALL other GS music programs.

ThomasK63  I'll buy that!

TheDoors1  I have another question...when you're ready.

AFA Gene   GA Doors

TheDoors1  ok..is it true that NoiseTracker will take in soundsmith files and
           play them more clearly

AFA Gene   Well, as far as ""what you hear,"" yes there is a definite
           difference with some instruments. It does NOT play the sounds
           more ""clearly,"" but it just plays them in a different way. What
           many people seem to like about this ""different way"" is that
           sustained instruments (i.e. instruments designed to be played
           in a loop to simulate a long held note) seem to work better (or
           perhaps simply the way they were originally intended to work).

TheDoors1  I see

Deanna7332 Which takes up more space - MOD or NT  w/soundfile ?

AFA Gene   Deanna, it depends a few things, such as how big the sequence is,
           how many instruments you have, etc. Once you have a lot of
           assorted files, it'll probably average out to be about the same
           give or take a hundred blocks on your HD. So it basically depends
           on whether you prefer to have your instruments separate or not.

Deanna7332 Does playing quality differ with either one ?

AFA Gene   Nope. It's exactly the same either way. Loading time is the same
           too.

AFC Eddie  Can NT save songs as MOD files?

AFA Gene   Nope. It has options for Open and Close module, but these are
           still inactive.

AFA Gene   If there are no more questions, I'd like to talk about which NT
           files out there are the ""hottest,"" since this info could be
           useful to many users who are interested in downloading NT/MOD
           files.

           My personal favorite is ""Lambada,"" which is supplied by FTA with
           the program but is available separately on America
           Online.Everything about this file is really impressive except
           perhaps the sound quality of the horn-ish melody instrument.

           What about y'all, what are your favorite NT files?

AFL JoyceM Gene, there is a classical song for NT, but can't remember the
           name, but it is good.

AFC Eddie  I like Dragnet!

ELECTMUSIC So do I Ed

TheDoors1  I like Seven something

Deanna7332 My most favorite of all mod files is Pleasure Principle

AFC Eddie  <--appreciate's Greg's taste!

AFL JoyceM :)

AFA Gene   Deanna, i assume you got that from a local board?

Deanna7332 I got it from the PC forum here.

TheDoors1  I saw it there also

Deanna7332 I think under ""Pleasure""

AFA Gene   Would you be able to upload it here? If it's really that good, we
           ought to have it available directly in our oun NT lib here (BTW
           folks, we will be releasing a new NoiseTracker software library
           soon!)

AFC Eddie  What a Forum!!!

Deanna7332 That sounds great!

AFL JoyceM Gene, do you think it will be possible for synthLAB files to be
           converted to MOD files?

AFL JoyceM MOD files?

AFA Gene   I doubt it, Joyce. The formats are so diametrically opposed in
           their entire basis of their file formats that it wouldn't be
           worth the time for a programmer to develop such a convertor.

Deanna7332 Isn't it possible to move the mod file from the PC forum to our
           music library?

AFA Gene   But..... it might be worth the time for a MIDI File Format to MOD
           convertor, since these two formats are more widely accepted.

Nuzz       they have nothing better to do Gene

ELECTMUSIC Gene.. some interesting similarities with DTune and NTracker

AFA Gene   They lose the file, tho, Deanna. :)

AFL JoyceM In what way, Greg?

ELECTMUSIC Both Prodos 8

Deanna7332 Shhh they won't know a thing :)

ELECTMUSIC I also believe Bill uses a shuttling of sound data between Doc
           Ram and Ram.

AFC Eddie  Interesting, Greg.

ELECTMUSIC Thats how he gets some of the excellent instrument quality

AFC Eddie  But Diversitune has that one distinction:  MIDI input.

AFL JoyceM Deanna, we would greatly appreciate it if you would upload that
           'Pleasure' song to our library :)

ELECTMUSIC Agreed Ed.. one of the factors FTA doesn't like to incorporate
           into their programs.

Deanna7332 I'll u/l it tonight if possible.

AFL JoyceM Thanks :)

AFC Eddie  Thanks, Deanna!

AFL JoyceM I will send Bill B a copy of NoiseTracker + some MOD files...to
           see what comments we get from him (will send when I get back).

AFC DYAJim What ever happened to that diversitune upgrade that was talked
           about ?

ELECTMUSIC That would be interesting Joyce

AFC Eddie  Bill apparently still working on it, Jim.

ELECTMUSIC I am sure he would appreciate the Prodos 8

AFC DYAJim good..

AFL JoyceM Jim...RSN....he was hoping by Christmas (this year), but he is
           soooo busy with his job, who knows?

AFC DYAJim Oh yeah, I noticed the speed calcuation in NT .5 is inaccurate
           :)

AFC DYAJim I recall he has set a lot of Christmas projected dates :)

ELECTMUSIC He was one of the first ""Free Tools"" experts in breaking all the
           rules for economic sake.

AFC DYAJim like for the vaporware DT inst editor like 2 years ago.

Deanna7332 Are there any Christmas Mod or NT songs?

AFC Eddie  Oh yeah, Diversi-Editor!

AFL JoyceM I know, Jim - but that I know he has been working on.

AFC DYAJim he projected Christmas for it, and it never came :)

AFA Gene   Not yet in AMS, but hopefully the Holiday Contest will change all
           that. :)

AFC DYAJim I look foreward to any upgrades..

AFL JoyceM Not that I am aware of Deanna - you have some?  hint, hint

Deanna7332 Nope sorry.  I was hoping there were some that could be u/led
           here

AFC DYAJim I'll be breaking out the xmas tune book rsn.. I should be able to
           midi a few :) (which rules out nt)

AFL JoyceM Question...

AFC Eddie  It would be more appropriate to have a converter from Appleworks
           spreadsheet to MOD than from MIDI!

AFL JoyceM If I got ahold of an Amiga song (MOD) disk...how would I convert
           them for here?

AFA Gene   You mean an Amiga-formatted disk?

AFL JoyceM Yes

AFC DYAJim Ack.. methinks you need an amiga and a null modem cable or a
           modem.

AFA Gene   Methinks Jim is right

AFC DYAJim LOL!!  Design your music in the spreadsheet then import to NT :)
           IT might actually have better editing?!! :)

AFC Eddie  Right!

AFL JoyceM Me thinks he is right.  If I had them upload to me, would that
           work?

AFA Gene   Yep; should work like a charm.

AFC DYAJim Yah.. as long as they're coming from an amiga

AFL JoyceM Great....I will work on that when I get back  (making note now).

AFL JoyceM Gene, will you get some of those files (NT) sent to that area
           tonight?  If so, I will leave the needed message :)

AFA Gene   That's all I have planned for tonight's chat, Joyce. Yep, I'll
           move some files right now.

AFL JoyceM Thanks...

AFL JoyceM Then we should have our NoiseTracker Library by end of the week in
           AMS :)

ELECTMUSIC Gene... quick question:  Are you launching NTracker from a 3.5
           disk?

AFL JoyceM Okay, guys...I will see you all the week of December 11th (may the
           4th) as I am off on vacation.

AFA Gene   Yep greg

AFC JohnC  Where are you going?

ELECTMUSIC Do you encounter out of memory problems

AFL JoyceM Night all...and Gene, thanks for an excellent chat and great
           explanations of NoiseTracker.

Nuzz       Joyce, I have good news for FutureSound owners. SoundConvert will
           support it in the first release

AFC Eddie  Great, Mike!

AFA Gene   Greg, i always keep my RAMdisk at 0 when using noisetracker. Not
           only are

AFC JohnC  Mike...SoundConvert...released?

AFL JoyceM Great, Mike.  When can we get SoundConvert, Mike? and FutureSound
           :)

AFA Gene   there a couple of bugs with memory management, but if you're
           loading in a MOD file that's really big, NT will eat your RAMdisk.

AFC Eddie  Sounds good.

Nuzz       The manual is being ""layout"". Release date should be about 1st
           week of Dec

ELECTMUSIC Tnxs Gene

AFC JohnC  YES.......WTG Nuzz!!!!!!!!

Deanna7332 Yes, why is there on some MOD files a stop somewhere in the middle
           ?

Deanna7332 That's really frustrating!

AFL JoyceM Mike, leave me E-Mail on when and how I can send your the $$ to
           get it.

AFL JoyceM Again...night all

Nuzz       gee John, I had to do something to explain the delay :)

ELECTMUSIC Thanks Gene for a GREAT chat!

AFC Eddie  Yes, Gene!  Great!

AFA Gene   Thanks Greg, 'night!

AFA Gene   thanx, see y'all later :)

Copyright 1987 Bob Szekely.

    John Michael Osbourne, (known as ""Ozzy"" to his fans), has in his long 
career as vocalist for Black Sabbath had his work with the group misconstrued 
as advocating Satanism.  In a 1983 radio special featuring Ozzy, the 
interviewer expressed precisely this point; ""...Ozzy has always been shrouded 
in the darkest of Satanic imagery.  Yet if you really listen to his music, 
you'll find that what he is saying differs greatly from his image....""(1)  Even 
the group's image has often been described as ""occult and diabolic"".(2)

    The important point to remember here is to differentiate between appearance 
and reality.  Although the name ""Black Sabbath"" conjures up images of witches 
and sorcerers paying homage to Satan for the powers bestowed upon them, this 
does not make it safe to assume that the group that went by this name 
necessarily drew the inspiration from the occult.(3)  The closest they ever 
came to it was a gothic horror film featuring Boris Karloff as narrator; they 
adopted their name directly from the name of this film.(4)  Black Sabbath was 
involved in the black arts as much as Karloff practiced casting spells off-
screen.  Tony Iommi, the group's guitarist, summed it up best when he described 
the group as having basically ""...the same appeal as a horror movie.  It's all 
an act.""(5)










    Just as their film counterpart did, Ozzy and Sabbath found the occult 
mythos to be an effective vehicle for powerful social commentary; particularly 
when put in the context of heavy-metal rock and roll.  Ozzy himself noted that 
there are ""...people who pick up my [album] cover[s] and go...'This guy's got 
to be singing about Devil, doom, death and destruction.'  Which is not the 
case....""(6)

    The late Lester Bangs likened the group to Bob Dylan and William Burroughs, 
describing them all as ""...moralists...trying to deal with a serious present 
situation in an honest way....""(7)  Ozzy and Black Sabbath merely bring to 
light the many evils of our world in their work, to try and make us realize 
that we are all victim to their influence.  They hope to make us recognize 
these evils so that we may take up arms against them; a point Ozzy emphatically 
stresses:  ""...one thing everybody has got to understand about Black Sabbath's 
lyrics.  They're not downer lyrics, they're just telling everybody where it's 
at...""(8)  He also cites the group's most controversial tune, ""Black Sabbath"", 
as a response to the ignorant hippie culture still force when the tune was 
written in 1970:  ""The hippies said: 'The world is beautiful man.' (sic)  You 
only had to look around you to see how crappy it was.  It was ridiculous 
listening to that stuff, let alone playing it, so we just wrote about the world 
the way it really was and how it affected us - and we felt better in ourselves 
because we were really being honest....""(9)

        31  WILL YOU BE SO SURE WHEN YOUR DAY IS NEAR
        32  SAY YOU DON'T BELIEVE?
        33  YOU HAD THE CHANCE BUT YOU TURNED IT DOWN
        34  NOW YOU CAN'T RETRIEVE.










    VI  35  PERHAPS YOU'LL THINK BEFORE YOU SAY THAT
        36  GOD IS DEAD AND GONE
        37  OPEN YOUR EYES, JUST REALIZE THAT HE IS THE
        38  ONE.
        39  THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN SAVE YOU KNOW FROM
        40  ALL THIS SIN AND HATE.
        41  OR WILL YOU STILL JEER AT ALL YOU HEAR?
        42  YES!-I THINK IT'S TOO LATE.

    In this piece, the group asserts a belief in an afterlife and spiritual 
redemption.  As grisly as the image of a hanged pontiff is, its shock value is 
a necessary part of the message:  They reject religious dogma, stating that a 
belief in God, in one's own heart, is the only guiding light to help one inn 
his life (lines 11/12, 39/40).  Furthermore, the reject religious hypocrisy 
(lines 5/6, 7/8) and peer pressure (verses III, IV) as excuses for not 
accepting God.  To clarify further:  following the crowd does not justify 
shrugging responsibility for one's own actions.

    After re-reading, it becomes obvious that this song is an ascerbic critique 
of atheism; (line 35/36) I refer here again to verses three and four.  In these 
two verses, the picture painted in one of Godless conformity and how it's 
viewed as being as foolish as Paganism.  These lyrics set an example for the 
listener by relating personal experience (lines 13-16).  However, for those who 
cannot accept this the group has no recourse but to condemn them, although 
rather ironically; they hope that their rhetorical loss of faith in the 
listener will open his eyes (line 42).

            WHAT IS THIS, THAT STANDS BEFORE ME?
            FIGURE IN BLACK, WHICH POINTS AT ME
            TURN ROUND QUICK AND START TO RUN
            FIND OUT I'M THE CHOSEN ONE.  OH, NO!
            
            BIG BLACK SHAPE WITH EYES OF FIRE
            TELLING PEOPLE THEIR DESIRE
            SATAN'S SITTING THERE, HE'S SMILING
            WATCHES THOSE FLAMES GET HIGHER AND HIGHER
            OH, NO, NO, -- PLEASE GOD HELP ME!
            
                IS THIS THE END MY FRIEND?
                SATAN'S COMING 'ROUND THE BEND
                PEOPLE RUNNING 'CAUSE THEY'RE SCARED
                THE PEOPLE BETTER GO AND BEWARE
                NO, NO!  PLEASE--NO!!
                
                
    The all time controversy winner!  Is this not irrefutably  THE song about 
Black Magic in rock?  It's all so obvious, suffuse with evil imagery; Satan, 
walls of flame, figure in black, and damnation at the end.  Yes, I see the 
images too; it definitely concerns Black Magic.  Then again, Shakespeare's 
Macbeth employed scenes of witches involved in conjurations; does that mean 
that Shakespeare was a warlock?  Poe used to write sardonic tragedies about 
twisted murderers and the bizarre nature of acts, did that make him an evil, 
leering, demented killer?  Did either of them advocated what they wrote about?  
One has to remember that writing about something is not necessarily the same as 
emulating it.  Tony Iommi spoke out quite strongly about this:  ""People are 
bringing us down saying that we are a Black Magic group.  I think they must be










getting mixed up with Black Widow.  We don't do any sacrifices on stage, and 
we're not on a black magic kick.  We wanted to do heavy numbers and the guitar 
riffs we worked out were more suited to evil things than love.  We play songs 
about black magic, but they are more likely to be against than for it.""(12)  

    By now, you're probably asking yourself who Black Widow is, right?  Then 
it's time for a little history:

        Sabbath, before they were known as Sabbath, had the same line-up but 
two earlier names.  The first one was Polka Tulk, which seemed sure to doom 
them to obscurity.(13)  The soon realized this and changed the group's name to 
Earth.  Now, Earth was a blues band at the end of the English blues boom.  As 
if that wasn't bad enough, they soon discovered that not only was there another 
group named Earth, but they had also released a single.  To avoid confusion, 
they changed their name again.(14)  But what made them decide on that name?  
Just ask Ozzy:  ""I just liked the name Black Sabbath because of the succession 
of vowel sounds.(15)  If that sounds ludicrous just consider this:  Sabbath was 
""...the first of the really committed, loud and heavy bands...""(16)  They 
needed a name to match the gut-wrenching power they were developing.  Tony knew 
that he wanted Sabbath to be noticed above all the rest of the British blues 
bands:  ""We wanted something of our own that we'd like and people would like.  
And we wanted something loud!""










    Tony didn't hate the blues.  He'd cut his teeth as a guitarist on the likes 
of The Shadows, Buddy Holly and Django Rheinhardt, developing his own style 
from there.  But he realized the group had no future in the blues:

        'We couldn't keep playing 12-bars forever.  We just got fed up with 
Earth music.  It was jazz, blues stuff.  It was good for practice but nothing 
else.'

    In the late 'Sixties, blues groups were a dime a dozen in Birmingham and 
interest was waning in the blues boom due to the glut of groups.  One man, by 
the name of Jim Simpson, had heard Earth around the Birmingham club circuit and 
understood what they were trying to do.  He decided to take them under his 
wing.  With the aid of his massive record collection, Jim expanded the group's 
horizons in the areas of jazz and blues.  He introduced them to artists like 
Wes Montgomery, Count Basie and Jimmy Rushing.  It was from Rushing in 
particular that they derived the repetitive riff style so readily noticeable in 
their later incarnation as Black Sabbath.

    The Count Basie influence is evidenced in the song ""Wicked World"" from the 
first album; Sabbath drummer Bill Ward uses a ""'sighing hi-hat'...in the manner 
of Basie's drummer Jo Jones.""










    The influence is subtle, almost subliminal.  Yet it is one which was not 
thought capable of hard, 'heavy' rock bands in the late 'Sixties.  Although Led 
Zeppelin and Jimi Hendrix also had their work steeped in blues and jazz 
derivations (Hendrix' ""Third Stone From the Sun"" and Zeppelin's version of 
Willie Dixon's ""I Can't Quit You Baby"" from their first album), neither was 
able to match the intense energy of Black Sabbath.  Iommi has always had a 
preference for music with an original, distinct style of its' own; as an 
example, he mentions guitarists Joe Pass and Alvin Lee as two of his strongest 
songwriting influences.

    It would also be necessary that Sabbath develop a unique, distinctive style 
and image of their own.  Though they had changed their name from Earth to Black 
Sabbath to avoid confusion with the other Earth; at the same time another group 
emerged by the name of Black Widow ""...who WERE profoundly influenced by the 
occult, had a male witch as a patron, and wrote pieces like ""Come to The 
Sabbat.""  Unfortunately, Sabbath was constantly reaping the benefits of Widow's 
publicity.

    Sabbath was a group that never minced words.  If they saw something as 
destructive, they would be sure to rub the listener's face it it.  They did not 
want their point to be missed.

    With their straightforward, sometimes brutal way of looking at things, they 
try to shock the listener's conscience back into awareness.  The imagery of 
""Hand of Doom"", from the Paranoid album, is candid and condemning; it is a 
strong statement against drug addiction and rightly so...

            IT'S TO LATE TOO TURN
            YOU DON'T WANNA LEARN
            PRICE OF LIFE YOU CRY
            NOW YOU'RE GONNA DIE
            
            
    Many people felt the group's overall direction was pessimistic and had a 
negative effect on its listener's due to that.  ""Ozzy insisted that if people 
thought he was having a bad effect on the minds of young kids, they should go 
and watch the TV news where real murder and mayhem were a way of life, and 
shown night after night."" (18)

    Sabbath was never negative in their message; they were simply truthful 
about waht they saw as wrong in the world.  If you ""Strip away the horror 
stories, the imagery and the hysteria, (and) turn down the amps a notch...you 
have a well-rehearsed, solid blues and rock band, powered by a dedication to 
well defined objectives.""  On the top of the list of those objectives was 
truth; Sabbath never feared facing that truth squarely, regardless of what many 
people thought of them.

Long, long, time ago,
I can still remember,
When the local calls were ""free"".
And I knew if I paid my bill,
And never wished them any ill,
That the phone company would let me be...

But Uncle Sam said he knew better,
Split 'em up, for all and ever!
We'll foster competition:
It's good capital-ism!

I can't remember if I cried,
When my phone bill first tripled in size.
But something touched me deep inside,
The day... Bell System... died.

And we were singing...

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

Is your office Step by Step,
Or have you gotten some Crossbar yet?
Everybody used to ask...
Oh, is TSPS coming soon?
IDDD will be a boon!
And, I hope to get a Touch-Tone phone, real soon...

The color phones are really neat,
And direct dialing can't be beat!
My area code is ""low"":
The prestige way to go!

Oh, they just raised phone booths to a dime!
Well, I suppose it's about time.
I remember how the payphones chimed,
The day... Bell System... died.

And we were singing...

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

Back then we were all at one rate,
Phone installs didn't cause debate,
About who'd put which wire where...
Installers came right out to you,
No ""phone stores"" with their ballyhoo,
And 411 was free, seemed very fair!

But FCC wanted it seems,
To let others skim long-distance creams,
No matter 'bout the locals,
They're mostly all just yokels!

And so one day it came to pass,
That the great Bell System did collapse,
In rubble now, we all do mass,
The day... Bell System... died.

So bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

I drove on out to Murray Hill,
To see Bell Labs, some time to kill,
But the sign there said the Labs were gone.
I went back to my old CO,
Where I'd had my phone lines, years ago,
But it was empty, dark, and ever so forlorn...

No relays pulsed,
No data crooned,
No MF tones did play their tunes,
There wasn't a word spoken,
All carrier paths were broken...

And so that's how it all occurred,
Microwave horns just nests for birds,
Everything became so absurd,
The day... Bell System... died.

So bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

We were singing:

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?

We will worship like the Druids,      Some guys have a circumcision

And she's good enough for me!              And that's good enough for me!

Whether Low Church or it's High Church    I have got a strange religion
Or it's Pie-Up-In-The-Sky Church          I will worship Walter Pidgeon
Come on down and visit my Church          Is he sacred? Just a smidgen!
Cause it's good enough for me!            But it's good enough for me!

Brother Jerry is a cretin             Brother Oral's in his tower,
But with all the cash he's gettin'    Trusting in the Lord's power
Lotsa folks'll be forgettin           Getting richer by the hour,
It's the ""Land of the Free!""          Now he's got the ransom fee!

Brother Robert's church is Crystal     Brother Earnest is a healer
But all the Bible that he's missed'll  And not QUITE a wheeler-dealer --
Make you ""hotter than a pistol""        More a jumper and a squealer
But he's good enough for me!           So he's good enough for me!

Brother Jim and Sister Tammy       Then there's good ol' Brother Billy
Had a show that was a whammy       Bringing souls in willy-nilly.

Tryin' t'get back on TV!           But he's good enough for me!

Let us read works of Confucius         We will worship Xipe-Totec

But it's good enough for me!       And thats good enough for me 

You could join Jehovah's Witness             
Running door to door for fitness
Well if you've been blessed with quickness,

We used to study old Confucius      And let's not forget Pelagius
As we sat there on our tushes       Though some call him outrageous
We're learning but don't push us    He is pious and courageous
And thats good enough for me        And he's good enough for me!

It's the opera written for us
We will all join in the chorus
It's the opera about Boris
Which is Godunov for me!

   As many a puissant Countess will assert!
   It makes you wonder about King Vissevald
   The King who wears a skirt!                            (16)

   Vissevald is King of the Eastland
   Drinks Imperium Compound by the quart
   He likes it so much he's never noticed
   We now wear daggers into Court!                        (16)

   Vissevald and his Lady Mara
   Danced ""La Volta"" through the night;
   He drank too deep of Imperium Compound,

   Gavin Kilkenny asked ""Is there any-

   Duke Sir Deaton, was never beaten
   On the field, or in the drinking hall;
   At the Catbox War with Caid,

   Denis O'Titans was good at smitin'

              To Lily the Pink, the Pink, the Pink,
              The savior of the human ra-aa-ace.
              She invented Imperium Compound,
              Most effacatious in evr'y case.

   There was Horic, We thought he was sick,
   As a War-Puppy he was insane,

   This song'll bedevil the folks at a revel,

   Going on a wartime shopping spree!  \\ War Point!\\
   Took a drink of Imperium Compound

   Lyn of Whitewolfe, made of the right stuff,

   Duke Sir Brion, and Duke Sir Trelon,

   Fredrick of Holland, who dwells in the Northland,

   Now Gyrth Oldcastle, round as a beer barrel,
   Once chose to quarrel with a certain Bard;
   The poet served him with Imperium Compound,

   Many tales abound of Imperium Compound
   And its' strange effects on Royalty,
   But after an hour, this song has no power,
   And by now, it's boring ME!                             (16)

   Duchess Malinda, who doesn't do windas
   But she does a lot of Duchess Things,
   But give her a LOT of Imperium Compound,
   And she sings and sings and sings and sings and sings!   (5)

   AltChorus: Oh it's too long, too long, too long
              To sing the whole song, the song, the song
              Longer than a Royal Court, it is!
              But sing it serial, this ditty Imperial
              And you'll be a bardic whiz!                 (5)

                                             IMPERIUM COMPOUND    
                                             (Atenveldt Verses)

   Now here's a story, a little bit gory,
   A little bit happy, a little bit sad.
   About a drink called Imperium Compound
   And how the SCA's been had!                       

   Chorus: Oh we think, we think, we think,
           The King is a fink, a fink, a fink,
           A figure of respectability
           Rules the Kingdom thru Imperium Compound
           The results are plain to see!

   Mongol Hordemen, those free-living swordsmen
   Subverting the Kingdoms from underneath!
   Have no use for Imperium Compound
   Except perhaps to brush their teeth!

   AltChorus: Oh we fink, we fink, we fink,
              The Khan and the Kink, the Kink, the Kink,
              And the Board, their Great Senilities!
              The Western Irgun, drinks Imperium Compound
              And we're BACK, with results you'll see!    

   Lady Laurel, with Authority Royal,
   Passes and rejects our heraldry
   She needs a swig of Imperium Compound
   Then perhaps she'd deign to talk to me!            

   Lady Trude thought it her duty
   To turn a social wrong into a Right
   Proved her point with Imperium Compound
   And showed that Cheshire Cats can fight!  //and scratch//

   The Board of Directors styled themselves The Electors
   And another con they tried to swing
   Now the BoD drinks Imperium Compound
   So we no longer need a King!                        

   AltChorus: Oh the Bod, the BoD, the BoD,
              It thinks it is God, is God, is God,
              The figure of Supreme Authority!
              And if we O.D.'d on Imperium Compund
              there'd be no need for Royalty!          

   Oh, MEDIEVAL Net, we thought it was all wet
   With witty remarks, and other kinds of sass
   We'll feed our computers on Imperium Compound
   And BYTE the BoD right on its' righteous ass!         

   Good old Duncan was often drunken
   Chasing all the ladies fair
   He bathed himself in Imperium Compound
   Now he has a little savoir faire!                     

                    (more)


  ATEN IMPERIUM (cont.)

   Ioseph of Locksley, never changes his socks, he
   Runs around looking like a Cavalier,
   He stocked up on Imperium Compound
   And he has enough to last for years and years!        

   AltChorus: Oh they forgot, forgot, forgot
              The Locks-e-ly Plot, the Plot, the Plot!
              And it works the best when it is underground!
              It isn't a hassle for a green-and-white tassle
              They're the ones that BREW Imperium Compound!  

   Trelon of the Wood, he was very good, he
   Was a leader that had never been beat before;
   But Caid had Imperium Compound,
   And Imperial Roman Caid won the War!  //with help!//   

   In Tyr Ysgithr, it's regularly whispered there
   That the Kingdom is ruled over by a King    // What's THAT? //
   They're ""democratic"" and quite erratic....
   They've forgot the purpose of the whole damn thing!     

   King Sir Mark von, 
"
raza1@gmail.com,fun4.txt,"ion that has over
5,000,000 ""fabrics of the common man"" - not the fancy brocades, etc., but
paisleys, calicoes, leaves and foliage, conversationals, block prints, and on,
and on - the kind of stuff that many of us in our quilts.
------
Most of its 461 pages are filled with excellent color pictures  (1,823
illustrations in color) of fabrics we'd all like to have. Color reproduction is
good and the pictures are large so that you can see the pattern detail. My only
serious criticism of the book is that reproductions are not all full-size or
even to the same scale. Page layout seems to have dictated the scale of
reproduction, and on the same page there are illustrations at 50%, 68% and 70%
full size, on other pages 27%, 100%, 120% and 150%. I suppose we should
appreciate the indication of scale included for each sample.

Although the book is expensive, it is not overpriced for a large format
art book with full-color illustrations on good quality paper. It has a
sewn binding and is very sturdily put together.

QUILT CLIP ART   ($10.95)
by Cheryl Petersen
Quiltessence/Fine Publications

It's a nice little book that has all kinds of sewing-related images, quilt
borders,  the word QUILT in various fonts and stylings, little quilts
flying pigs, thimbles and thread.

The nice part about this publisher is that you can order DISKS of
all the clip art (a necessity if you don't own a scanner!)  The clip
art is available for MACs in pict form on 3.5"" disks.  It is also
available for the IBM or clone, but you must call or write to them and
give them your graphic requirements.


COLOR WASH WORKBOOK ($12.95)
by Shirley Liby
Graphics Unlimited, 1993

This book is the result of Liby's creative play and her approach to the process
of color wash through a series of modules that seemed to simplify the whole
idea for her.

I like this book because it is in black and white and, therefore, easier to
separate values.  There are also a lot of grids that you can copy and play
around with your own designs.


COLOR CONFIDENCE FOR QUILTERS ($24.95)

This is Jinny's color system based on the use of a master palette of fabric
colors that span the spectrum.  By following the instructions in this book, you
create your own master palette that you can use as a tool for color choices
for all of your future quilting projects.  After creating your own color
palette, you will learn how to create countless color schemes just by taking
small sections of the palette, or by rearranging portions of it.

This book definitely helps you to gain confidence in choosing colors for your
projects.


CONTEMPORARY QUILTS FROM TRADITIONAL DESIGNS ($9.50 used)
by Carolyn L. Mosey
E. P. Dutton Publishers, New York 1988

This book takes a comparative look at the physical changes in the art of
quilting through the years.  While the overall appearance of quilts has
changed, many contemporary quiltmakers keep coming back to traditional
patterns.  The artists represented in this book share their feelings on the
history of quilting, the direction in which it is going and their viewpoints on
several quilt-related topics.

Interesting.  Provides a traditional quilt on one side of the page and a
quilter's contemporary rendition of the same pattern on the other.


COLLECTOR SCRAP QUILTS
(Book II in the Collector Quilt Series)
by Marti Michell
American School of Needlework, San Marcos, CA 1992

Second book in the collector series that features design inspiration from
antique quilts.  Pretty good instructional book.


COLOR AND CLOTH:  THE QUILTMAKER'S ULTIMATE WORKBOOK ($19.95)
by Mary Coyne Penders
The Quilt Digest Press, 1989

This is another good ""color confidence"" book. Underrated, probably because of
Jinny Beyer's book.


COLOR DESIGN IN PATCHWORK
by Paula Nadelstern
Dover Publications 1991

Explores how color can be used to vary one and the same patchwork
configuration. Depending on the placement of color and the resulting degree of
contrast, different shapes in a pieced pattern are emphasized and visually
linked.  Usually some shapes combine to form the main unit of design, while
remaining ones are interpreted as background.


COLORFUL ANGLES
(Triangles, Diamonds & Hexagons With a Contemporary Look)
by Susan Stein
EZ International  1993

This book combines the use of applique, traditional blocks, hand
dyed fabrics and the EZ tools (EZ Angle, Companion Angle, Easy Eight, Easy
Hexagon, Speed grids, trapezoids) to create very contemporary designs.  16
projects.  I think this is a good book.


CLUES IN THE CALICO; A Guide to Identifying and Dating
Antique Quilts  ($39.95)
by Barbara Brackman.
EPM Publications, 1989.

There are black and white and color pictures and examples and descriptions of
quilts characteristic of different periods. It is one of the best researched
and written quilt books I have encountered, and I have more than 300 books. I
put this in the top ten. Libraries and quilt guilds should have it.

Barbara Brackman also writes articles on quilt history for Quilters Newsletter
magazine. During the past year or so she has been writing about fabrics and how
to date them. I think she has done something on fabrics of the '40s, '50s and
later, but I can't locate the issue at the moment.


EAST QUILTS WEST ($24.95)
by Kumiko Sodo

It is wonderful!!!  She has many patterns that have  instructions for an
average to advanced quilter.  Her patterns are not,  on the most part, for the
faint of heart.  The best part, is the ideas  which spring forth from her many
designs.  I very, very seldom use a  design, even if given permission - I like
to make my own designe.  Her  book is an inspiration.  I hate to piece curves,
so I have been  appliqueing them down on top of the under piece after turning
under the  edge.  This is how she ""pieces"" her curves.  The book is rich in
color  and in interestingly narrated.  Her use of color is wonderful.
It is not a cheap book, but I would definitely recommend it.


ENCYCLOPEDIA OF QUILTING TECHNIQUES, THE ($24.95)
by Katherine Guerrier
Running Press, Philadelphia, PA  1994

Excellent book.  Colorful.  Describes:  techniques, block construction (she
gives you step by step instructions on how to make some of the more common
blocks (with color illustrations of each step) rotary cutting, special effects,
applique, quilting, finishing, etc. Toward the back of the book are gorgeous
quilts to truly inspire you.

This is a great reference book, great for beginners but can be used by
seasoned quilters as well.  A must for every quilter's library.


EVERY TRICK IN THE BOOK ($10.00)
by Ami Simms
Mallery Press, Flint, MI  1990

Over 500 tricks, tips, and tidbits for quilters .


EASY MACHINE PAPER PIECING
by Carol Doak
That Patchwork Place

I surrender -- I am a believer.  I attended a workshop last night on
foundation/paper piecing based on Carol Doak's book ""Easy Machine Paper
Piecing"".  It works, by golly, it works.  What a treat -- and I can turn
out such perfectly precise blocks.  It's wonderful.  If you haven't tried
it, you should -- attending a class really helps because you see how it's
done live.


ESSENTIAL QUILTER, THE
by Barbara Chainey ($29 .95)

A wonderful book.  It is a complete course in the lost art of hand quilting. It
covers everything you might need to know, and the clear photos show you how to
hold the needle, etc. The quilts are all Welsh or English, many are
""whole-cloth"" (all-quilted) quilts with beautiful feathers, scrolls, etc. Very
inspirational.


FOLK QUILTS AND HOW TO RECREATE THEM ($14.95)
by Audrey & Douglas Wiss
Sterling/Main Street, NY 1990

This book presents a wide selection of traditional designs for the modern
quilter which have been tested over time.  They are presented in their original
colors and special configurations.  Some date back as far as the 18th century;
others became popular as late as the 1930s.  A few are worked in wool or silk;
most are piecd of plain or printed cottons.  All were made in America and
display a variety of piecing, applique and quilting techniques.
I like this collection.


FAST PATCH - A TREASURY OF STRIP QUILT PROJECTS ($17.95)
by Anita Hallock
Chilton Book Co., Radnor, PA  1989

This is a very good book for beginners and everyone else.  A new strip
technique for making triangles.

Step-by-step instructions.  By making a checkerboard and turning it on the
bias, you can learn to cut strips of triangles, opening up a whole range of
traditional blocks like the Ohio Star and sawtooth borders.

JACKET JAZZ ($21.95)
by Judy Murrah
AQS

One woman in
my guild made a jacket in it and just raved about
the book.  She said it was totally lucid, thorough, etc.
----
This book has a nifty way to make Prairie Points from a strip of fabric.  I've
tried it for trim on a vest and it was very easy.
----
This book has 5 wonderful jacket patterns in it. In the book, she shows how to
do 36 different things to put on a jacket. A few will look very familiar to
most quilters such as a strip of flying geese, though making it without cutting
any triangles may be a new technique. Some such as woven prairie points I had
never seen or heard mentioned before, though I know we have mentioned the
standard prairie points before.

MY MOTHER'S QUILTS/DESIGNS FROM THE THIRTIES
by Sara Nephew,
That Patchwork Place

I love this one -- it really got me into 30s quilts -- and it's my inspiration,
since I just purchased two 30s tops that need batting, backing,etc.


MORE LAP QUILTING
by Georgia Bonesteel

There is an ""Offset Maple Leaf"" pattern in this book also complete with
templates. This particular block contains one large maple leaf and three little
maple leaves, all pointing in the same direction.  Personally, I think she does
one odd thing with this block, namely leveling off the bottom of the leaves.
But that's easily fixed.  And as a definite amateur, I probably shouldn't be
questioning the wisdom of quilting teacher.


MEMORY QUILTS:  DELIGHTFUL WAYS TO CAPTURE TODAY FOREVER

NEW SAMPLER QUILT, THE
by Diane Leone

I was flipping through this book yesterday and I found what I thought to be a
great tip. She suggests that early in the day (or whenever you have a minute)
to thread a bunch of betweens with quilting thread. That way when you sit down
to quilt, they will all be ready to go, no stopping to thread and knot!


NIFTY NINE PATCHES
by Carolann M. Palmer

If anyone ever thought ninepatches were humdrum, this should change their mind.
This book also has good instructions on quick rotary cutting and piecing
techniques. My two favorites in this book were the Trellis Garden which looks
like a trellis of interlocking rings with a bright flower garden growing
through it and Morning Dew which I would have called Mideastern Fruit Salad. If
anyone knows the name and maker of the brightly colored fruit fabric used in
this example, I would love to know.


NINE PATCH WONDERS
by Blanche Young and Helen Young Frost
First Star publishers, Tucson, Arizona  1991

Shows what can be done with a nine patch block (interesting color plays,
optical illusions, three dimensional woven effects).

The best of traditional designs as well as some original variations.  Some
quilts are made with all Nine Patch blocks; others combine the pieced blocks
with background blocks.  Others are variations on the Double Nine Patch design,
where pieced blocks are joined with plain squares to form large Nine Patch
blocks.  Combining the 9Patch with other shapes, such as rectangles or
triangles, creates even more variations.


NEW QUILTING AND PATCHWORK DICTIONARY, THE  ($12.95)
by Goldberg, Rhoda Ochser
New York: Crown, 1988.

This should be in EVERY quilter's library.  It has 1,740 illustrations, which
includes all the ""classics"" of our repetoire plus many charming original
designs (a baby bottle block, international signal flags, a pieced panda,
etc.)All black and white illustrations, but so comprehensive most people won't
even notice!


NEW JERSEY QUILTS 1777 to 1950

ONE-OF-A-KIND QUILTS
(Simple Steps to Individual Quilts) ($16.95)
by Judy Martin
That Patchwork Place 1989

One-of-a-Kind Quilts are structured scrap quilts--everyday quilts that feature
a planned theme or focal area surrounded by blocks made in a variety of
patterns, with the overall design developing as the piece is made.

This book takes you step-by-step through the theme blocks and the background
blocks, covering everything from cutting and construction techniques to the
creative decisions that are made along the way.  Suggestions for completing the
quilts are included.  Master templates and quick-cutting information for the
background blocks are provided toward the end of the book. An excellent book.


PAINLESS BORDERS
by Sally Schneider

This book presents 16 cleverly designed quilts and borders in which the border
is pieced along with the quilt.  My favorite is the twisted ribbon border
which looks like a double sided twisted ribbon cascading along the border.
She provides lots of suggestions for clever and fast cutting/piecing.


PATCHWORK PATTERNS ($18.95)
Jinny Beyer
EPM Publications, Inc., McLean, VA  1979

This book is written for those who have an interest in using traditional
geometric designs or a desire to create their own original motifs.

It explains in a systematic manner a method of drafting patterns which has, in
large, been put aside, and about which no comprehensive book has been written.
She also explains a few simple drafting techniques which are particularly
useful in making geometric designs.


PATCHWORK PLANNER, THE: 350 Original Designs for Traditional Patchwork $27.95
by Birte Hilberg, 1993
David & Charles, Brunel House, Newton, Abbot, Devon.

She did seven years in research and development, using a specially devised
computer program (help from her husband), and presents 350 new designs, using
combinations of these simple blocks.  ""This collection provides a rich source
of fresh and original ideas to delight all patchworkers, and all designers who
use geometric patterns.""

I found it very interesting and expect to read it again and again, and will use
it when attempting to design quilts of my own using Adobe Illustrator.  She has
come up with figures, circular designs, lots in color, lots in black and white
that could be colored in wonderful ways. She presents her ""Tile Library,"" which
could easily be duplicated on the computer (so you could manipulate your own).
The blocks/tiles are simple.  She hand pieces, but most can be machine pieced
easily.

Lots of ideas for developing one's own original designs.

 Parallel Algorithm:
At the beginning of the algorithm, each processor holds a portion of the Dataset “D”. If the total number of data objects in “D” is “n”, and the total number of processors is “p”, then each processor receives “n/p” data objects. That means the computation time is reduced by a factor of “p”.
1. Root (process with rank=0) calculates the initial means of the “k” centroid vectors.
2. Root Broadcasts these “k” vectors to all the processors.
3. Each process computes distance of each local document vector to “k” centroid vectors.

A detailed analysis of the time behavior of Montgomery reduction with the various optimizations taken into account can be found in [Boss]. There we are promised a ten to twenty percent saving in time over modular exponentiation by using Montgomery multiplication. As can be seen in the overviews in Appendix D of typical calculation times for FLINT/C functions, our implementations bear out this claim fully. To be sure, we have the restriction that the exponentiation functions that use Montgomery reduction can be used only for odd moduli. Nonetheless, for many applications, for example for encryption and decryption, as well as for computing digital signatures according to the RSA procedure (see Chapter 17), the functions mexp5m_l() and mexpkm_l() are the functions of choice.
Altogether, we have at our disposal a number of capable functions for modular exponentiation. To obtain an overview, in Table 6-5 we collect these functions together with their particular properties and domains of application.

Chapter 6
6.5  Cryptographic Application of Exponentiation
We have worked hard in this chapter in our calculation of powers, and it is reasonable to ask at this point what modular exponentiation might have to offer to cryptographic applications. The first example to come to mind is, of course, the RSA procedure, which requires a modular exponentiation for encryption and decryption—assuming suitable keys. However, the author would like to ask his readers for a bit (or perhaps even a byte) of patience, since for the RSA procedure we still must collect a few more items, which we do in the next chapter. We shall return to this extensively in Chapter 17.
For those incapable of waiting, we offer as examples of the application of exponentiation two important algorithms, namely, the procedure suggested in 1976 by Martin E. Hellman and Whitfield Diffie [Diff] for the exchange of cryptographic keys and the encryption procedure of Taher ElGamal as an extension of the Diffie–Hellman procedure.
The Diffie–Hellman procedure represents a cryptographic breakthrough, namely, the first public key, or asymmetric, cryptosystem (see Chapter 17). Two years after its publication, Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman published the RSA procedure (see [Rive]). Variants of the Diffie–Hellman procedure are used today for key distribution in the Internet communications and security protocols IPSec, IPv6, and SSL, which were developed to provide security in the transfer of data packets in the IP protocol layer and the transfer of data at the application level, for example from the realms of electronic commerce. This principle of key distribution thus has a practical significance that would be difficult to overestimate.3
With the aid of the Diffie–Hellman protocol two communicators, Ms. A and Mr. B, say, can negotiate in a simple way a secret key that then can be used for the encryption of communications between the two. After A and B have agreed on
a large prime number p and a primitive root a modulo p (we shall return to this below), the Diffie–Hellman protocol runs as follows.
Protocol for key exchange à la Diffie–Hellman
1. AchoosesanarbitraryvaluexA ≤p−1andsendsyA :=axA modpasher public key to B.
2. BchoosesanarbitraryvaluexB ≤p−1andsendsyB :=axB modpashis public key to A.
3 IP Security (IPSec), developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), is, as an extensive security protocol, a part of the future Internet protocol IPv6. It was created so that it could also be used in the framework of the then current Internet protocol (IPv4). Secure Socket Layer (SSL) is a security protocol developed by Netscape that lies above the TCP protocol, which offers end-to-end security for applications such as HTTP, FTP, and SMTP (for all of this see [Stal], Chapters 13 and 14).
 118
3. A computes the secret key sA := yxA mod p. B
4. B computes the secret key sB := yxB mod p. A
Since
sA ≡yxA ≡axBxA ≡yxB ≡sB modp, BA
after step 4, A and B are dealing with a common key. The values p and a do not have to be kept secret, nor the values yA and yB exchanged in steps 1 and 2. The security of the procedure depends on the difficulty in calculating discrete logarithms in finite fields, and the difficulty of breaking the system is equivalent to that of calculating values xA or xB from values yA or yB in Zp.4 That the calculation of axy from ax and ay in a finite cyclic group (the Diffie–Hellman problem) is just as difficult as the calculation of discrete logarithms and thus equivalent to this problem is, in fact, conjectured but has not been proved.
To ensure the security of the procedure under these conditions the modulus p must be chosen sufficiently large (at least 1024 bits, better 2048 or more; see Table 17-1), and one should ensure that p − 1 contains a large prime divisor close to (p − 1)/2 to exclude particular calculational procedures for discrete logarithms (a constructive procedure for such prime numbers will be presented in Chapter 17 in connection with the generation of strong primes, for example for the RSA procedure).
The procedure has the advantage that secret keys can be generated as needed on an ad hoc basis, without the need for secret information to be held for a long time. Furthermore, for the procedure to be used there are no further infrastructure elements necessary for agreeing on the parameters a and b. Nonetheless, this protocol possesses some negative characteristics, the gravest of which is the lack of authentication proofs for the exchanged parameters yA and yB. This makes the procedure susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks, whereby attacker X intercepts the messages of A and B with their public keys yA and yB and replaces them with falsified messages to A and B containing his own public key yX.
Then A and B calculate “secret” keys s  := yxA mod p and s  := yxB mod p, AX BX
while X on his or her part calculates s  from yxX ≡ axAxX ≡ axXxA ≡ yxA ≡ AAX
s A mod p and s B analogously. The Diffie–Hellman protocol has now been executed not between A and B, but between X and A as well as between X and B. Now X is in a position to decode messages from A or B and to replace them by falsified messages to A or B. What is fatal is that from a cryptographic point of view the participants A and B are clueless as to what has happened.
To compensate for these defects without giving up the advantages, several variants and extensions have been developed for use in the Internet. They all take into account the necessity that key information be exchanged in such a way that

its authenticity can be verified. This can be achieved, for example, by the public keys being digitally signed by the participants and the associated certificate
of a certification authority being sent with them (see in this regard page 400, Section 17.3), which is implemented, for example, in the SSL protocol. IPSec and IPv6 use a complexly constructed procedure with the name ISAKMP/Oakley,5 which overcomes all the drawbacks of the Diffie–Hellman protocol (for details see [Stal], pages 422–423).
To determine a primitive root modulo p, that is, a value a whose powers
ai mod p with i = 0,1,...,p − 2 constitute the entire set of elements of the
multiplicative group Z×p = { 1, . . . , p − 1 } (see in this regard Section10.2), the
following algorithm can be used (see [Knut], Section 3.2.1.2, Theorem C). It is
assumed that the prime factorization p − 1 = Pe1 ···pek of the order of Z× is 1kp
known.

         Available: Easily available
         Certainty: not known
         Notes:     Soak 100 grammes of tabacco for a few days. You get a
                    brown mess. Strain off the tabacco, then simmer slowly

   Notes:     Difficult to overcome fear of heights, many people can't do it.
              Totally painless if high enough, but very frightening.
              Easily discovered if seen on/near roof/windows. Access fairly
              easy in a city, otherwise difficult. Risk of spending the
              rest of your life in a wheelchair. Ever tried killing yourself

4. SLITTING WRISTS OR OTHER (pathetic)
   Time:      Minutes if major artery cut, eternity otherwise
   Available: You really need a razor sharp knife. Razors are pretty tricky
              to hold when they are covered with blood
   Certainty: Uncertain if you cut an artery, highly improbable otherwise
   Notes:     Painful at first. Danger of discovery. This is a very common
              suicide 'gesture' and hardly ever results in anything other
              than a scar. A lot of will power required to cut deeply into
              groin or carotid arteries, which are the only ones likely to
              kill you. Don't bother with this method. Cutting your throat
              is difficult due to the fact that the carotid arteries
              are protected by your windpipe (feel where your arteries are
              with your fingertips, & slice from the side). I've seen photos
              of people who have used this method - the depth of the cut
              required is amazing. If you want to cut your wrists, cut along
              the blue line (vein) on the underside of your wrist, but cut
              deeply so that the artery underneath is exposed. Cut this
              lengthways with a razor or similar.

5. BULLET
   Time:      Microseconds unless you are unlucky (mins/hours)
   Available: Difficult in UK, easier in USA (get a shotgun)
   Certainty: Certain
   Notes:     Painless if worked, otherwise painful & brain damage.
              Danger of discovery of weapon or ammunition.
              Not at all common in UK, more common in USA where guns
              available. Brain damage & other effects if you survive.
              Death either instantaneous, or prolonged.
              Lots of will power needed to fire gun ('hesitation marks'
              are bullets/pellets embedded in the wall, when you jerk
              the gun as you fire). Bullet can miss vital parts in skull,
              deflect off skull.
              NOTE, fill mouth with water, aim about 45 degrees from
              vertical, this is reliable* since shockwave from water will
              kill instantly.
              *NOTE, several people have suggested that this is unreliable.
              See ""Shotgun"" below (since much more effective).
              Ammunition to use is: .458 Winchester Magnum, or soft-point
              slugs with .44 Magnum. Also you could use a sabot round, which
              is a plastic wedge with a smaller thing in it. These rounds are
              rather overkill, the phrase ""elephant gun"" has been used about
              the .458 Winchester, but if you're going to go, do it with
              a bang

6. ASPHYXIATION
   Time:      5 mins to unconciousness, 10+ mins to brain death
   Available: Anywhere there's a rope and something solid to tie it to
   Certainty: Certain, if yoou don't get ""rescued""
   Notes:     Panic reaction is very likely (unless inert gasses used).
              One of the most effective and most used methods of suicide.
              Probable brain damage if you are ""rescued"".
              NOTE, this can only really be done in two ways: firstly,
              when you are unconsious (eg, sleeping pills), or secondly,
              by hanging. Combining with pure inert gasses is a very good
              suggestion. See ""Nitrogen"" in the poisons section

7. AIR IN VEINS (basically just a myth)
   Time:      Eternity
   Available: Plenty of air about... Need a hypodermic & syringe
   Certainty: Almost zero (you might catch something from the needle)
   Notes:     This doesn't work, unless you inject absolutely massive
              amounts of air (it all goes out of the lungs). Myth caused
              by the way that doctors squirt a syringe before using it to
              get rid of contaminants. If you have to try it, go for the
              carotid artery, since this goes to the brain. If you want
              a heart attack, you will have to inject something on the order
              of 20-50ml every heart-beat (these are ball-park figures) for
              several heart beats. Good luck

8. DECAPITATION
   Time:      Couple of seconds before conciousness fades
   Available: Happen to have a train line nearby? Or a guillotine perhaps?
   Certainty: Very certain, unless you pull away just before
   Notes:     See ""jumping in front of trains"". May be difficult to stop
              pulling your head out of the way - OD on sleeping tablets
              first

9. DISEMBOWELMENT (aka seppuku/hara kiri)
   Time:      Minutes
   Available: Got a nice razor-sharp sword?
   Certainty: Fairly certain, assuming that you managed to gut yourself
              properly before passing out with the agony
   Notes:     Painful, even the Samurai used a 'second' to decapitate them
              at the appropriate point, so don't expect to do much more than
              give yourself peritonitis. Trendy for insane martial arts
              fanatics and gay Japanese poets called Mishima.

10. DROWNING
   Time:      Minutes (usually 5 mins, but up to 20 mins in cold water)
   Available: Anywhere there's deep water in a remote spot
   Certainty: Good, just make sure you sink & can't swim
   Notes:     Put stones in your pockets, tie your legs & hands together,
              and hop into the lake.. bit of a shock to the fisherman who
              finds your rotting corpse stuck in his brand new net.

11. ELECTROCUTION
   Time:      Seconds / minutes
   Available: Anywhere with high-tension, high-current lines & a good earth
   Certainty: Somewhat dependant on luck & how much power goes through you
   Notes:     Don't bother with 110 or 240 volt mains, its just not enough.
              Some people do get killed with household electricity, but only
              after several minutes. Use high tension lines, stand in bare
              feet on waterlogged ground (better still, but a piece of THICK
              copper cable into the nearest river). Works best if current
              path travels through your head, or through the heart. Just
              burns you badly otherwise.

12. EXPLOSIVES
   Time:      10 milliseconds, or similar (!)
   Available: Difficult to get hold of detonator & good explosives
   Certainty: Certain if detonator works properly
   Notes:     DON'T USE GUNPOWDER or other 'slow' explosives (eg,
              homemade explosives). Use dynamite or 'Plastique', strap
              it to your forehead with the detonator, and BOOM! The main
              problem is with getting hold of high explosives (I know the
              recipe for Nitro-Glycerine, but home manufacture is extremely
              risky, and the product is unstable). If you can get a grenade,
              use it, it's probably the best way of doing this one.

13. FREEZING TO DEATH
   Time:      several hours (15 minutes in very cold water)
   Available: Got a large chest freezer? Is the outside temp < -10 degrees?
   Certainty: good if you don't get found
   Notes:     Soak your cloths in water, get into freezer / outside
              somewhere where you won't be found. Helps to get pissed
              first - drink yourself silly. If you are near a very
              cold supply of water (eg, the North Sea, or similar) which is
              close to zero degrees, this is particularly good, since the
              average lifespan of someone in the water is 15 minutes.

14. JUMPING IN FRONT OF TRAINS
   Time:      Seconds (or hours if unlucky)
   Available: Anywhere near a HIGH-SPEED railway line
   Certainty: Depends on your timing & speed of train. Go for decapitation
   Notes:     Probably better to put your neck on the line, since a glancing
              blow would probably break your spine (& cripple you). High
              speed trains need a kilometer to stop, so find a blind corner.
              A friend's cousin did this, worked well.

15. SELF-IMMOLATION
   Time:      Seconds to days
   Available: Anywhere you can get petrol & a match
   Certainty: good as long as you are far away from medical help
   Notes:     bloody painful - one of the most agonising ways to die.
              If you do survive, you will be disfigured for the rest
              of your life.
              Try mixing the petrol with an explosive like TNT or NG,
              this will make it burn MUCH quicker, even if the explosive
              is very dilute. My Dad worked at a dynamite factory, and knew
              someone who used to put TNT into his car (1 teaspoon per
              gallon). It burned out the engine in a couple of months.

16. STARVING TO DEATH
   Time:      Typically a month, although depends on your health to
              start with, and how much fat is available
   Available: Anywhere where you can't be force-fed
   Certainty: Certain as long as you never get any medical help (this is
              tricki

raza1@gmail.com,fun2.txt,"on -- Through the uses of local BBS systems
and NETs which send messages to other people in the United
States.  Soon Raphael Dareau, Merlin and Crunch ""The Gold Is
In Your Eat But It Doesn't Melt In Your Hands"" began to
spread it through the Local BBS's starting with Pinnacle Club
II and James Bond Hideaway.  And after a period of time from
which the local universe itself was bombarded with the
concept of Spam, people began to use aliases such as
""SpamMan"" and more interesting phrases were created such as
""It is Raph, the SpamMan with all the answers,"" ""Eat Your
Spam, Little Boy"" which eventually transformed into ""Eat Your
TriTel, Little Boy"", but that will become a entirely
different story (read The Story Of TriTel by Raphael Dareau).
 
 
     Pretty soon Balzac came into the picture and with him
came a whole new collection of BBS's to spread the legend of
Spam.  The great one, called Electra Byte BBS, became Spam
Central as it was like Avatar in many ways -- multiuser!
People there got tired of Spam and shut the messages from The
Slingers Of The Spam off, all except the few who would
actually listen.
 
     And it was now that the Nationally Famous Spam Festival
in Minnesota took place.  However, none of the Slingers Of
The Spams had enough funding to attend, but they were there
in their soul, wishing they could have been in the Spam
Sculpting Contest.
 
     And then Spam split in two and began to spread in
different directions.
 
     One branch went to Orono High School and another went to
John Bapst Memorial High School.  Raphael Dareau, a well
known person there, began to spread it amoung his fellow
comrades.  Half of them hated the entire concept and became
the Anti-Spam.  A few joined The Neutral Luncheon Meat and
changed their name to just ""Vienna Sausages"" while Raphael
Dareau and Mike ""The Gavmeister"" became the eventual leaders
of the Spam inside the school community.  Leo, Don and the
Sexman headed the leadership of the Anti-Spam while the
Vienna Sausage just became like a socialist society within
the John Bapst System.
 
     This finally led to the Spam Incident, in which case
Raphael Dareau brought in a can of Spam at a local
tournament.  The Anti-Spam basically called foul, broke open
the can of Spam, and engulfed the library with its odor.  The
Slingers Of The Spam immediately called sacrilidge and began
to worship the Spam before a kind person decided to clean it
up before it rotted.
 
     Back to other news, Crunch and Merlin spread it around
Orono High School and not much is known about w

                    programs (with viewing & searching features) for you
                    to distribute.  Analyze readability, check spelling,
                    statistical analysis, sorting, indexing, multiple
                    files/windows.  Very easy to learn and use.

        TEXTLIFE:   Text file to .EXE program converter.

        CONTROL3:   File manager, lists three drives/directories on screen
                    simultaneously.

        LIFEGAME:   Graphical simulation of natural systems.

        DI:         Directory program for moving quickly around your
                    hard disk.

        And four computer books:

        POISON FOR THE HEART:   The ultimate philosophy.

        Written in an aphoristic style for those who don't like to waste
        their time with padding.  Discusses the law of cause and effect
        and its far reaching ramifications.  Investigates the nature of
        the ego, attachment, religion, men and women.  Arguably the only
        book a thinking person needs to read.


        WIT FOR WISDOM:   Compact truth.

        ""Wit for Wisdom"" is a compilation of the most incisive gems of
        wit, along with a few drops of my own blood.  Unlike normal
        collections of quotes, aphorisms and apothegms, this work has
        both a purpose and a message.  So this is not so much a book for
        wits, but for thinkers.  Wit for wisdom is a kind of wit that is
        too witty even for wits.  Of all the areas of interest covered
        in this work, the subjects of the sexes and the relationships
        between them predominate, they being responsible for the larger
        part of our foolishness.  The viewing program allows you to send
        the text to your printer or to a text file on disk.


        VENOM CRYSTALS:

        A compilation of the most powerful spiritual/philosophic
        writings of all time.  Includes the best from Buddhism,
        Christianity, Hinduism, Taoism, Kierkegaard, and Nietzsche.


        LETTERS BETWEEN ENEMIES:

        Amazing correspondence between two thinkers.  Explores the life
        experiences and philosophies of two friends on the path to
        Knowledge.

                               ""Love hurts""

                          by John E. Pickersgill
                                Tasmania


                     I knew a man called Tom McPherson.
                     He was a very clumsy person.
                     Two left arms and two left feet,
                     The clumsiest man you'd ever meet.

                     Each step he took he fell down twice.
                     He tripped and stumbled all through life.
                     Accidents that couldn't happen
                     Were Tom McPherson's daily pattern.

                     Now you may doubt and you may scoff,
                     But he's fell in and he's fell off,

be replicated by hundreds of future rock groups.
   On returning to England, the Beatles were rewarded by the British
aristocracy they served so well . In October 1965, the four were
inducted into the Order of Chivalry, and were personally awarded the
accolade of Member of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth at
Buckingham palace.


Up from the Dregs:
The Rolling Stones

   The credit for the origination of today's blatantly Satanic ""heavy
metal rock,'' goes to the English group, the Rolling Stones. Their
rise to fame was closely connected with that of the Beatles.
   The Stones, as they were called, were widely characterized as the
counterparts to the Beatles. ""The Stones'' were ""mean,'' ""dirty'' and
""rebellious,'' whereas the Beatles were the well-groomed ""Fab Four.''
Though seemingly competitors, they were merely two sides of the same
operation. The Stones' first hit record was actually written by the
Beatles, and it was Beatle member George Harrison who set up the
arrangements for their first recording contract.
   Following the same game plan as the Beatles, in the spring of 1963
the Rolling Stones appeared on one of England's most popular family
television shows, <Thank Your Lucky Stars.> Only this time, the
reaction by the middle-aged viewers was quite different from that to
the Beatles. Hundreds of angry letters were sent, with a typical
letter stating ""It is disgraceful that long-haired louts such as these
should be allowed to appear on television. Their appearance was
absolutely disgusting.''
    The program, however, had exactly the planned effect. Rolling
Stones' manager Andrew Oldham was elated at the response. He told the
group, ""We're going to make you exactly opposite to those nice, clean,
tidy Beatles. And the more the parents hate you, the more the kids
will love you. Just wait and see.''
   In 1964, the Rolling Stones appeared on the <Ed Sullivan Show>, as
the Beatles had done earlier. This time though, the coast-to-coast
audience beheld the spectacle of the television studio being ripped to
shreds by Stones fans.  Sullivan said on the air afterward, ""I promise
you, they will never be back on our show.'' The publicity, however,
was exactly what was wanted. Within a few months, the group's records
were selling millions of copies.
   The plan was now to use both the Beatles and the Rolling Stones as
the means to transform an entire generation into heathen followers of
the New Age, followers which could mold into the future cadre of a
Satanic movement and then deploy into our schools, law enforcment
agencies and political leadership.


Enter Satan

   In his book, <The Ultimate Evil,> investigator-author Maury Terry
writes that between 1966 and 1967, the Satanic cult, the Process
Church, ""sought to recruit the Rolling Stones and the Beatles.''
During this period, Terry reports that a photo of Rolling Stones
leader Mick Jagger's longtime girlfriend, Marianne Faithfull, appeared
in an issue of <The Process Magazine>. The picture shows her supine,
as if dead, clutching a rose. Terry's book goes on to implicate the
Process Church cult in the Charles Manson and Son of Sam multiple
murders. It was the former lawyer for the Process Church, John
Markham, who recently ran the frameup trial against Lyndon LaRouche.
   A key link between the Rolling Stones and the Process Church is
Kenneth Anger, a follower of the ""founding father'' of modern
Satanism, Aleister Crowley. Anger, born in 1930, and a child Hollywood
movie star, became a devoted disciple of Crowley.
   Crowley was born in 1875 and was called the ""Great Beast.'' He was
known to practice ritual child sacrifice regularly, in his role as
Satan's high priest or ""Magus.'' Crowley died in 1947 due to
complications of his huge heroin addiction. Before dying, he succeeded
in establishing Satanic covens in many U.S. cities including
Hollywood. Anger, like Crowley, is a Magus, and appears to be the heir
to Crowley.
   Anger was seventeen years old when Crowley died. In that same year,
1947, Anger was already producing and directing films which, even by
today's standards, reek of pure evil.
   During 1966-1967, when the Process Church is reported to be
recruiting in London, Anger was also on the scene. Author Tony Sanchez
describes that Rolling Stones' Mick Jagger and Keith Richard, and
their girlfriends Marianne Faithfull and Anita Pallenburg, ""listened
spellbound as Anger turned them on to Crowley's powers and ideas.''
   While in England, Anger worked on a film dedicated to Aleister
Crowley, called <Lucifer Rising>. The film brought together the
Process Church, the Manson Family cult, and the Rolling Stones. The
music for the film was composed by Mick Jagger. Process Church
follower Marianne Faithfull went all the way to Egypt to participate
in the film's depiction of a Black Mass. The part of Lucifer was
played by a guitarist of a California rock group, Bobby Beausoleil.
Beausoleil was a member of the Manson Family, and Anger's homosexual
lover.
   A few months after filming under Anger's direction in England,
Beausoleil returned to California to commit the first of the Manson
Family's series of gruesome murders. Beausoleil was later arrested and
is now serving a life sentence in prison along with Manson. Having
lost his star performer, Anger then asked Mick Jagger to play Lucifer.
He finally settled upon Anton La Vey, author of <The Satanic Bible>
and head of the First Church of Satan, to play the part. The film was
released in 1969 with the title <Invocation To My Demon Brother.>
   In London, Anger had succeeded in recruiting to Satanism the
girlfriend of one of the Rolling Stones, Anita Pallenberg. Pallenberg
had met the Rolling Stones in 1965. She immediately began sexual
relations with three out of the five members of the group.
   Anger, commenting on Anita, said, ""I believe that Anita is, for
want of a better word, a witch...The occult unit within the Stones was
Keith and Anita...and Brian. You see, Brian was a witch too.''
   One of the group's friends, Tony Sanchez, writes of Pallenberg in
his book, <Up and Down with the Rolling Stones>, ""She was obsessed
with black magic and began to carry a string of garlic with her
everywhere--even to bed--to ward off vampires. She also had a strange
mysterious old shaker for holy water which she used for some of her
rituals. Her ceremonies became increasingly secret, and she warned me
never to interrupt her when she was working on a spell.''
   He continues, ""In her bedroom she kept a huge, ornate carved chest,
which she guarded so jealously that I assumed it was her drug stash.
The house was empty one day, and I decided to take a peep inside. The
drawers were filled with scraps of bone, wrinkled skin and fur from
some strange animals.''
   In 1980, the seventeen-year-old caretaker of Keith Richard's New
England estate was found shot to death in Anita Pallenberg's bed. The
death, ruled a suicide, was with Pallenberg's gun. Richard's house was
located near the East Coast headquarters of the Process Church.
According to an article in the English newspaper <Midnite>, a
Connecticut police officer, Michael Passaro, who had responed to the
""suicide'' reported ""strange singing'' from the woods a quarter mile
from the Richard's mansion.
   The newpaper continues, ""There have been several bizarre satanic
rituals in the area over the past five years. A local reporter
attributed the outbreak of occultism to 'rich people taking Acid.'|''
   In 1967, reflecting their ongoing association with Anger and the
Process Church, the Rolling Stones released their first rock album
openly celebrating the Devil, titled, ""Their Satanic Majesties
Request.'' A few months earlier, the Beatles had released their first
album dedicated to the promotion of psychedelic drugs, ""Sargeant
Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.'' The album contained a fantasized
version of an LSD trip, called ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds,'' or
L.S.D. for short. It became a top seller.
   Clearly, the Beatles' album was dedicated to Satanist Aleister
Crowley.  It was released 20 years, nearly to the day, after Crowley's
death in 1947, and its title song began with the lyrics, ""It was
twenty years ago today...'' The album's cover featured a picture of
Crowley.
   One month after the album's release, the Beatles shocked the world
by announcing, publicly, that they were regularly taking LSD. Beatle
member Paul McCartney, in an interview with <Life> magazine said, ""LSD
opened my eyes. We only use one-tenth of our brain.'' They also
publicly called for the legalization of marijuana.
   The cat was now out of the bag, but the protests were few and
minor. In England, the BBC banned ""A Day in the Life,'' and in the
U.S.A., Maryland Governor Spiro T.Agnew, who would later be
watergated, launched a campaign to ban ""Lucy in the Sky With
Diamonds.''


Creating the Counterculture

   The year 1967 marked a significant escalation in open cultural
warfare against the youth of the United States.  The year saw the
beginning of mass, open-air rock concerts. In the two years which
followed, over 4 million young people attended a series of nearly a
dozen of these ""festivals,'' becoming the victims of planned,
wide-scale drug experimentation. Mind destroying hallucinogenic drugs
such as PCP, STP, and the Beatles-promoted LSD, were freely
distributed at these concerts. These millions of attendees would
afterward return to their homes to become the messengers and promoters
of the new drug culture, or what came to be called the ""New Age.''
   The first rock festival, ""The First Annual Monterey International
Pop Festival,'' was attended by over 100,000 youngsters. The real
purpose of Monterey Pop was the widespread distrubution of a new type
of drugs, classified as psychedelics or hallucinogens, such as LSD. At
Monterey, thousands of younger teen-agers were introduced to the new
hallucinogenic drugs.
   The first experimentation with LSD was begun in the early sixties,
in the Haight-Ashbury section of San Francisco. The project was run by
a joint CIA-British intelligence task fo
"

substances, loaded with vitamins, minerals, amino acids, and other healthy
substances, is to aid in brain functioning. Smart Drinks are most often
consumed at raves, thus, the purpose of some smart drinks is to ""energize""
the drinker, not to make them smarter.

Sprawl - Word used by William Gibson to mean large mega-cities, and places
where different cities collide. Southern California and New York City
might be early examples of the sprawl. This word is used often in modern
times as ""urban sprawl"".

Steve Jackson Games - RPG manufacturers that have played a key role in the
evolution of cyberpunk and the computer underground. Operators of the
Illuminati BBS and makers of GURPS Cyberpunk, an RPG guide written by Loyd
Blankenship, a member of the Legion of Doom.

Sterling, Bruce - considered by most to be the ""co-founder"" of cyberpunk
along with William Gibson. He is the editor of ""Mirrorshades: A cyberpunk
anthology,"" which is considered the quintessential collection of cyberpunk
works by the mirrorshades group. Some of his other works include ""Islands
in the Net"", ""Schismatrix"", ""Involution Ocean"", ""The Artificial Kid"", ""The
Difference Engine"" which he co-authored with Gibson and ""The Hacker
Crackdown"" a non-fiction account of the computer underground and Operation
Sundevil, including the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Phrack, the Legion
of Doom, Steve Jackson Games, etc. Sterling has also been a vocal member
of the net. Keep your eyes open, you never know where he will surface next.

Social Engineering - Technique by which hackers or crackers acquire
information, such as names and passwords.  Essentially a modern-day con,
often conducted via phone conversations, such as portraying oneself as a
telco employee.

TBT - Talking by Typing.

Techno- - prefix similar to cyber-, referring to anything which has its
roots in current or futuristic technology.

Techno - type of music made almost entirely with the help of computers,
revolving around a fast-paced drum beat (as high as 160 BPM), sampling,
and synthesizers.

Technoculture - The idea of a culture with a strong foundation rooted  in
technology. Often used loosely in association with cyberculture and new edge.

Techno-paganism - Literally the worshipping of technology. Many people
*believe* that, for example, the net has some magic or is a sentient
entity in itself, or that technology can be an agent of evolution.
(sidebar Aleph spew)

Teledildonics - Virtual sex in a virtual environment. Term often used by
the new edge community. (sidebar: from new CD to magazine to etc)

Toasternet - Putting together a LAN, WAN or Internet hook up with the
cheapest of technology. Read up on Toasternets on the Wells Gopher.

Usenet - A collection of ""newsgroups"" on the Internet, in which Internet
users may post or read messages on almost any subject imaginable. The
topics of discussion are divided up into the individual newsgroups, which
total about 2000 on average. Usenet is divided into various large
sections, including the 'alt'ernative newsgroups, the 'comp'uter
newsgroups, the 'sci'ence newsgroups and the 'talk' newsgroups, among
others. Some groups are moderated, while most remain completely
uncensored. Usenet is often referred to as Abusenet for its all-too
familiar flames and appearance of perpetual chaos.

Virtual Community - any group or gathering that exists in cyberspace. This
could be a BBS, a hacking group, a net, or even a zaibatsu.

Virtual Culture - the collection of virtual communities, and the cultural
aspects unique to those communities.

Virtual Reality - a consentual hallucination of a world existing only in
cyberspace.  Modern day virtual reality uses helmets, gloves, and body
suits to create such a world, which is first created on a computer and
connected to the vr devices. A goal of some virtual reality researchers is
to generate a completely alternate reality. Research in vr includes
networking people, so spatial limitations are meaningless. The
possibilities of vr-generated environments are as limitless as the
imagination.

Virtual World - a world existing in cyberspace created and used with
virtual reality technologies.

WELL - The Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link. An important gridpoint in the
matrix, a virtual community in cyberspace, also a BBS connected to the
Internet. A group concerned mostly with cyberpunk, virtual reality,
nootropics, and other aspects of the new edge. Many celebreties have an
account on the Well.

WIRED - A new magazine devoted to exploring virtualspace and new
technologies. Wired is not as new edge as Mondo 2000 and seemingly gives
off a more corporate news oriented format. However, it is a refreshing
view and perhaps infonomics first steps into the public realm. (The TIME
magazine of virtual culture.)

Wirehead - a hardware hacker.

Zaibatsu - Japanese term used a lot by William Gibson that means a large
mega-corporation, such as Sony for example.

How To Get Into College
     by
Ian Osmond (AKA Xiphias Gladius, Esq.)

Getting into college these days is a competitive business.
Luckily, you're competing against people who have no clue
what they are doing.  Unluckily, neither do you.  So, with
the clue or two you may glean from this manuscript, you will
be ahead of the game.

     Colleges look at the following five things, which will
be dealt with in this paper in order of importance:
     A. Transcript
     B. SAT/ACT scores
     C. Teacher recommendations
     D. Essays
     E. Resume - a list of all the stuff you've done besides
          school

Section 1 - Transcript

     For those of you who don't recognize the term, this is
the official copy of your grades in High School.  ""What?"" you
cry?  "" thought those were practice grades!""  Never fear!
Your problem can be solved simply with a bobby pin, some
white-out and a ball-point pen!

     The locks on school file cabinets are rather pitiful.
Frankly, I've never successfully picked one, but I am a klutz
anyway, and need a professional lock-gun to pick my teeth.
Nonetheless, once you have your official transcript in your
sweaty little hands, your work is nearly done.

     My High School makes it easy.  Each year's grade record
is printed on a separate standard oversize mailing label.
The final GPA and class rank are printed on a standard normal
mailing label.  The printing is done with a nine-pin dot-
matrix printer on draft quality.  A student from Arlington
High merely needs to procure five mailing labels, re-print
his/her transcript, with the grades s/he INTENDED to get, re-
calculate and print his/her GPA, and put down a new,
reasonable, class rank.

Section 2 - SAT/ACT Scores

     The Scholastic Aptitude Test and the American College
Test are the two standard tests requested by colleges.  YOU
NEED TAKE ONLY ONE OF THESE!  Of the two, the ACT provides
the more accurate indicator of probable performance in
college, as it tests reading, math, deductive reasoning, and
science ability.  NOBODY in the Northeast takes the ACT.

     A really good score on the SAT is about 1100 - 1200, and
there are three ways to do this.  The first, and most highly
recommended, is to be a genius.  Failing that, take a lot of
expensive SAT preparatory courses.  The third method requires
some work.

     First, practice your guidance counselor's signature.
Second, steal one piece of his/her stationery.  Sign up to
take the SAT somewhere other than your school.  Bribe a local
genius to take the test for you.  Type a description of the
genius on the stationary, saying that the person of that
description is you, and sign it WITH THE GUIDANCE COUNSELOR'S
NAME.  This method has several advantages.  You get a better
score on the SAT, the genius gets extra pocket money and a
chance to practice taking the test, and, you don't have to
wake up early on a Saturday.


     Section 3 - Teacher Recommendations

     If no teacher really likes you a lot, try bribery, or
blackmail if you are getting short of cash.

     Section 4 - Essays

     Another cash-intensive area, there is much precedent for
bribery here, too.  Again, if you can't, merely pay someone
who can.  After all, when you get right down to it, isn't
that the basis of our economic system?  Really, that's the
foundation of Western Civilization, so how could it be wrong?

     Section 5 - Your Resume

     This section is weighted the least of the five major
areas, which is unfortunate, because, with a little work,
your resume can be spectacular!  It is worth your while to
turn in an outstanding resume, not only to get into college,
but also as practice for later life, in the business world.

     The major rule in college resume writing is: there is
nothing too insignificant, pointless, pitiful, or stupid to
put on a resume.  Hey, let's face it, colleges are pretty
much looking for length.  I'd like to give you a few examples
of things you could put on a college resume, with real-world
translations.

growth and expansion.

    As you can see, there is nothing which can't be phrased
in a positive manner! A few pointers on how to phrase things:
  1. Stick in the phrase ""independent research"" a lot.  You
     can do well with these words.
  2. Keep a thesaurus handy.  You don't want to use the exact
     same words too often.
  3. Colleges like stuff that shows leadership and maturity -
     aim for that in how you phrase stuff.
  4. Don't use profanity.
  5. Do use a spell-checker.  Nothing is more embarrassing to
     you and to the college than your claiming that you won a
     ""speling bee"".
  6. Get everything in BEFORE THE DEADLINE.

     I hope this paper has been useful to you, and good luck
to you as you go through the college application process.
Remember, many of the skills you will learn from this process
will be useful in later life, too!

                       BODYBUILDING MYTHS 
                     -----------------------
         extract from: ""GOLDS GYM book of bodybuilding""

At some point someone probably told you that working out with 
weights would make you muscle-bound or cause a woman to look like 
a man. Certainly, most good bodybuilders have been told that their 
muscles will turn to fat if they stop training.

There are six main ""muscle myths"" that must be exposed.  In each 
case we will discuss the myth and then reveal the truth underying 
it.  This process should dispel any remaining doubts you might 
have about becoming a body-buiding.

1.  BODYBUILDNG TRAINING WILL MAKE YOU MUSCLE-BOUND.  This is 
probably the most persistent muscle myth, and it suggests that 
working out with weights will make your body so tight and 
inflexible that you won't be able to scratch your own back or 
participate effectively in athletics.

Actually, scientists began investigating weight training and 
bodybuilding more than 30 years ago. They quickly discovered that 
weight workouts actually improve body flexibility.  Indeed, almost 
all bodybuilders  are far more flexible than the average person.  
Those who aren't have invariably been injured while 
participating in some other sport.  As an example, a shoulder 
separation incurred while playing football can easily limit 
shoulder flexibility and function.

Speaking of football, superstar Walter Payton of the Chicago Bears 
has used progressive resistance weight training to build massive 
arms and shoulders.  He can walk 50 yards on his hands, punishes 
anyone who tries to tackle him, and has never been seriously 
injured despite being near to the top of the NFL's ""hit list"" for 
several years.  He's flexible and then some!

2.  ALL OF YOUR MUSCLES WILL TURN TO FAT ONCE YOU STOP WORKING 
OUT.  It is physiologically impossible for muscle tissue to be 
converted to fat.  What actually happens when you suspend your 
weight workouts is that your muscles gradually atrophy, or shrink 
in size and strength.  This process takes about a year to run its 
course.

Then why are some former bodybuilders fat today?  The answer to 
this question is true for  ALL of the numerous athletes in any 
sport who have become fat after retiring from competition.  When 
you train virtually every day for several hours you regularly burn 
up relatively large quantities of calories.  As a result, you can 
consume more food than you can if you are physically inactive.  
But when you  suspend training you no longer burn up so many 
calories.  So, if you continue to eat the same amount as when you 
were working out every day, you will accumulate a caloric excess 
and gradually gain body fat.  The obvious solution to this problem 
is to decrease your caloric consumption to compensate for the 
calories you are no longer burning off in your workouts.  If you 
follow this advice, you will never grow fat after you cease heavy 
training with weights.

In actual practice, few bodybuilders ever stop training for very 
long.  As they grow older they don't train as intensely as when 
they were competing, but they still hit the gym almost every day.  
Once you have iron fever, you're usually hooked for life.

3.  BODYBUILDING WILL MAKE A WOMAN LOOK LIKE A MAN.  As noted in 
the foregoing section on men versus women, women don't secrete the 
same amounts of testosterone as do men.  Therefore, they simply 
can't develop a man's muscle mass and quality.  Additionally, a 
woman secretes large quantities of estrogen, which guarantees the 
integrity of her femininity.  Unless she makes the disastrous 
mistake of taking male hormones, no woman will look masculine as a 
result of her bodybuilding training.

4.  BODYBILDING TRAINING CAN STUNT YOUR GROWTH.  There are a 
somewhat disproportionate number of male and female competitive 
bodybuilders who are below the national average in height, leading 
some individuals to conclude that bodybuil
"
raza1@gmail.com,politics3.txt,"whether -- we heard yesterday that there a


    23    number of different epidemiologic studies going on. 

    24    And we did quiz the panel as to the comparability of

    25    those different studies and the ability to pool the


                                                                         48

     1    data from all of them.


     2                Certainly you've been looking at that

     3    issue and at the whole -- how scientific and solid the

     4    epidemiology is.  I wonder if you would comment upon

     5    that, and how you feel about the fact that there are


     6    multiple epidemiologic studies, and how comparable

     7    they are, and how well that agencies are really

     8    working together to make them more comparable.


     9                DR. KELSEY:  Well my -- chiefly what I

    10    would say is we've been provided protocols for many of

    11    the ongoing studies.  And we're looking at the

    12    questions that they specifically want to ask.


    13                It's obviously part of our mandate.  And

    14    I think we've urged that these things be done in a

    15    coordinated fashion, subject to peer review.  And I


    16    think that issue is important.

    17                And it's something we look at.  And

    18    obviously something very important for you to look at. 

    19    Beyond that I don't think I can comment on specifics.


    20                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  I guess part of my

    21    question is:  You made a series of recommendations. 

    22    And we clearly are going to have to look at whether


    23    your recommendations are being followed.  And if you

    24    have any insights or ideas at this point about how

    25    well -- or any suggestions for us as we look at that,


                                                                         49

     1    it would be helpful.


     2                DR. KELSEY:  Sure.  And I think we'd be

     3    happy to be in contact with the committee at any point

     4    as well.  For us, obviously, it's an ongoing process.

     5    And it's -- those questions are very important.  And


     6    we are actively searching for and asking for protocols

     7    and any information that you can provide.

     8                And I think the presence of this Committee


     9    has made a lot of information available to us more

    10    rapidly than it might otherwise have.  So it's been

    11    useful for us as well.  But I think that Dr. Mundt

    12    would be happy to provide anything that we have that


    13    you can use.

    14                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Thank you.

    15                Elaine?


    16                DR. LARSON:  It's pretty safe to say, I

    17    think, that the resulting -- could be acute

    18    musculoskeletal disease, stress, and infectious

    19    disease from the indigenous area.


    20                That's pretty safe.  And that is part of

    21    any war.  What's missing here is any specific comment

    22    about the testimony that we heard yesterday related to


    23    autoimmune symptoms and immune dysfunctions of various

    24    sorts.  And I assume that's what some people refer to

    25    as the Gulf War Syndrome.


                                                                         50

     1                You haven't commented that in your report. 


     2    Did you hear testimony on that?  Did you see evidence

     3    that that's being examined or looked for?

     4                DR. BURROW:  Well, I can only go back and

     5    repeat that the people who had complaints -- and they


     6    are listed -- were examined and if not satisfied by

     7    the physician, were again looked at.

     8                And what came out were specific diagnoses


     9    and not large numbers of any particular autoimmune

    10    disease or anything else.  So the -- that in that

    11    structure, nothing of this sort surfaced in any number

    12    that was different than one would expect.


    13                And by saying that, let me say there were

    14    people who had lupus arimethrotosis, but may have had

    15    it before.  I mean, if you examine that many people,


    16    you are going to get people with illnesses.  But there

    17    wasn't anything that was particularly out of the

    18    ordinary.

    19                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Dr. Custis?


    20                DR. CUSTIS:  In connection with Dr.

    21    Lashof's question, I wonder, Dr. Mundt, would you

    22    repeat your definition of the term ""coordinated


    23    effort?""

    24                DR. MUNDT:  I think that the term

    25    ""coordination"" is something that our committee


                                                                         51

     1    discussed at length.  And I believe that the committee


     2    has looked at coordination in terms of coordinate the

     3    activities and the interactions and the participation

     4    of the various agencies on particular projects.

     5                The word ""coordination"" -- it's become our


     6    understanding -- relates more to the knowledge of or

     7    the awareness of various activities.  So I think that

     8    the word ""coordination"" may need to be defined


     9    explicitly, both in terms of how our committee

    10    understands its use as well as how the various groups

    11    that we are dealing with are defining the word

    12    ""coordination.""


    13                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Would it be correct

    14    to say that we are talking about coordination and not

    15    integration, and maybe we need some more integration


    16    of the efforts?  Or not?

    17                DR. MUNDT:  That's really not my place to

    18    answer.

    19                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  That's our job, I


    20    guess.

    21                Any further questions for the --

    22                Yes?  Phil?


    23                DR. LANDRIGAN:  Karl -- for Dr. Kelsey --

    24    Karl, on page 12 of your report you make the very

    25    sensible recommendation that the VA and the DOD should


                                                                         52

     1    determine the specific research questions that need to


     2    be answered and should develop methodologies etc. to

     3    pursue those questions.

     4                It sort of follows up on Dr.

     5    Baldeschwieler's question.  Have you given any thought


     6    to what additional items ought to be on the list? 

     7    We've obviously heard about some:  depleted uranium,

     8    leishmaniasis, lead.  Any others that you would like


     9    to offer specifically?

    10                DR. KELSEY:  Well, I can comment that I

    11    think our mandate is broad.  And so that this second

    12    report will be much broader than the first.  This


    13    really was an attempt to direct hypothesis-driven work

    14    in the interim.  And to the extent that we've done

    15    that, we've accomplished our goal with that report.


    16                I can -- I can't give you specifics other

    17    than to tell you that clearly our second report will

    18    be much more broad and address other health

    19    consequences.


    20                DR. LANDRIGAN:  Yes.  We learned yesterday

    21    that there were -- there either has started or will

    22    shortly be starting in the state of Iowa an


    23    examination of 3,000 veterans, half of whom were

    24    deployed in combat areas, and half of whom were in the

    25    service at the same time, but not in combat areas.


                                                                         53

     1                And it seems like a nice start in that


     2    direction.  It would also be good, though, if that

     3    effort were energized by specific hypotheses before it

     4    began in fact.

     5                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Other --


     6                DR. KNOX:  I just have one more question

     7    as to whether you made a recommendation, maybe, about

     8    the predeployment physical, now that you've looked at


     9    exit physicals from being deployed?

    10                DR. BURROW:  Well, I think actually it's

    11    an -- if I understand the question -- it's an

    12    interesting -- because clearly, I mean, there was a


    13    war going on.  And it's a bad way to set up an

    14    experiment.

    15                But if, in fact, one really thought about


    16    this kind of thing before going in, there were ways in

    17    terms of unit identification -- who got vaccinated,

    18    when, medications that would be enormously helpful

    19    later.  So I think that's an area of interest.  We


    20    have not dealt with that.  But it certainly is an

    21    area.

    22                DR. KNOX:  One of the problems that I


    23    recognize -- when you look at this study and you look

    24    at the number of illnesses that the reserve components

    25    complained about, their physicals on active duty


                                                                         54

     1    reserve are only every four to five years unless they


     2    are over the age of 40.  So that may be some of the

     3    reason for the increased number of illnesses in that

     4    group.

     5                DR. BURROW:  Very good.


     6                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Art?

     7                DR. CAPLAN:  This is for Dr. Kelsey.  In

     8    your sort of overall examination of the issues -- one


     9    of the things that came up yesterday in the testimony

    10    we heard is that people face tremendous problems if

    11    they are discharged in terms of insurance coverage and

    12    follow-up.


    13                I just had two questions for you.  One,

    14    are you looking at all at the ability of the

    15    investigators to protect subject privacy and


    16    confidentiality in the various inquiries that are

    17    being made?

    18                And, two, are they doing a good job

    19    warning people about what may happen to them if they


    20    get identified as having a problem or syndrome or

    21    chronic condition that -- at discharge.

    22                In other words, are they -- can you make


    23    some recommendations not only about what's there, but

    24    about the protection of the subjects of the

    25    populations that are involved in some of these studies


                                                                         55

     1    since there clearly are consequences that aren't


     2    always beneficial if you are identified as being ill?

     3                DR. KELSEY:  An excellent point.  The

     4    overarching fragmentation of healthcare really does

     5    not lend itself to endeavors like the epidemiologic


     6    examination of this cohort of 700,000.  And I think

     7    insurance is but one of the many enormous problems.

     8                We have discussed at length -- and there


     9    is -- it's obviously important both for the individual

    10    patient and for caregiving, as well as for data

    11    gathering and integration of the resources so the

    12    economics of healthcare play a very big role here.


    13                In addition -- and that's from our

    14    standpoint.  It will come out in the report because

    15    that's a very important part of this.  The other issue


    16    of informed consent, if you will, for participating in

    17    studies is a concern.  And it's one that we have to

    18    take into account when we advocate linking records.

    19                It's, as you know, a complex problem.  At


    20    this point, I think we are advocating linking medical

    21    records and then dealing with these problems in the

    22    way that epidemiologists deal with medical records. 


    23    That's, I think, the model.  And that's what, at this

    24    point, we are really thinking about.

    25                Going beyond that would require,


                                                                         56

     1    certainly, a rethinking of how one deals with this


     2    data because it is a massive data base.  And to the

     3    extent that a massive data base is being put together

     4    with identifiers, that's a critical question.

     5                And it's further a critical question when


     6    you deal also with the armed services because their

     7    confidentiality has an entirely different meaning.  So

     8    I think your point is a good one.  It's one that we


     9    have thought a lot about.  It certainly will be in our

    10    report.

    11                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Are there any other

    12    questions?


    13                (No response.)

    14                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF: If not, I want to

    15    thank you all very much.  This has been helpful.  And


    16    there is no question that we will be in touch.  And

    17    our staff will be working closely with Kelley and

    18    Diane.  And any further suggestions you have for our

    19    work are certainly welcome.  Thank you very much.


    20                The committee would like to take a stretch

    21    just right here just for a couple minutes.

    22                (Whereupon, the proceedings went off the


    23                record at 10:14 a.m. and went back on the

    24                record at 10:22 a.m.)

    25                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Can I ask the


                                                                         57

     1    Committee to take their places again?


     2                Well, I think we've had a very thorough

     3    briefing now for a day and a half.  Now we have to

     4    face that task of deciding just what our job is and

     5    how we are going to do it.  And develop some type of


     6    time line for accomplishing our goal.

     7                What I'd like to do is start first with a

     8    discussion of the elements of the charter.  Each of us


     9    has reviewed the charter ourselves.  And each of us

    10    discussed it at the time we agreed to serve on this

    11    Committee.

    12                But we haven't had a chance to discuss it


    13    as a Committee, as a whole, and make sure that we all

    14    interpret the charter in the same way.  Or, if we have

    15    differences in views about the charter and our


    16    responsibilities, we need to air those and hopefully

    17    reach a consensus as to what we need do.

    18                If you'll turn in your briefing book to

    19    tab B -- the charter is in tab B.  And we might all


    20    just take a look at it at this point.  I think item C

    21    is clearly where we are at, at which the duties of the

    22    Committee are solely advisory.  That, I think we all


    23    understand.

    24                We have no implementing authority.  But I

    25    think the weight of our advice -- it will carry a


                                                                         58

     1    great deal of weight.  Let me put it that way.  I


     2    think there is no question that the President, the

     3    First Lady, the heads of the departments, are looking

     4    to us for advice.  And I think they will be

     5    responsive.


     6                The areas at which we are supposed to look

     7    are the research, which we have heard a fair amount

     8    about this morning; the coordination efforts we also


     9    discussed briefly and again this morning.

    10                We are to look at medical treatment.  In

    11    that regard we have heard primarily from the veterans

    12    and their families.  We are to look at the outreach


    13    issues, which we have had some brief questions about

    14    and have been touched on.

    15                And we are to look at the external reviews


    16    and the -- which really refer to the IOM and others

    17    and whether those have been implemented.  Look at the

    18    NIH reviews and the Health Technology Assessment

    19    reviews.


    20                We are to look at what possible risk

    21    factors.  We are again to look at the question of

    22    chemical and biological weapons.  My view of how we


    23    look at those -- well, how we look at them will be the

    24    subject of our major discussion.

    25                I think that really covers a broad range


                                                                         59

     1    and leaves out only one thing.  And I think it's


     2    important to note what it does leave out.  And it

     3    leaves out the issue of compensation.  It is not the

     4    responsibility of this Committee to look at issues of

     5    compensation.


     6                And it's also my understanding of the

     7    charge that as we look at each of these issues, we

     8    will not be undertaking any new research.  But rather,


     9    we will be reviewing everything that is ongoing and

    10    make recommendations about new research.

    11                But within a year and a half, which is the

    12    life of our Committee, it's clear that we could not


    13    launch new research activities in the traditional

    14    sense of research.

    15                Digging into and researching what has been


    16    done in that sense of research is obviously

    17    appropriate.  Listening and hearing and asking

    18    questions and searching, rather than researching, may

    19    be the way to put it.  Well, that's enough said from


    20    me.

    21                Let me ask any of the members of this

    22    group to raise any questions, feelings, their


    23    interpretations of the charter itself.

    24                Elaine?

    25                DR. LARSON:  Two comments.  First of all,


                                                                         60

     1    it -- one of the other things that is missing is any


     2    consideration about the sort of, if you will, ethical

     3    or social implications of all this and whether there

     4    are processes in terms of the way people were handled

     5    or treated that need to be considered.  And we might


     6    want to talk a little bit about whether we are

     7    interested in making any comments about that.

     8                Secondly, obviously, we were reminded


     9    several times yesterday that we are the fifth group --

    10    and there is a clear mood of discouragement if not

    11    questioning about whether any of these are going to be

    12    that useful.


    13                The first thing we've got to do is make

    14    some kind of a chart and figure out who has done what

    15    in each of these areas, collect the information,


    16    collect the committee reports.  That's a staff

    17    function.

    18                We have some of them.  I don't think we

    19    have all of the information.  And then see where it is


    20    that we really can have an oversight function and make

    21    some statements that will be of benefit.

    22                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  That's correct.


    23                Others?

    24                Art?

    25                DR. CAPLAN:  One of the things that has


                                                                         61

     1    come up a bit in our somewhat sparse comments -- but


     2    it's probably the time to bring it up now -- is I

     3    think it's not clear to me, although I know which way

     4    I lean about this, that it's part of our mandate to

     5    make suggestions about what Phil was talking about


     6    earlier, the future deployments, repeating the same

     7    problems in that we may want to say things about

     8    either research or structure or infrastructure that


     9    needs to be said.

    10                And I lean toward thinking that that would

    11    be important and should be part of what we are up to. 

    12    But it's not clear to me as I look at this that 


    13    anybody asked, so to speak.

    14                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  I think I can respond

    15    to that in the positive.  In my discussions with the


    16    National Security Council and the representatives of

    17    the Agency in assuming this role, that was one of the

    18    things that was stressed, that they do look to us to

    19    make recommendations as to how future issues of this


    20    kind can be addressed so that we don't find ourselves

    21    in this situation this long after a deployment of

    22    troops.


    23                Are there any other questions that come to

    24    mind on the Committee on just reading the charter

    25    itself and understanding what our responsibilities


                                                                         62

     1    are?


     2                (No response.)

     3                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  I suspect there is

     4    just one other thing that needs to be said to that. 

     5    And it's only fair to the veterans that they


     6    understand that.  We heard so much yesterday of their

     7    need to have answers.

     8                We are not in a position, probably, to


     9    give a definitive answer for all people's individual

    10    problems at the end of this time.  What we hope we

    11    will be able to do is to say whether or not the

    12    studies that are ongoing will provide those definitive


    13    answers.

    14                If studies that are ongoing during the

    15    course of our time give us answers, we certainly will


    16    act on that and state that.  But epidemiologic studies

    17    take time.  And what we must be sure of, I think, is

    18    that everything that should be done is being done. 

    19    Everything that can be done is being done.


    20                And if not, to identify those and

    21    recommend that they be done.  That is, I think, our

    22    final goal.  And we need to be clear to ourselves and


    23    to the community at large that that's our goal.

    24                Phil?

    25                DR. LANDRIGAN:  Yes.  I think in that


                                                                         63

     1    vein, we heard testimony yesterday from many veterans,


     2    their families, members of veterans' groups, laying

     3    out a long series of diseases and syndromes and

     4    symptoms that are bothering them.

     5                And we saw a similar list up on the slide


     6    a while ago during the IOM presentation.  It behooves

     7    us to look very carefully at that list and look at the

     8    minutes that will be provided us to make sure that


     9    we've got all the details of the testimony that was

    10    presented.

    11                And make sure, as you say, that each of

    12    these points is being addressed, at least to the


    13    extent it can be, by either the various committees

    14    that are already going on, the various studies that

    15    are underway.


    16                And if they are not, it -- I think it's

    17    our job to make suggestions as to how any gaps can be

    18    filled so that, indeed, no stone is unturned.

    19                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  All right.


    20                Art?

    21                DR. CAPLAN:  Just following up on the

    22    issue of coming up with the answers.


    23                I think you put it very well, Madam Chair,

    24    about our inability to answer some of these questions,

    25    that it's going to have to fall to those actually


                                                                         64

     1    doing the studies to answer some questions.


     2                But we did hear yesterday as part of the

     3    testimony claims about difficulties in getting

     4    physicals, chilling effect if one reported complaints,

     5    problems about fears of retribution, and what happened


     6    in terms of loss of benefits or coverage for people

     7    who are discharged and so forth.

     8                And I think it might be appropriate for us


     9    not again to try and solve every problem and

    10    difficulty that has come up, but at least to look at,

    11    again, structural means as part of the research to see

    12    that those sorts of things -- what's going on and what


    13    could be done to attend to some of that as well.  Not

    14    just, in other words, the biology, but some of these

    15    administrative problems that we hear about.


    16                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Andrea?

    17                DR. TAYLOR:  I guess I wanted to follow up

    18    with that as far as active duty versus those who have

    19    been discharged who are no longer in service --


    20    whether they are receiving the help that they need. 

    21    And I guess that was we heard over and over again.  We

    22    definitely have to address that.


    23                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  I think the last

    24    couple of remarks lead us right into the next things

    25    I wanted to take up as we run through, which is a


                                                                         65

     1    discussion of our first day and what issues came out


     2    that we feel are burning that we need to look at.

     3                But before I move on to that, let me ask

     4    whether there are any other questions or

     5    interpretations of the charter that anyone wants to


     6    make any further comments on before we move into --

     7    what I planned to do was -- the structure of our

     8    discussion this morning will be around, after the


     9    charter, to discuss the first day and what things came

    10    out and then to go systematically through what the

    11    thrust of our report will eventually look like.

    12                How we are going to go about -- staff,


    13    what kind of staff we are going to need, and then how

    14    the Committee and staff are going to function.  What

    15    will be staff functions, what kinds of things the


    16    Committee is going to have to address as a Committee,

    17    a whole, and some of the operational issues.

    18                And we -- I think that will follow

    19    naturally from this discussion.


    20                Anybody have any other suggestions about

    21    how we go about this task at this point?

    22                (No response.)


    23                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Okay.  If not, then

    24    let's launch into further discussion of issues that

    25    people feel came up yesterday that they want to


                                                                         66

     1    explore further, either by getting staff to get


     2    further information, or by further testimony at future

     3    times.  Whatever.

     4                Andrea?

     5                DR. TAYLOR:  I wrote down a few things. 


     6    I've heard a lot of information regarding chemical

     7    environmental exposure, or some.  I am interested --

     8    one of the persons who testified yesterday talked


     9    about the kerosene exposure, kerosene use.

    10                So I am really interested in following up

    11    on that as far as the contents of kerosene, what was

    12    being actually used at the point -- in the tents for


    13    heating -- whether that had any effect, along with

    14    some of the other issues around, the chemical warning

    15    signals that constantly went off.


    16                And although we've been told that there

    17    was no chemical warfare, then why would the chemical

    18    warning signals go off and react?  And people would be

    19    asked to don their equipment as well as take the


    20    tablets, the nerve tablets?

    21                And that's something that I think we have

    22    to investigate further, to make sure that the correct


    23    studies are being done.

    24                The other thing that came up -- and I am

    25    sure we've talked about it before -- is the mycoplasma


                                                                         67

     1    incognitas.  I think that's the name that we heard. 


     2    I've never heard of that before.

     3                And I think we need some more background

     4    information on that illness or disease.  Actually what

     5    it is.  Who is getting it.  How many people are


     6    affected.  And I think that's what I have.  And also

     7    the inoculations, whether that had any impact.  And we

     8    have had a lot of researching done on that.


     9                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Rolando?

    10                DR. RIOS:  That's one of the issues that

    11    came up to me yesterday -- that loomed in my mind

    12    yesterday -- is to try to establish the facts, what


    13    actually happened, what kind of elements were the

    14    troops actually exposed to.

    15                And I think that a significant part of our


    16    report should be where we address every claim and what

    17    the government's response to it is.  We have some

    18    pretty important group made up of citizens that

    19    believe that the Department is hiding something or --


    20    there is this kind of suspicion that is -- I think

    21    there is a broad perception that it's difficult to

    22    imagine that all this happened over there and that


    23    there was no exposure to chemical war agents.

    24                And I think that's why people are worrying

    25    that there must be something going on here, but the


                                                                         68

     1    government doesn't want to tell us.


     2                I do think that an important part of our

     3    report must address each claim and what the response

     4    of the government is, and what we have been able to

     5    determine -- whether or not we agree or whether or not


     6    we disagree, or whether or not we, you know, we can't

     7    conclude one way or the other.

     8                So we've got to address the issue of what


     9    are the facts, what were they exposed to.  Were

    10    chemical war agents there?  The government has agreed

    11    that they inoculated everybody.  So we know that they

    12    were exposed to that.


    13                We all know that there was a lot of

    14    kerosene, a lot of the fires from the wells.  That's

    15    there.  Those are facts that they admit to.  So I


    16    think that we do need to focus on what we can conclude

    17    insofar as what our troops were exposed to.

    18                And I think that's going to be an

    19    important part because it underlines a lot of the


    20    suspicions that people have about what the government

    21    is saying these days.

    22                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Andrea?


    23                DR. TAYLOR:  I just thought of one other

    24    thing regarding the chemical warning signals.  We need

    25    to know what kind of equipment was used, what was the


                                                                         69

     1    actual equipment, why it -- that was the one thing


     2    that I wanted to ask.

     3                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Elaine?

     4                DR. LARSON:  Well, first I have to make a

     5    comment about the signals going off.  That -- it


     6    doesn't bother me as much as I think it does other

     7    people.

     8                And that's probably because in the past,


     9    as a nurse I worked in critical care units where

    10    monitors are always going off because you have them

    11    set so that they go off for muscle movement and

    12    everything else just so that you will check.


    13                And it's very common in healthcare that

    14    you have monitors for everything, EKG's and I.V.

    15    lines.  And they're buzzing and sort of burping all


    16    the time.  But anyway, it is something.

    17                I think the main thing, again, is that

    18    we've got to get the facts straight.  Yesterday we

    19    heard conflicting information.  I don't know what's


    20    true.  There are some things that we can determine are

    21    true, and not true.

    22                And I think we may need some more hearings


    23    specifically about the infectious diseases, the

    24    microsporidium, the mycoplasma.  And leishmaniasis,

    25    and Q fever to a lesser extent because those are


                                                                         70

     1    expected.  And those are endemic in the area.  But


     2    particularly the new things.

     3                We may need some expert help in addition

     4    to what's on the panel with the chemical exposures and

     5    what the implications of that are.  What people were


     6    actually exposed to and what the implications are.  I

     7    think we need some expert help with the vaccine and

     8    the potential for the kinds of side effects or that as


     9    an exposure.

    10                And then we need someone to give us more

    11    information about teratogenicity and some of the

    12    congenital issues that came up yesterday.  That


    13    factual information we need.

    14                Lastly, I think we need to know what's

    15    actually lost and what -- by virtue of whatever you


    16    want to call it, inefficiency or whatever -- versus

    17    what is available in terms of data on who got what.

    18                And we may, again, want to make some

    19    recommendations on what data need to be kept in the


    20    future for long-term follow-up.

    21                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Phil?

    22                DR. LANDRIGAN:  No.


    23                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Any further comments

    24    from yesterday?

    25                Marguerite?


                                                                         71

     1                DR. KNOX:  I just have a couple of things. 


     2    I think it's very important, again, that we look at

     3    the predeployment physical that veterans have,

     4    especially for the Reserve and Guard components.

     5                Active duty army has a physical every


     6    year.  But that's not so.  And I think some of the

     7    that patients we saw with GI bleeds and myocardial

     8    infarcts during the war were because people were not


     9    screened well.  They really were not physically fit.

    10                The other thing is I want to comment on

    11    the VA system.  I think for the largest healthcare

    12    system available, that it is a very good one.  VA


    13    employees do their very best to meet the needs of

    14    veterans.  But because of federal funding, it is

    15    difficult.


    16                I will admit that the VA has problems with

    17    records because of the transfer from one facility to

    18    the other.  And that might be something that we could

    19    address to the VA for an administrative purpose.


    20                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Thank you.

    21                David?

    22                DR. HAMBURG:  Well, our colleagues have


    23    already raised a whole series of major questions that

    24    came up yesterday that we should clarify.  I certainly

    25    agree that getting the facts straight is the most


                                                                         72

     1    important task we have.


     2                I have to say, having been through many

     3    similar exercises on other subjects, that it's easy to

     4    say and very hard to do.  It's very complex.  We heard

     5    yesterday vivid and poignant and moving accounts of


     6    the suffering and the concerns and hope for our

     7    veterans and their families.

     8                And we have to take those very seriously


     9    into account, do everything in our power to see to it

    10    that those are matched up with the best available

    11    scientific and professional resources of the country. 

    12    And that will be our ongoing and fundamental task.


    13                But it is hard to do.  I think we mustn't

    14    be presumptuous.  That is, the extent to which we can

    15    mobilize the capacity throughout the country will be


    16    very important.  How much we an do ourselves, a

    17    relatively small group -- and these issues are very

    18    complicated.

    19                We will need to think not only about our


    20    own staff, about our own members, but I think -- how

    21    do we get, for example, people who are doing the best

    22    ongoing research on these thorny questions, either


    23    directly vis … vis the Persian Gulf War, or in other

    24    contexts, chemical agents and so on.

    25                There are a number of different sources of


                                                                         73

     1    information that we are going to have to try to tap


     2    quite systematically in the relatively short time

     3    available to us.  So I am not going to make

     4    suggestions about that at the moment.

     5                But I think, in effect, the mobilization


     6    of the relevant scientific and professional

     7    communities and the relevant knowledge bases is a

     8    really big job.  It's got to go way beyond what we and


     9    our staff will actually be able to do ourselves. 

    10    We'll have to stimulate a lot throughout the country.

    11                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Thank you.

    12                Don?  Any comments at this point?


    13                DR. CUSTIS:  I know it's difficult to deal

    14    with anecdotal information.  But on the other hand, it

    15    seems to me that we possibly could make some use of it


    16    by taking some samples, some examples of individuals

    17    who are suffering from certain illness and follow

    18    through, find out exactly what had been done for them,

    19    and perhaps what is left undone, on a sample basis. 


    20    I think to -- we can't afford to ignore some of this

    21    anecdotal information.

    22                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Okay.


    23                Art?

    24                DR. LARSON:  Joyce, could I just comment

    25    on that --


                                                                         74

     1                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Sure.


     2                DR. LARSON:  Because this is a technique

     3    that the Institute of Medicine uses with some success

     4    quite often.  And that is the case study approach. 

     5    Now there's, you know, pros and cons and ups and


     6    downs.

     7                But it's not a bad idea to look at some

     8    representative cases and follow through the system of,


     9    you know, sort of a systems approach to what happened

    10    to people.  And I don't think that that's been done in

    11    any way before.

    12                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Okay.  Let's save


    13    that for when we get into the actual discussion of how

    14    we are going to do the job.  Right now we are

    15    discussing what we need to cover, and then we will dig


    16    into exactly how we are going to go about doing it.

    17                Art?

    18                DR. CAPLAN:  One of the things that I

    19    think we ought to try and cover is something about how


    20    the response was mounted to this particular episode

    21    and the attempt to muster information.  I -- we have

    22    the outcomes, if you will, the four committee reports


    23    and so forth.

    24                But I'm interested in knowing literally as

    25    much as we can without turning it into a complete


                                                                         75

     1    history project.  But who asked for what when, how


     2    quickly, what sort of memos and requests went back and

     3    forth.  Because I think that would help us know what

     4    are options and what's, to follow David's suggestion,

     5    what's really practical.


     6                I mean, it may take a year to roll

     7    something forward or 18 months to get a study up and

     8    put our for peer review and so forth.  And that may


     9    just be a reality.

    10                But if you are looking at it from the

    11    point of view of someone who is ill and waiting for an

    12    answer, it looks like an obfuscation or a plot.


    13                And I think it's our -- in some sense our

    14    responsibility to get information so that we can

    15    explain to people why sometimes these responses take


    16    some time, and that's just going to be the way it is.

    17                So I'd like to see us at least be able to

    18    pull maybe some information about how we got to the

    19    reports that we have with memos or documents or


    20    whatever there is there.

    21                The two other things that I'd like some

    22    information on came up yesterday actually in the first


    23    panel testimony.  What are other countries doing?  And

    24    what were the illnesses there?  And discussions to the

    25    extent they've had them and so forth?  I'd just like


                                                                         76

     1    to find out what we can about that.


     2                And the third thing that occurred to me is

     3    I'd like to get some information about actually -- I

     4    guess what Marguerite is talking about -- what really

     5    is done in terms of base line and standard information


     6    collection.

     7                I don't know that everybody's physical is

     8    kept in a giant megacomputer somewhere.  So what is it


     9    that's -- what do we know, as we begin the process of

    10    sending troops into war, about their health status?

    11                What do we know about the indigenous risks

    12    that are believed to be out in any area, from


    13    intelligence reports or whatever it's going to be?  So

    14    what do we know when we start?

    15                And then maybe we can say something


    16    interesting about what we might want to try to learn 

    17    next time when we start.

    18                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Fine.

    19                John, do you have anything at this point?


    20                DR. BALDESCHWIELER:  On the basis of

    21    yesterday's presentations, I would again recommend

    22    that we consider carefully two specific things.  One,


    23    the mycoplasma incognitas, and the microsporidial

    24    species that were mentioned.  It seems to me that

    25    those are specific things that we can follow up on. 


                                                                         77

     1    And that would be a good use of our staff.


     2                Also, one other specific issue.  I must

     3    say I found the descriptions of the environmental

     4    exposures unconvincing, and particularly the exposure

     5    to the plumes from the oil well fires.  It seems to me


     6    that there is an enormous amount of release of toxic

     7    material in those plumes.

     8                And what I thought I heard was that the


     9    analysis of serum levels of specific hydrocarbons was

    10    used as the measure.  It seems to me this may miss an

    11    important point.  It meant, in particular, the -- it

    12    seems to me the major risk is from particulates with


    13    carcinogens that are potentially condensed on them.

    14                And so it may be that the most important

    15    effects of exposure are yet to come in the sense of


    16    long-term, long-latency carcinogens.  So it seems to

    17    me that's an important one to follow up on.

    18                Other observations from the presentations

    19    -- it seems to me that the reports on the performance


    20    of the VA system are very uneven.  And long waits,

    21    lost records, and so forth.

    22                And here I think the case study approach


    23    should be very useful, as I think tracking down, you

    24    know, what happened in a few individual cases will be

    25    very useful.  We may find that some hospitals perform


                                                                         78

     1    very well, others do not.  And all of that would be


     2    useful input.

     3                Finally, it seems to me that it's

     4    essential to get some sort of credible background

     5    measures of incidents of symptoms of the kinds that


     6    we've -- that have been reported.  Background measures

     7    from control groups that are really as comparable as

     8    they can be made.


     9                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Thank you.

    10                Okay.  Well, I think all of those are good

    11    points of things we need to follow up.  If we look

    12    specifically at the headings in the charter, it might


    13    be one way to try to look at the broad areas of

    14    inquiry and look at what kind of staffing and what

    15    kind of efforts we want to carry out.


    16                I mean, the first thing we were to look at

    17    was the research.  And it's clear that we are going --

    18    I mean, we have in our binder the research plan of the

    19    -- pulled together by the VA and DOD and HHS.  At


    20    least all signed off on it.  It's a fairly extensive

    21    research plan.

    22                I think there's no question that we need


    23    to do an in-depth -- we need staff to do an in-depth

    24    review of that research plan, to understand its

    25    status, to look at how comparable the various -- the


                                                                         79

     1    issues I raised about comparability of that area.  I


     2    think that's a lot of staff work that needs to go on.

     3                I guess one of the questions for us is how

     4    do we as a Committee address that versus what we have

     5    staff try to do and what things you would like to have


     6    further Committee meetings specifically address?

     7                Phil?

     8                DR. LANDRIGAN:  Yes.  I think there's a


     9    basic principle here.  And it was enunciated by the

    10    folks from the IOM this morning.  And I'd like to

    11    underscore it.  And that is that the results of the

    12    various registries that were presented to us yesterday


    13    by DOD and VA are nothing more than that.  They are

    14    registries.

    15                In other words, these are tabulations of


    16    symptoms in a lot of people, but a relatively small

    17    and self-selected fraction of the total population

    18    who, for whatever reason, have come forward.  There is

    19    no -- nobody concedes for a moment that these -- that


    20    these registries constitute prospectively designed

    21    hypothesis-driven epidemiologic studies.

    22                So I think that we have to distinguish


    23    carefully between the results of those registries

    24    which throw up clues, but are really almost totally

    25    unequipped to answer definitive questions.


                                                                         80

     1                We must distinguish those from true


     2    epidemiologic studies such as the one we were told is

     3    about to be undertaken in Iowa, where a serious effort

     4    is going to be made to compare exposed and unexposed.

     5                I don't know if that's a perfect study or


     6    not.  I simply haven't seen the protocols.  I have

     7    heard that some folks have concerns about it.  I don't

     8    know those concerns.


     9                But I think those are issues that we need

    10    to keep clear as we proceed, as we develop lists of

    11    exposures that we think ought to be subjected to

    12    epidemiologic study.


    13                We have to do the testing of those

    14    exposures in properly designed epidemiologic

    15    protocols, and not merely rely upon the registries to


    16    throw out the answers.

    17                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Any further -- I

    18    agree.  And I want to caution us -- further thoughts

    19    about how we go about evaluating the ongoing research


    20    projects and whether, since the key question we'll

    21    have to address is:  Are these research projects ones

    22    that will give the answers?  Are there new research


    23    projects that need to be done?

    24                Certainly we need a lot more briefing from

    25    staff.  This book is pretty extensive.  And I don't


                                                                         81

     1    know how many of you were able to go through the


     2    reports in it.  But we need to do that.  But there are

     3    lots more reports that we didn't put in the book that

     4    we need yet to digest.

     5                Marguerite?


     6                DR. KNOX:  Apparently Dr. Brix was under

     7    the impression that the information already existed

     8    about the patterning and aggregating of certain


     9    diagnosed diseases and the undiagnosed illnesses in

    10    the Gulf War Veterans that were not mentioned in the

    11    DOD report.  And so maybe that would be easily

    12    obtainable as well.


    13                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  David, you raised a

    14    lot of questions about the psychological stressors. 

    15    Do you have recommendations about -- in this -- under


    16    the heading of research, if you will, how we might

    17    address learning more about what we need to know on

    18    this score.

    19                DR. HAMBURG:  Well, operationally we


    20    probably need someone on staff who is a specialist in

    21    that area.  I understand that there are bound to be

    22    concerns that stress will not be treated in a proper


    23    scientific and rigorously medical public health way,

    24    but rather as a way of dismissing the difficulties

    25    that veterans and their families have.


                                                                         82

     1                At the extreme, and some times past, there


     2    has been -- had the implication that well, there is

     3    just a kind of malingering.  You know, it's kind of

     4    made up.  It's invented.  It's not real, etc.

     5                And that of course is a depreciatory


     6    stance which evades responsibility on the part of the

     7    officials or institutions who are coping with the

     8    problem.  That is not what I am talking about.


     9                There is a very serious question of how

    10    severe stress affects the endocrine system, for

    11    example, the cardiovascular system, possibly the

    12    immune system, and so on.  It's a very extensive body


    13    of research over about half a century which has been

    14    coming to fruition in the past decade.

    15                And I think it just simply has to be taken


    16    into account.  And it's one of the technical areas we

    17    need to cover, being mindful of the distortion to

    18    which that area is always susceptible as a kind of a

    19    cavalier dismissal of serious problems, which is


    20    obviously not the way in which we would treat it.

    21                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  In that regard

    22    certainly we would want to add someone on staff. 


    23    Would you see that as an issue that we ought to have

    24    some further panel and hearing about?  Bringing in

    25    some experts in that field?


                                                                         83

     1                DR. HAMBURG:  Well --


     2                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  We can wait on

     3    deciding that.  But --

     4                DR. HAMBURG:  To the extent we -- it's

     5    part of a part of a kind of systematic even coverage


     6    of major problem areas.  I wouldn't give it a higher

     7    standing with let's say the sorting out of possible

     8    chemical agents.  But it's in that same ballpark.


     9                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  In the same category?

    10                DR. HAMBURG:  Yes.

    11                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Fine.

    12                Don?  Any further thoughts on this aspect?


    13                DR. CUSTIS:  I think you've pretty well

    14    covered it.

    15                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Art?


    16                DR. CAPLAN:  One set of information that

    17    I think it might be useful to have -- I don't know

    18    that everybody has to get it -- but clearly for many

    19    of these protocols, when we heard testimony yesterday


    20    there were claims made about nonstandardization or

    21    incomplete interview things.

    22                We have been asking about standardization


    23    for information.  I would just like to see us

    24    archivally get some staff person who could read,

    25    store, collate, tell us what's in the basic protocol


                                                                         84

     1    documents.  We need somebody who is savvy to be able


     2    to read them and call them up and just tell us whether

     3    they look comparable or not, or incomplete or even

     4    incomprehensible, Lord only knows.

     5                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Fair enough.


     6                John?

     7                DR. BALDESCHWIELER:  One additional

     8    thought.  There has been so much previous work and


     9    layers of study and analysis upon study and analysis. 

    10    And I think we saw some of the problem this morning.

    11                That is the distinctions between what was

    12    literally in the IOM and DOD reports and what was said


    13    about what was in the DOD and IOM reports and those

    14    seem to be completely orthogonal sets of statements. 

    15    And so, you know, I think we will have to play some


    16    role in sorting all of this out.

    17                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  I think that's a very

    18    important point.  It was an issue that was raised with

    19    me early by the White House group -- is the importance


    20    of our thinking through how we communicate with the

    21    public about the issues as we do our work, not just at

    22    the end when we have a report, but as we go along to


    23    be sure that we think through what's the best means of

    24    communication beside being on C-SPAN or the newspaper

    25    articles, what we want to do in a more proactive way


                                                                         85

     1    ourselves.  And that's an issue we'll take up.


     2                All right.  Well, from that I would say

     3    that, you know, in the research area we would

     4    certainly want on staff epidemiologic expertise and

     5    environmental risk assessment expertise.


     6                I think, John, you've raised a lot of

     7    questions about the environmental risk.  There has

     8    been at least one fairly scientific or technical study


     9    on risk assessment that I don't pretend that I have

    10    completely digested, or frankly, completely

    11    understood.

    12                But I think we do need some people to do


    13    that and obviously I would look to -- the members of

    14    the committee have different expertise.  I would hope

    15    they would concentrate their efforts in that area and


    16    take a look at that and make specific recommendations

    17    to staff.

    18                And if they can help us identify not only

    19    people to put on staff, but consultants that we could


    20    call in, people that -- the contracts that we might be

    21    able to give for consulting efforts.  We can go both

    22    ways.  We have funding for staff as well as for


    23    consultants.  And we can commission reports to us

    24    analyzing reports, if you will.

    25                Don?


                                                                         86

     1                DR. CUSTIS:  You know, it occurs to me


     2    that the statements that were made that the people who

     3    put out the fires that were complaining of no illness

     4    -- in what depths that has been pursued.

     5                That category of people remind me of the


     6    ranch handers in the Agent Orange group who were in,

     7    you know, were studied with some intensity.  I would

     8    think that the people who put out the fires would be


     9    a very important source of information.

    10                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Okay.

    11                DR. LANDRIGAN:  May I --

    12                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Yes.  Sure.


    13                DR. LANDRIGAN:  I think that's an

    14    excellent suggestion.  And it sort of goes back to

    15    what I was talking about yesterday, with the need to


    16    use our common sense, our instinct, and our ears to

    17    find subgroups within this enormous population of

    18    700,000 people who might have had particularly intense

    19    exposures.


    20                And sometimes it's much more fruitful to

    21    look at a few hundred people who are heavily exposed

    22    than many thousands who were minimally exposed.  And


    23    I wonder if there is some systematic way that we can

    24    seek to learn about such groups.

    25                There is usually somebody who knows about


                                                                         87

     1    those groups, but you have to find that somebody.  And


     2    that might be worth some thought.  It's a detective

     3    process.

     4                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Okay.  I think that

     5    would be a good detective process for one of the staff


     6    people.  It's also one of the reasons that I raised

     7    the question of how much longer it's going to take

     8    them to do that geographic identification.  I really


     9    don't understand why this long after, we don't know

    10    who was where, and when.

    11                All right.  Let's move into the clinical

    12    care area.  It's obviously a major issue that came up


    13    from yesterday and how we might tackle looking at the

    14    clinical care.

    15                One is to consider one of our panel future


    16    meetings -- be a panel of physicians who have been

    17    caring for veterans, both at the VA and some of the

    18    other sources of care that veterans have sought out. 

    19    But I am open to any idea and suggestions along that


    20    line.

    21                Elaine?

    22                DR. LARSON:  Here I think Don's suggestion


    23    about case studies is relevant.  And if we are going

    24    to do panels, I'd like to see not just physicians

    25    there, but also -- there's no such thing as a typical


                                                                         88

     1    patient, but somebody who's been a client in the


     2    system and perhaps some of the nurses as well because

     3    there's a different perspective from those delivering

     4    care, outpatient care in the system.

     5                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Marguerite?


     6                DR. KNOX:  I think it might be beneficial

     7    for the panel as well to get some kind of

     8    understanding about how the VA works.


     9                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Yes.

    10                DR. KNOX:  Any Gulf War Veteran or any

    11    veteran of any kind can go into the VA system for an

    12    emergency.  If you are not a service-connected


    13    veteran, not just coming for a physical, the rules and

    14    regulations are very different.

    15                So I think it would behoove us to educate


    16    ourselves, those of us that are not as familiar to

    17    know what the differences in that care is.

    18                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Okay.  Fine.

    19                DR. RIOS:  I know that I have been


    20    contacted by a couple of doctors in Texas who have

    21    some Gulf War Veterans who are their patients and have 

    22    indicated that they would like to present information


    23    to this Committee by way of a panel --

    24                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Yes.

    25                DR. RIOS:  With their patients and give


                                                                         89

     1    you their perspectives.  And I think that would be


     2    worthwhile.

     3                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Okay.  You give that

     4    kind of detailed information to staff.

     5                Art?


     6                DR. CAPLAN:  That might be a good

     7    opportunity for the Committee to maybe think about

     8    going to the VA and doing it there.


     9                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Yes.

    10                DR. CAPLAN:  My school has a -- at Penn.

    11    there is a pretty extensive program now on

    12    rehabilitation.  And they are interested -- made an


    13    offer that maybe we might want to come and both listen

    14    and look.

    15                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Okay.


    16                David?

    17                DR. HAMBURG:  The VA system is not the

    18    whole story by any means.  But it is an important part

    19    of this.  And so there are at least two things that


    20    occur to me that might be a useful way for us to get

    21    an overview.

    22                One is that there have been periodic


    23    really major reviews of the VA care system by one or

    24    another part of the National Academy of Sciences.  I

    25    don't know if there has been a recent one in the past


                                                                         90

     1    few years.  Some of them in the period of 15 or so


     2    years ago were really well done, very thoroughly done,

     3    enough that they created some flurry of resistance in

     4    various circles.  But if there is a recent one, we

     5    ought to find that out.


     6                Secondly, Dr. Kizer, who appeared here

     7    yesterday, has been given, I think, the lead role in

     8    pushing a major extensive reform.  And we probably


     9    should find out about that insofar as it's likely to

    10    affect Gulf War Veterans and their families and maybe

    11    many aspects that go far beyond that.

    12                Obviously there will be.  But at least


    13    that -- how it would impinge would -- for example,

    14    it's conceivable that a reform which in general would

    15    be very invigorating for the VA might have some


    16    adverse side-effects for Gulf War Veterans.  I haven't

    17    the foggiest idea.  But I think since that is

    18    perceived at the moment as a major undertaking, we

    19    ought to learn what is the nature of that reform.


    20                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Okay.

    21                DR. LARSON:  Joyce, obviously --

    22                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Yes, Elaine?


    23                DR. LARSON:  It goes without saying that

    24    we want to do an analogous thing on the active duty

    25    side.


                                                                         91

     1                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Pardon?


     2                DR. LARSON:  I think we want to do an

     3    analogous effort on the active duty side as well.

     4                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Yes.

     5                DR. LARSON:  In terms of medical care.


     6                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  The DOD is also -- I

     7    think Steve Joseph has been ordered to do -- or,

     8    ordered is probably the incorrect term, but is


     9    undertaking a review of the total medical service at

    10    DOD and looking at whether that needs to be

    11    reorganized or not.  And so I think we can get an

    12    update.


    13                I think we have to be careful we don't get

    14    into too broad in those areas and confine it to the

    15    issue, as you point out, that what will be the impact


    16    of how they are looking at on the Gulf War Veteran and

    17    not try to put ourselves as another panel to critique

    18    the reevaluation in the VA and the DOD, but focus on

    19    that in relation to the Gulf War Veterans.


    20                Any other thoughts about the clinical

    21    care, diagnostic treatment?  I think we need to know

    22    more about the VA registry.  I mean, we've gotten this


    23    detailed report on the DOD registry.

    24                But we don't know whether the data are

    25    similar for the VA registry yet and how soon that data


                                                                         92

     1    will be available.  And to understand how those


     2    examinations are being done, I think we need more on

     3    that.

     4                DR. BALDESCHWIELER:  In the spirit of the

     5    case study, it might be interesting to try phoning


     6    some of the 800 numbers and see --

     7                (Laughter.)

     8                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  To see what happens


     9    when you call.

    10                DR. BALDESCHWIELER:  To se what really

    11    happens.

    12                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  All right.  Well, one


    13    thing we could certainly do is have staff supply all

    14    the Committee members with 800 numbers and ask every

    15    one of us to make a few calls and find out what


    16    happens.

    17                DR. BALDESCHWIELER:  As an

    18    experimentalist, I think this is often very

    19    illuminating.


    20                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  That'll be our own

    21    original research.

    22                DR. LARSON:  Actually I was going to do


    23    that last night.  But I ran out of time.  Seriously.

    24                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Okay.  Outreach is

    25    another area.  I mean, I'm sort of running down our


                                                                         93

     1    charter area as you can see.  Outreach was the next --


     2    certainly the panel we heard yesterday was our first

     3    effort at outreach.

     4                And Tom McDaniels, who was at my side

     5    during that, is the staff person -- we've brought


     6    aboard staff to work on the outreach -- and was

     7    instrumental in contacting and getting that group up. 

     8    We have to admit that, you know, he has not been on


     9    board very long.

    10                And we weren't able to do the kind of

    11    outreach we ought to be able to do in the future.  For

    12    our very first meeting, we had to pull this one


    13    together very quickly.

    14                DR. RIOS:  Along those lines, are we

    15    planning to have hearings out in the field?

raza1@gmail.com,science7.txt,"e was nevertheless unable
to have the results published in the scientific media of America.

Things are even worse when it comes to experiments conducted abroad, which
often tend to confirm disregarded experimental results on this continent,
as we shall see shortly.  To highlight the wide discrepancies between
orthodox (and obsolete) dogmas and actual, physical realities pertaining to
the true subatomic structures as we know them to be today, let us briefly
review the structures of the matter:

A molecule is the smallest division of a substance.  Further division would
cause it to cease being a substance.  The smallest true molecules can be
illustrated when we use the globe of the Earth for our standard.  If a
single drop of water were magnified until it was as big as the Earth, each
molecule would be about the size of a tennis ball.

On the next step down, an atom is the unit which makes up the nature of the
molecule, consisting of the nucleus and the surrounding electrons to render
the atom ""stable"".  An atom of hydrogen contains one proton and one
electron to balance or neutralize the proton.  Matter then is divisible
into electrons and protons.  But - and here comes the rub: Between
electrons and protons are spaces so vast, in comparison with the masses of
each, that, if the proton in the carbon atom were the size of a golf ball
hanging from a ceiling of the great hall at Pennsylvania Station in New
York, its electrons would be represented by six small wasps winging in a
little knot against the four walls of the gigantic structure of the
building!  In effect, one could claim there is a little final solidity of
substance to anything: The Universe consists of ""emptiness""' charged with
electrical energy!  If we translate the above to the measurements and
terminology of the physicist and ""magnify"" the atom mathematically, with
all its distances and dimensions kept in proportion so that the orbit of
the electron would have a diameter equal to that of the Earth about the
Sun, approximately 184 million miles, the diameter of the electron itself
would only be 2000 miles, and the diameter of the nucleus, where mass and
weight of the atom are truly concentrated, can be taken as 2 miles only.
We thus obtain a picture of a central mass with a diameter of 2 miles
(nucleus), another object with a diameter of 2000 miles (the electron in
the case of the hydrogen atom) at a distance of 92 million miles away from
it, orbiting the nucleus.  Evidently, there is plenty of room inside this
system.  And ""room"" is not a vacuum, it is not nothingness, but space
itself, spatial energy, a field which can be identified with the ether of
the past - and the future.  Nobel prize winner, Max Planck, during a
lecture in Florence, Italy, once made a truly remarkable statement which
describes the problem facing the physicist today:

     ""As a man who has devoted his whole life to the most clear-
     headed science, to the study of matter, I can tell you as
     the result of my research about the atoms this much:
     'THERE IS NO MATTER AS SUCH!""
     All matter originates and exists only by virtue of a force which
     brings the particles of an atom to vibration and holds this
     most minute solar system of the atom together.  We must
     assume behind this force the existence of a conscious and intelligent
     mind.  This mind is the matrix of all matter"".

This cosmic matrix is needed if we want to explain ""action at a
difference""' lines of force, stresses, a magnetic field and so on.  When
the concept of the ether was abandoned, it had to be replaced by the
concept of ""space"" instead.  In reality, we merely switched terminology.
We used to say that ""ether fills all space"".  But ""filling"" is no exactly
the descriptive word to use.  Perhaps we should rather define it: ""Ether is
a condition of space in which electrical manifestations for the atomic
construction of material is possible"".  This primordial energy is ""free"" or
in an uncondensed state.  It exists in interstellar space but remains
unrecognizable until it begins to coagulate or gets into a vortex pattern.

The claim of our textbooks that the Michelson-Morley experiment ""disproved""
the existence of the ether is incorrect.  It merely disproved the existence
of a noticeable ether ""drift"" or ""drag"".  As an analogy, if someone would
postulate that the absence of wind disproves the existence of the
atmosphere around our planet, the fallacy of this postulate would be
immediatly apparent to all.

""Michelson and Morley centered their attention on the Earth's orbital
velocity (30 km per second).  They had no knowledge of the existence of
galaxies; of motions of galaxies in relation to each other; of the motion
of our solar system in our galaxy....  Their negative results are
explainable on the basis of pre-1900 classical mechanics, so provide no
proof of the absence of ether or Louis de Broglie's 'subquantic medium'.
Thus, the limited information to Michelson and Einstein is emphasized by
recent findings, particularly in astrophysic"", writes Dr. H.C. Dudley in
the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, Jan, 1975, under the title
""Michelson's Hunch Was Right"".  And Dr. Dudley continues: ""In fact, 1929
saw Michelson still attempting to experimentally demonstrate the ether,
which his intuition and reasoning told him ought to be present"".

""Today most persons are largely unaware that the ether concept began to be
seriously reexamined by two of physics most notable laureates.  The ether
is now being called the ""neutrino sea"" by astrophysicists, and has been
characterized as an energy-rich particulate, subquantic medium.  A rather
voluminous literature on the subject is accumulating as indicated by a
recent review, The Cosmic Neutrino, with 655 references covering only the
period 1965-1972.....  It appears that an open-minded reexamination of this
area of physics is long overdue in order to open up new avenues of
approaching to this pressing problem.

Michelson, Dirac, de Broglie were not the only Nobel prize winners in favor
of a reexamination of the ether question.  Others were Stark, Arrhenius,
A.H. Compton, Lenard, H. Yukawa, and Fredrick Soddy, the British scientist
who, during the convention of Nobel laureates in Lindau, 1954, described
the current dogmas in physics as ""an orgy of amateur physics"" and ""arrogant
swindle"" - with particular emphasis on the theory of relativity.

It remained largely unknown, even to physicists, that Einstien himself had
serious doubts.  In 1949, he wrote to his old friend, Maurice Solovine, who
congratulated him on his 70th birthday:

     ""Now you think that I am looking back at my life's work with calm
     satisfaction.  But, on closer look, it is quite different.  There is
     not a single concept of which I am convinced that it will stand firm
     and I am not sure if I was on the right track after all"".

And one of my Canadian friends I believe is present here today stated quite
correctly in a letter to me:

     ""The myths around Einstien are really not of his making as he
     himself often questioned his own conclusions and I felt he was
     quite aware of his own limitations which others were covering up.
     The Physicists protect their members much the same way
     that the medical profession protects its own"".

The purpose of these remarks is not to spark another controversy about the
merits of the theories of relativity.  Rather, they want to show that so-
called ""scientific evidence"" is a rather elastic term and that
""verification"" is always a relative affair.  Or as K.R. Popper so aptly
put it:  ""Only in our subjective experience of conviction, in our
subjective faith, can we be `absolutely certain`"".

This symposium presents an excellent overview of research and experiments
reported from English speaking countries, or experiments published in the
English language, as for instance Japan.  However, as Dr. Tenhaeff from
Holland has formulated the problem:

     ""It is important to pay attention to publications of colleagues
     in other countries.  In the Netherlands and Germany, every
     academically educated man or woman know at least three foreign
     languages.  English and American authors only pay attention to
     material in English.  In my opinion, this leads to an `impoverishment'
     which puts a drag in science.  Some seem very chauvinistic and seem to
     believe that only the researches done in their country are important.
     I regret this.  Science is international, and international
     cooperation is of the greatest importance in science"".


In presenting some brief reports from abroad, I shall attempt to bring
corroborative evidence in support of alternative technology developments
discussed during our meeting here in Toronto.  Let me start with the most
sensitive and secretive society, with Russia.

Cause it's good enough for me!            But it's good enough for me!

Brother Jerry is a cretin             Brother Oral's in his tower,
But with all the cash he's gettin'    Trusting in the Lord's power
Lotsa folks'll be forgettin           Getting richer by the hour,
It's the ""Land of the Free!""          Now he's got the ransom fee!

Brother Robert's church is Crystal     Brother Earnest is a healer
But all the Bible that he's missed'll  And not QUITE a wheeler-dealer --
Make you ""hotter than a pistol""        More a jumper and a squealer
But he's good enough for me!           So he's good enough for me!

Brother Jim and Sister Tammy       Then there's good ol' Brother Billy
Had a show that was a whammy       Bringing souls in willy-nilly.
But now they are in Miami          All his trips are kinda silly,
Tryin' t'get back on TV!           But he's good enough for me!

Let us read works of Confucius         We will worship Xipe-Totec   
As we walk thru Massachusetts          Tho it is a little lo-tek *   
In white robes that freeze our tushes  It is not a bit ero-tek (erotic)   
But it's good enough for me!           But it's good enough for me!
   
                                            * ""low-tech(nology)

We will worship Xochipilli         And the Romans said of Jesus 
Though it might be a bit silly     ""Lets kill him, he don't please us"" 
Running naked makes me chilly      ""But the Atheists will tease us"" 
But it's good enough for me!       And thats good enough for me 

You could join Jehovah's Witness             
Running door to door for fitness
Well if you've been blessed with quickness,
Then thats good enough for me

We used to study old Confucius      And let's not forget Pelagius
As we sat there on our tushes       Though some call him outrageous
We're learning but don't push us    He is pious and courageous
And thats good enough for me        And he's good enough for me!

It's the opera written for us
We will all join in the chorus
It's the opera about Boris
Which is Godunov for me!

   Vissevald and his Lady Mara
   Danced ""La Volta"" through the night;
   He drank too deep of Imperium Compound,
   And she's now a satellite!                             (16)

   Gavin Kilkenny asked ""Is there any-
   One who would dispute my rightful Throne?
   I'll take a double Imperium Compound,
   For it seems I have a clone!""                          (16)

   AElfwine the Saxon, whose family's flaxen
   Whose courtesy is all the Northland's pride;
   Mixes his mead now with Imperium Compound
   Often a bridesmaid, now a bride!                       (16)

   Siegfried, thrice King, showed us a new thing
   When fighting for the Eastern Crown:
   He took a swig of Imperium Compound
   And proved you CAN win from one-down!                  (16)

   Richard of Mont Roy-al, the Short he
   Is very fast and very hard to kill;
   As tall as Frodo, or his dog, Odo,
   But he kisses Froggies with a will!                     (5)

   Duke Sir Deaton, was never beaten
   On the field, or in the drinking hall;
   At the Catbox War with Caid,
   Left thirty bodies piled against the wall!              (5)

   Denis O'Titans was good at smitin'
   A Locksley Monster in every single way!
   Drank a little Imperium Compound
   And ATE Deaton's sword that day  // No! REALLY! //       (5)

   Wotan the Mongoloid, a little bit paranoid,
   But a nice guy none the less;
   Drank a mess of Imperium Compound

   Then there's Duke Reynard, with a face like a St. Bernard
   Of the Dukes, he is the homliest
   He tends to toke up on Imperium Compound
   And go out and whomp on anybody's best!                   

   Oh, Ebenezer, thought he was Julius Caesar
   So they put him in the Funny Home.
   Then they gave him Imperium Compound,
   Now he's Emperor of Rome.
                 
   AltChorus: Oh let's drink a drink, a drink, a drink,  
              To Lily the Pink, the Pink, the Pink,
              The savior of the human ra-aa-ace.
              She invented Imperium Compound,
              Most effacatious in evr'y case.

   There was Horic, We thought he was sick,
   As a War-Puppy he was insane,
   Gave up Tranya for Imperium Compound,
   Now we have an Acid Reign!            //Oh wow, man!//   (18)

   This song'll bedevil the folks at a revel,
   And most of the time it will annoy the King,
   So take a drink of Imperium Compound
   And let's go Royalty-bedeviling!                         (5)

   Duchess Anna is quite a fan-a

   Lyn of Whitewolfe, made of the right stuff,

   Duke Sir Brion, and Duke Sir Trelon,
   Won the Crown with regularity;

   Stephan von Geist, was most awful nice,

   All the Crusadenes were big, but not mean,

   Good Duke Arthur couldn't get no farth-er

   Then King Richard, a bit of a bitch, heard
   A King's Crown could be done.

   There was Astra, no one ever asked her

   There's good old Igor, his prowess is meager

   Then there's Dagan, his brother's the Ka-Khan,
   Which is quite funny in a King!
   If he gets hooked on Imperium Compound

   Fredrick of Holland, who dwells in the Northland,
   A Master from the West, he came!
   Spends all his money for Imperium Compound
   That's why his garb's always the same!                   (20)

   Now Gyrth Oldcastle, round as a beer barrel,
   Once chose to quarrel with a certain Bard;
   The poet served him with Imperium Compound,
   And left him rendered down to lard!                      (20)

   Many tales abound of Imperium Compound
   And its' strange effects on Royalty,
   But after an hour, this song has no power,
   And by now, it's boring ME!                             (16)

   Duchess Malinda, who doesn't do windas

              To sing the whole song, the song, the song
              Longer than a Royal Court, it is!
              But sing it serial, this ditty Imperial
              And you'll be a bardic whiz!                 (5)

                                             IMPERIUM COMPOUND    
                                             (Atenveldt Verses)

   Now here's a story, a little bit gory,
   A little bit happy, a little bit sad.
   About a drink called Imperium Compound
   And how the SCA's been had!                       

   Chorus: Oh we think, we think, we think,
           The King is a fink, a fink, a fink,
           A figure of respectability
           Rules the Kingdom thru Imperium Compound
           The results are plain to see!

   Mongol Hordemen, those free-living swordsmen
   Subverting the Kingdoms from underneath!
   Have no use for Imperium Compound
   Except perhaps to brush their teeth!

   AltChorus: Oh we fink, we fink, we fink,
              The Khan and the Kink, the Kink, the Kink,
              And the Board, their Great Senilities!
              The Western Irgun, drinks Imperium Compound
              And we're BACK, with results you'll see!    

   Lady Laurel, with Authority Royal,
   Passes and rejects our heraldry
   She needs a swig of Imperium Compound
   Then perhaps she'd deign to talk to me!            

   Lady Trude thought it her duty
   To turn a social wrong into a Right
   Proved her point with Imperium Compound
   And showed that Cheshire Cats can fight!  //and scratch//

   The Board of Directors styled themselves The Electors
   And another con they tried to swing
   Now the BoD drinks Imperium Compound
   So we no longer need a King!                        

   AltChorus: Oh the Bod, the BoD, the BoD,
              It thinks it is God, is God, is God,
              The figure of Supreme Authority!
              And if we O.D.'d on Imperium Compund
              there'd be no need for Royalty!          

   Oh, MEDIEVAL Net, we thought it was all wet
   With witty remarks, and other kinds of sass
   We'll feed our computers on Imperium Compound
   And BYTE the BoD right on its' righteous ass!         

   Good old Duncan was often drunken
   Chasing all the ladies fair
   He bathed himself in Imperium Compound
   Now he has a little savoir faire!                     

                    (more)


  ATEN IMPERIUM (cont.)

   Ioseph of Locksley, never changes his socks, he
   Runs around looking like a Cavalier,
   He stocked up on Imperium Compound
   And he has enough to last for years and years!        

   AltChorus: Oh they forgot, forgot, forgot
              The Locks-e-ly Plot, the Plot, the Plot!
              And it works the best when it is underground!
              It isn't a hassle for a green-and-white tassle
              They're the ones that BREW Imperium Compound!  

   Trelon of the Wood, he was very good, he
   Was a leader that had never been beat before;
   But Caid had Imperium Compound,
   And Imperial Roman Caid won the War!  //with help!//   

   In Tyr Ysgithr, it's regularly whispered there
   That the Kingdom is ruled over by a King    // What's THAT? //
   They're ""democratic"" and quite erratic....
   They've forgot the purpose of the whole damn thing!     

   King Sir Mark von, with his pretty white suit on,
   Rules the Kingdom both with Grace and Purity!
   He never touches Imperium Compound
   At least not where anyone else can see!               

   Duke Sir Deaton, was never beaten
   On the field, or in the drinking hall;
   At the Catbox War with Caid,
   Left thirty bodies piled against the wall!             

   Denis O'Titans was good at smitin'
   A Locksley Monster in every single way!
   Drank a little Imperium Compound
   And ATE Deaton's sword that day  // No! REALLY! //

   Duke Sir Brion, with his pretty white suit on,
   Is a model of goodness and purity
   Never touches Imperium Compound
(spoken:) And I'll sell ya seashore property in Yuma, too!  

   Optional last verse:

   Many tales abound of Imperium Compound
   And its' strange effects on Royalty,

   And by now, it's boring ME!

                recorded: CELTIC CIRCLE DANCE
                          WTP-0002C

        Last night I had the strangest dream in this bleak century
        I dreamed that people the world around believed in Chivalry

        I dreamed I saw a Kingly Crown enshrined in laurel leaves
        with Grace and Joy and Purity attendant at his feet

        I dreamed I saw the perfect Knight receive his accolade
        and minstrels sang and children laughed in some soft forest glade

        I dreamed I saw the finest thing that ever man could make
        grow great and strong and undefiled: Pray God I never wake!

        Last night I had the strangest dream in this bleak century
        I dreamed that people the world around believed in Chivalry

               (to the tune of ""Good King Wenceslaus"")

                Locksley Monsters never yield
                on the field of battle
                strike the helm and bash the shield
                make their eyeteeth rattle
                Bodies on the ground will lie
                bones will burst in sunder
                search for Locksleys' enemies:
                You'll find them six feet under!

                              SONG OF IVANOF

            There is a man who we know well that does the best he can
            but he's displayed in armour made of reticulated garbage cans!

            He looks so fine and fair and strong, oh how he plays the man
            and how it's prized, those galvanized, reticulated garbage cans

            The noblest Roman of them all, a good Praetorian
            a combatant who wears no pants, judst reticulated garbage cans!

            Like old Horatius at the Bridge, like the Legions of Valerian
            (O dearie me: those LOVELY knees!)
            and those reticulated garbage cans!

         (sung to the tune (obviously) of the 12 Days of Christmas)


1.           The first time I sent my device, The Heralds said to me

            ""It violates the Rule of Three""

2.           The next time I tried it, the Heralds said to me

            ""We changed the forms, and it violates the Rule of
             Three"".

3.           The third time I tried, and the Heralds said to me, 

            ""We upped the fees, we changed the forms, and it
             violates the Rule of Three"".

4.           Another time I tried and the Heralds said to me,
 
            ""We haven't got it, we upped the fees, we changed the 
             forms, and it violates the Rule of Three"".

5.           The fifth time I tried it, the Heralds said to me,  

            ""In a decision rendered by the College of Arms on
             August 1st, A.S. V it was decided that this style of
             heraldic design was not appropriate to the aims and 
             intentions of the Corporate Body. Holy! Holy! Holy! ""

 note: verse 5 is delivered in an extremely fast, mono-
       tone, similiar to a Gregorian Chant.

           "" ....we haven't got it, we upped the fees, we changed the forms,
             and it violates the Rule of Three.""

6.           I tried it a sixth time, and the Heralds said to me,

            ""We changed the rules, &c""

7.           A seventh time I tried and, the Heralds said to me,

            ""It's against the Rule of Tincture, we changed the
             rules, &c""

8.           I tried it once again and the heralds said to me,

            ""It's not a Period design, It's against the Rule of Tincture, We
             changed the rules, &c""

                                * more *



    Heralds Said To Me (cont.)

9.           I sent it in once more, and the Heralds said to me,

            ""We changed the rules again, It's not a Period design,
             it's against the Rule of Tincture, we changed the
             rules, &c""

10. (sung in cold anger)
             The LAST time I sent my device, the Heralds said to me

    (sung in a state of SMUG)
             ""Someone else has got it, &c""




              (nb: every single one of these reasons has been used by the
              CoA, at one point or another, to reject perfectly good
              heraldry, along with some even MORE stupid.  If the shoe 
              fits....................!!!!!!!!)

                        BUGS ON THE BARONESS
                        Tune: Waltzing Matilda
 
           or: Who was that Vermin I saw you with last, Knight?
   or: There may be Lice on all you Knice, but there ain't no Lice on me

           Once there was a Barony howling in the wilderness
           nestled in the Valley where the River doesn't flow
           and the folks were driven buggy by the insects in the Revel Hall
           Authenticity is wonderful, but this doesn't go!

                   Bugs on the Baroness, bugs on the Baroness!
                   That was the cry that you heard all the day
                   and the scratching can be heard from Ysgithr to Ered Sul
                   why did we come here? Let's go away!

           See them all a scratching, nestled in their armour tight
           the fleas have a melee team that's challenging the field!
           call Truly Nolen! Someone's gotta help us out!
           the crabs are nesting in our helms but we'll never yield!

                   (chorus)

           Dawn comes a-breaking, the bugs have won the Coronet...
           flea-infested Conan-clones in piles upon the lawn
           where is the Barony? The bugs have eaten everyone...
           termites got the stick-jocks, and all their sticks are gone!

                  For all the Lands where I have dwelt
                  Oh Atenveldt, Oh Atenveldt
                  till rivers burn and mountains melt
                  lest I forget my Atenveldt
                  From deserts stark to snow-capped peaks
                  from silent lakes and laughing creeks
                  sing: Oh let man find his heart's ease
                  on rocky plains
                  in desert breeze

                  For oft I thought of mighty men
                  who carved a Land with sword and pen
                  and lit a candle, burning bright,
                  that pierced the darkness; stirred the night!
                  tho some are gone their deeds remain
                  this sunny Crown without a stain
                  sing: Oh, their deeds were not in vain!
                  in sunlit days
                  and falling rain.....

                  So raise your banners, blazoned bright
                  Advance the Dream and Shine the Light!
                  in battle's crash and Revel's song
                  raise high the Flag and wave it long!
                  For all the Lands wherein I've dwelt
                  I love you best, my Atenveldt!
                  Sing: Oh the Joy that I have felt!
                  My Atenveldt
                  My Atenveldt

      What the use of wearing panties
      whalebone corsets of your Auntie's
      boxer shorts and other scanties
      best of all is nude
      there's such fun in going bra-less
      now that it's no longer lawless
      'specially if your figure's flawless
      best of all is nude
      nude is what you're born in
      shirts are never torn in
      underwear and lacy flimsies, garter belts and other whimsies
      yards of itchy cloth to put your form in
      ducks all do it, maidens rue it
      even ancient Picts in Britain blue it
      going naked's how to do it
      best of all is nude!

      If your garters aren't elastic
      tie them up in knots fantastic
      (panty hose is something drastic!)
      best of all is nude!
      If you're tired of wearing clotheses
      shed your garment 'mongst the roses
      never mind the old bluenoses
      best of all is nude!
      Nude is best for ducking!
      Worst for horses bucking!
      Moonlit nights will see such sights
          that are very best for fooling round
                              .....and elbows!
      Nudity is grand to see
       a well-known antidote to virginity
      take your clothes off and you'll see:
      best of all is nude!

                   once I talked to a great Grey Man
                   spun three times and said with a sigh
                   hadn't been for the Runes had his other eye!

                   Hi said the Lady, dressed in green
                   prettiest thing I've ever seen
                   she went down underneath the hill
                   and came back out of her own free will

                   Brian Boru, on Irish ground
                   walked three times the Island round
                   Norsemen came lookin for a fight
                   just another Irish Saturday night!

                   Hi said Lugh on the banquest night
                   a poet and a player and a good wheelwright
                   a harper and a warrior and none the least:
                   a Druid and he got in to the Feast!

                   Harold Haardrada's face was red!
                   Came to Britain and he wound up dead
                   Stamford Bridge is where he's found
                   got six feet of English ground

                   the Legion with it's Eagles bright
                   marched into the Pictish night
                   met them there upon the sand
                   gave em up to the Wicker Man!

                   eight-legged steed and hound of Hel

                   the Circle goes where no man knows

                   Present is Past and Past is Me!

                   Rhiannon's Birds are still in flight

                   sang the Day and sang the Night
                   sang the Land and sang the Sea
                   sang the Song, and then sang Me!

                                  spread their seeds thruout the Land

                                  saw the Lady where she stood
                                  by the fire burning bright
                                  came to know his heart's delight!

                    WEAPONS AT THE DOOR

 Being a Polemic concerning the alleged Custom of the West Kingdom concerning 
 checking your Weapons at the Door of the Revel Hall. As the Satire is the 
 Weapon of the Bard, this said Polemic is to be checked at the Door, along with 
 swords, knives, redheaded Ladies and other such Deadly Things.....

         As I roved out to Western Lands to take the Western Air
         I went into a Revel Hall and I saw a Twelfth Night there
         but I was halted at the gate by a Privy Consellor
                 (that's the man who tells the King of the West how to go to
                  the bath room!)
         who told me I would have to check my Weapons at the door

         As I, in my astonishment, stood hung on tenter-pegs
         a Knight came in whose Prouess hung down between his legs
         the Doorman grabbed a greatsword and he struck the Knight full sore
         and gave him a reciept; he left his weapon at the door!

         a Bard was next whose goodly Voice has entertained us all
         but he, too, was prevented from entering the Hall
         and told he could not carry deadly weapons on the floor
         he left his Voice and Harp among the weapons at the door

         a Master entered graciously, a man we all know well
         who holds a 3rd Dan Black Belt, tho this he'd never tell
         the Master struggled valiantly, the Master cursed and swore
         but he left his hands, and feet, as weapons at the door

         the company was jovial, altho a bit dismayed
         for lack of proper cutlery, down to the smallest blade
         for even teeth and fingernails, each can be used in War
         were cut, and pulled, and left behind, as weapons at the door!

         And has their King not loyal Knights that He must be afraid
         of brawling in his Hall and of Assassin's bloody blade?
         the Rights of Men to carry Arms at least WE'VE not foreswore
         and a POX on them that made the Rule of Weapons at the Door!

                           THE STREETS OF ANN ARBOR

               As I walked out thru the streets of Ann Arbor
               as I walked out thru Ann Arbor one day
               I spied a young Mongol all dressed in white linen
               all dressed in white linen and cold as the clay

               I then spied another, done in on the sidewalk
               along with just about six dozen more
               their wounds were all gaping, from mace and from braoadsword
               from claymore and cannon, all dripping with gore

               what caused this grave carnage, I cried to the Monglos
               oh pray what's the reason for this awful sight
               my answer came slowly from under the corpse-pile
               ""It seems that our bark is much worse than our bite.....""

               the answer continued from pale lips a-shaking
               we sang all our songs and believed them as true
               the Dark Horde could never be beaten in battle
               we thought this was what all good Mongols could do...

               we went down to Atenveldt all for to plunder
               ""too large to defend"" was our song every night
               but Atenveldt's different from East, West or Middle
               there, even the bushes have learned how to bite!

               the Clann stole our ponies, the Scraelings our foodstuffs
               we ran into axes in AtenViking hands
               our maidens ran off with one Richard of Arkham
               and we're all that's left to return to our lands

               MacChluarains and Monsters, Lockehaven and Foxmoor
               that Kingdom is BIG and its' fighters are MEAN!
               we fought and we lost, and fled back to Ann Arbor
               we all came back home with results that you've seen

               keep away from that Land with its' cactus and marshes
               it's no place for Mongols who are bent on War
               they count their blows well, but they strick them yet better
               he crawled into his Yurt, and fell, dead, on the floor.....

       tune: the song of the Cowardly Lion, Tin Woodsman and Scarecrow
             in the movie version of the Wizard of Oz

        (Enter the Scarecrow, who singeth:)

        My wife is always nagging; my Prowess it is lagging
        I can't do anything
        she has got a reason, but revenge is out of season
        Oh I wish I could be King!

        If I just had the Crown on, I'd always have a frown on
        and the Barons on a string
        Heads they would be rolling, the Board would be cajoling
        Oh if only I was King!

        I am very fed up with the way this group is set up
        Oh I'd change everything!
        they are so high and mighty with the way that they do fight-ey
        Oh, someday I'll be King!

        Tho my wife is melancholic, and very...vitriolic
        she's a wasp without a sting!
        I'd have to supervise her with a pack of tranquilizers
        If I only was a King......

        (the Tin Woodsman joineth him, and singeth:)

        I grew up kind of cocky, and rather big, and stocky
        and straight as any rod
        on the field I'm a battallion, with the Ladies I'm a stallion
        ...Oh they'd better make me God!

        The other boys are jealous they say I'm over-zealous
        they'd do better to applaud
        the things that I am giving to this Dream that we are living
        oh I wish they'd make me God!

        They say that I'm conceited, but I'm just badly treated
        by people and by BoD
        just think of what they're missing by My Majesty dismissing
        Oh they'd better make me God!

        (the Cowardly Lion creepeth forth, and singeth:)

        Oh I could be a fighter, a great and mighty smiter
        and be the perfect knight
        it's a great and nasty shame, and everyone's to blame
        oh I wish that I could fight!

        Song of the Three (cont.)

        I could be a Cavalier drinking wine and ale and beer
        and be a gorgeous sight
        but it would cost me too much money so it isn't very funny
        oh I wish that I could fight!                               

        Let me at 'em on the field, I would surely make them yield
        to my Power and my Might
        with rattan, shinai and rapier they would nevermore escape here
        If they'd only let me fight

                She was afraid to come out to the Tourney
                She was worried that ""something might show..""
                She was afraid to come out to the Tourney
                And the poor thing did NOT want to go...

                One day in the Kingdom of the Middle
                It happened at a Tourney one day:
                The Mongols invaded the Middle
                But the Middle did not want to play...

                  (eins - zwei - drei, but the Dark Horde wouldn't die!)

                      by William Poundstone
                              1983

     Two mentalities are at work here: 1960s rock fans and 1980s
fundamentalist Christians. The idea of phonographically concealed
messages dates from the Paul McCartney death scare of 1969. For
hard-core types, the secret-message rumors never really died. Avid
rock fans have auditioned ever album release since the late 1960s
for hidden nuances. Backward messages, barely audible messages,
and messages on one stereo track only have been alleged. At the
other end of the sociosensual spectrum, fundamentalist Christians
have gotten into the act. TV programs such as PRAISE THE LORD and
THE 700 CLUB have propagated rumors of a satanic plot in the
recording industry, no less, in which various albums conceal
""backward-masked"" demonic murmurings. If THAT sounds too spacey to
be taken seriously, consider that it was the fundamentalist groups
who were behind House Resolution 6363, a bill introduced in the
U.S. House of Representatives by Robert K. Dornan (R., Calif.) in
1982 to label all suspect records: ""WARNING: THIS RECORD CONTAINS
BACKWARD MASKING THAT MAKES A VERBAL STATEMENT WHICH IS AUDIBLE
WHEN THIS RECORD IS PLAYED BACKWARD AND WHICH MAY BE PERCEPTIBLE
AT A SUBLIMINAL LEVEL WHEN THIS RECORD IS PLAYED FORWARD."" In
February 1983, the Arkansas State Senate passed a similar record-
labeling bill by a vote of 86 to 0.
     Contributing to the quasi-occult status of these rumors is
the difficulty of checking them out on home audio equipment. You
pretty much have to take someone else's word for it, or dismiss
the rumors out of hand.
     From a technical standpoint, there are four simple ways to
conceal a verbal message on a recording. The most obvious is to
record the message at a very low volume. The message may then be
recovered by turning the volume up while playing the record or
tape. If the message is faint enough, though, noise levels of home
equipment may garble it. If the accompanying music or lyrics are
loud enough, or if the message itself is indistinct or
electronically modified, it may be hard to hear on any equipment.
     A second gimmick is to record a message on one stereo track
only. Records and tapes have two independent recordings, of
course, normally played simultaneously for stereo effect. On a
record, each stereo track occupies on one side of the V-shaped
groove for the needle. On a tape, the tracks are recorded in
parallel lanes of the magnetic material. The two tracks are called
""right"" and ""left"" after the stereo speakers they will play on.
Otherwise, the tracks are interchangeable -- the sound mixer can
put anything he or she wants on each track. A message on one track
can be masked by simultaneous loud music or lyrics on the opposite
track. With normal stereo balance (or mono equipment) the loud
track drowns out the message track. At home, single-track messages
can be recovered by adjusting the stereo balance so that only the
desired track plays. Sometimes this trick also makes indistinct
words clearer. Even if the words are not exclusively on one track,
they may happen to be more audible on one track.
     A message could be recorded at a speed different from the
rest of the record. Then the record would have to be played faster
or slower than usual to recover the message. Unless the message
was at one of the standard speeds (say, 45 rpm on a 33 1/3 rpm
record), it could not be played normally on home equipment.
     The fourth and most commonly alleged trick is to record a
verbal message backward. Reversed speech has several unexpected
features. One is that syllables are not a constant in the reversal
process. A one-syllable word can have two or three syllables when
played backward. Thus ""number nine"" in the Beatles' REVOLUTION 9
reverses to ""Turn me on, dead man"" (or something like it), a jump
from three to five syllables.
     There is no simple way to predict what a word or phrase will
sound like reversed. Obviously, you can't just reverse the
letters.
     Reversed messages are difficult to recover at home. Record
turntables are not built to go backwards. Some have a neutral
setting, in which the pickup and amplifier remain active and you
can turn the record backward by hand. But hardly anyone has a
stead enough hand to produce satisfactory results.
     With patience, it is possible to reverse a cassette
recording. Transfer the music from the original record or tape
onto a blank tape cassette. Place the cassette flat on a table.
Draw our the part of the tape with the suspected message and snip
it off at both ends. Hold the tape segment horizontally. Rotate it
180 degrees, keep it horizontal at all times. This turns the tape
end for end. Splice the reversed tape segment back onto the two
loose ends of the cassette with strong adhesive tape. Reel the
tape back inside the cassette. The sliced segment will play
backward on an ordinary cassette player.
     I rented a recording studio to test the secret-message
rumors. New copiies of the records in question were transcribed on
a quarter-inch master tape. Where rumor alleged that a single
stereo track contained a message, right and left stereo tracks
were transcribed separately. Records with alleged inaudible
messages were treated similarly. To test claims of reversed
messages, recordings on the master tape were edited out and
spliced in backward. Twenty cuts or portions of cuts from sixteen
albums were tested.


""Another One Bites the Dust""
Queen, THE GAME

Rumor: When played backward, the lyrics say, ""It's fun to smoke
marijuana.""
Findings: There is something that sounds like ""It's fun to smoke
marijuana"" in the reversed music. It is repeated over and over. It
might be rendered no less faithfully, however, as ""sfun to scout
mare wanna."" This ""message"" is the reversal of the song title,
which is repeated as a line in the song.
     Let's make a distinction between engineered and phonetic
reversals. When an artist records a verbal statement, reverses it
by turning the tape end for end, mixes the reversed statement onto
a master tape, and has records and tapes produced from the master,
that is an engineered reversal. When the phonetic properties of
song lyrics are such that they can be reversed to sound like
something else, that is a phonetic reversal.
     ""It's fun to smoke marijuna"" is clearly a phonetic reversal.
The lyrics are perfectly plain played forward (""Another one bites
the dust""), no so plain played backward (""sfun to scout mare
wanna""). With an engineered reversal, the opposite should hold
true: gibberish forward, clear as a bell backward. Some are
prepared to believe that phonetic reversals are just as
intentional as engineered reversals -- that the songwriter
painstakinginly planned the phonetic double-entendre. In the
absence of confirming evidence, that just doesn't wash. It's too
easy to find coincidences. If, for example, the letters of the
alphabet are recited in conventional fashion (Ay, Bee, Cee, etc.)
and reversed, at least five sound like English language words. D
reverses to ""eden,"" F becomes ""pray,"" S becomes ""say,"" V becomes
""even,"" and Z becomes ""easy."" ""It's fun to smoke marijuana"" is
likewise a coincidence.


""A Child is Coming""
Jefferson Starship, BLOWS AGAINST THE EMPIRE

Rumor: When played backward, ""son of Satan.""
Findings: Another phonetic coincidence. The repeated ""It's getting
better"" reverses to an iffy ""son of Satan,"" the ""of"" drawn out and
the ""Satan"" strongly accented on the first syllable.


""Eldorado""
Electric Light Orchestra, ELDORADO

Rumor: When played backward, ""He is the nasty one/ Christ, you're
infernal/ It is said we're dead men/ Everyone who has the mark
will live.""
Findings: Coincidence. The supposed message lurks around the line
""On a voyage of no return to see."" Reversed, this passage becomes
the expected syllable salad -- no one hearing it would describe it
as anything but reversed music. Only if you listen while reading
along with what you're supposed to hear will you get anything. The
rumored version of the message is somewhat fudged. The passage
sounds more like ""He's to nasty one/ Christ you are, Christ,
you're fernal/ There wiss uh, we're dead men..."" There is no ""in""
in what is taken to be ""infernal."" The line that is supposed to be
""Everyone who has the mark will live"" isn't even close, though the
syllable count is right.


""Shoo Be Doo""
The Cars, CANDY-O

Rumor: When played backward, the word ""Satan"" repeated
approximately eleven times.
Findings: Coincidence. The rumor refers to the reversal of the ""Shoo
be doo, shoo be doo, shoo be doo..."" near the end of the song. Given
the mysterious logic of reversed phonemes, these three-syllable units
can be hard as a repeated two-syllable word. The word sounds a little
like ""Satan.""


""Snowblind""
Styx, PARADISE THEATER

Rumor: According to a mimeographed list of suspect records distributed
by Congressman Dornan, the words ""Satan move through our voices"" when
played backwards.
Findings: Negative. Despite repeated listenings, it was not even
possible to identify the part of the reversed track that Dornan et al.
are talking about.


""Stairway to Heaven""
Led Zeppelin, untitled, a.k.a. STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN

Rumor: In reverse, ""I live for Satan... The Lord turns me off...
There's no escaping it... Here's to my sweet Satan... There's power in
Satan... He will give you 666.""
Findings: Coincidence. If you listen very carefully to the ""And it
makes me wonder"" lines in reverse, you'll hear something approaching
""There's no escaping it."" A better description is ""There's no escape
do."" Knock of the last syllable, and you have ""There's no escape,"" a
complete, intelligible sentence in reverse. It's there, all right, but
it's not an unlikely enough coincidence to -- well, make you wonder.
      The ""Satan"" in ""I live for Satan"" is good and clear. The ""I live
for"" part isn't. The other alleged lines are unremarkable. All are
phonetic reversals of the entirely lucid forward lyrics and obviously
just accidents.


""When Electricity Came to Arkansas""
Black Oak Arkansas, BLACK OAK ARKANSAS and RONCH AND ROLL

Rumor: In reverse, ""Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan. He is God. He
is God.""
Findings: The BLACK OAK ARKANSAS cut was reversed. Again, pairs of
reversed syllables are being freely interpreted as ""Satan."" ""He is
God"" was not identifiable.


""Rain""
The Beatles, HEY JUDE

Rumor: Unintelligible lyrics at the end are reversed.
Findings: A true engineered reversal and not really a secret. ""Rain""
seems to have been the first popular recording to incorporate an
obviously reversed lyric. The story is that John Lennon accidentally
spliced the last part of the song in backward and liked the effect.
When reversed, the strange-sounding vocals at the end become
intelligible as a reprise starting with the drawn-out word
""sunshine.""
      The reversal is less apparent to the casual listener than it
might be because the accompanying music is not reversed. The ending
fits in smoothly with the rest of the song, the vocals suggesting a
foreign language.


""Fire on High""
Electric Light Orchestra, FACE THE MUSIC

Rumor: When played backward, ""The music is reversible, but time --
turn back!""
Findings: ""Fire on High"" is instrumental. About twenty-six seconds
into the music, scrambled speech is heard. It is mostly louder than
the accompanying music and begins with a two-syllable unit repeated
several times. The seeming speech lasts for about fourteen seconds.
      Reversing the music confirms that there is a true, engineered
message. In reverse, a voice (Jeff Lynne's?) says, ""The music is
reversible, but time -- turn back! Turn back! Turn back! Turn back!""
All the words are clear and unambiguous. Anyone comparing this to the
alleged reversal on ELO's ""Eldorado"" will have no trouble telling
which is genuine.


""Goodbye Blue Sky""
Pink Floyd, THE WALL

Rumor: In reverse, ""You have discovered the secret message.""
Findings: The ""secret message"" is at the very end of the instrumental
passage following the ""Goodbye Blue Sky"" vocals. It comes just before
the words ""What shall we do"" at the start of the song that is
identified as ""Empty Spaces"" on the record label and as ""What shall we
do now?"" on the record sleeve. Played forward, the message is less
apparent than the FACE THE MUSIC reversal: A reasonably attentive
listener might play THE WALL through and not catch it. It suggests
speech not quite close enough to be overheard. In context this is not
unusual because the ""Goodbye Blue Sky"" instrumental passage includes
""airport noises"" and other sound effects. A loud climax in the music
further masks the unintelligible voice.
      When played backward, the voice (Roger Waters?) plainly intones,
""Congratulations, you have just discovered the secret message. Please
send your answer to old Pink, care of the funny farm..."" As the voice
fades out, there may be another word -- perhaps ""Chalfonte or
""Chelsea"" -- after ""funny farm.""


""Heavy Metal Poisoning""
Styx, KILROY WAS HERE

Rumor: A red sticker on the KILROY WAS HERE cover warns, ""By order of
the Majority for Musical Morality, this album contains secret backward
messages...""
Findings: This is a case of second-generation backward-masking. Styx'
PARADISE THEATER did not contain a backward message, though a lot of
people said it did. So Styx has included a sure enough backward
message on KILROY WAS HERE. It is at the very beginning of ""Heavy
Metal Poisoning."" The reversed speech last about three seconds. There
is no musical background. The words reverse to ""Annuit coeptis. Novus
ordo seclorum."" This is the Latin motto encircling the pyramid on the
back of a dollar bill. The usual translation: ""God has favored our
undertakings. A new order of the ages.""
      The cover sticker's ""Majority for Musical Morality"" is a
fictitious Falwellesque group in the KILROY WAS HERE video. Although
the sticker suggests a plurality of ""messages,"" only one was found.


Space between ""I'm So Tired"" and ""Blackbird""
The Beatles, untitled, a.k.a. THE WHITE ALBUM

Rumor: A reversed message. At the time of the Paul-is-dead stories,
the segue from ""I'm So Tired"" to ""Blackbird"" was offered as evidence.
It was held to contain John Lennon's voice, reveresed, saying ""Paul is
dead, miss him, miss him, miss him."" That interpretation seems
unlikely now, but there is a mysterious low muttering between the
songs.
Findings: The mumbling is actually just to the ""I'm So Tired"" side of
the shiny ""space"" between cuts on the record. Each of the stereo
tracks was recorded separately, twice, and a copy of each track was
reversed. This produced four versions of the two-second passage: right
forward, left forward, right reversed, and left reversed. All were
equally unintelligible. It was not even apparent whether the voice is
forward or reversed. Nor could John Lennon be identified as the
speaker. There are nine or ten syllables. The first six (when played
forward) are a two-syllable unit repeated three times. There is little
or no difference betwen the stereo tracks. Any claimed interpretation
of the sounds seems doubtful.


""Strawberry Fields Forever""
The Beatles, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR

Rumor: It was, of course, claimed that John Lennon says ""I buried
Paul"" at the end. (It's forward, at the very end after the music
fades to complete silence, returns, and starts to fade out again.)
But Lennon told ROLLING STONE that the words are ""cranberry
sauce.""
Findings: They are ""cranberry sauce."" The ""sauce""/""Paul"" part is
indistinct, but the first syllable sounds a lot more like ""cran""
than ""I.""


""Baby You're a Rich Man""
The Beatles, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR

Rumor: On one of the tracks the line ""Baby you're a rich man too""
is sung as ""Baby you're a rich fag Jew,"" a dig at Brian Epstein.
Or some think it's ""rich fat Jew"" and claim it as evidence of
Beatle anti-Semitism.
Findings: Negative. The two stereo tracks are nearly identical.
It's always possible to hear words as similar-sounding words, but
basically, the lyrics jibe with the published version.


""Revolution 9""
The Beatles, untitled, a.k.a. THE WHITE ALBUM

Rumor: Various reversed and/or one-track speech. The reversal of
""Number nine"" to ""Turn me on, dead man"" has pretty much been
discounted as coincidence (though it appears on Congressman
Dornan's list).
Findings: Distinction between lyrics and any hidden message blurs
on ""Revolution 9."" The eight-minute cut is a montage of sounds
collected by John Lennon and Yoko Ono. It includes discordant
music, radio broadcasts, sirens, applause, gunfights, sports
cheers, the crackling of a fire, screams, a baby gurgling, a choir
singing, and much that cannot be identified. For this
investigation, ""Revolution 9"" was transcribed four times, twice on
each stereo channel. One copy of each of the tracks was reversed.
The four resulting versions were compared with each other and
against the original two-channel version.
     ""Revolution 9"" contains a lot of talking. Played in stereo,
forward, the longest stretch of understandable speech is probably
an announcer saying, ""...every one of them knew that as time went
by they'd get a little bit older and a little bit slower...""
     One believable instance of reversed speech occurs: someone
saying ""Let me out! Let me out!"" (once held to represent McCartney
in his totaled Aston-Martin). Two iffy reversals occur on the
backward recording of the right stereo track:""She used to be
assistant"" and ""There were two men..."" Neither is clear enough or
long enough to be convincing. Some of the music, including the
recurring theme, sounds more natural in reverse.
     ""Turn me on, dead man"" is a typical phonetic reversal. The
forward ""number nine"" (repeated throughout the cut) is clear; the
reversal is slurred -- something like ""turn me on dedmun."" It has
been claimed that ""number nine"" must be pronounced with a British
accent or with some careful inflection in order to reverse to
""Turn me on, dead man."" This seems not to be so. As an experiment,
three American-accent renderings of ""number nine"" were reversed.
All sound about as much like ""Turn me on, dead man"" as the record
did. Like the other phonetic reversals, ""Turn me on, dead man""
must be considered a coincidence.
     Much of ""Revolution 9"" is on one stereo track only. Near the
end a voice says ""A fine natural imbalance...the Watusi...the
twist...Eldorado...Eldorado."" ""A fine natural imbalance"" is on the
right track only, though the words that follow are in stereo. One
of the longer bits of speech -- ""Who could tell what he was
saying? His voice was low and his [unintelligible] was high and
his eyes were low"" -- is clear on the left track, a bare whisper
on the right.
     There is a stereophonically concealed ""secret message"" on
""Revolution 9."" The words are on the right track. They begin about
four minutes, fifty-eight seconds into the cut and run for about
twenty-two seconds. They are not likely to be noticed in stereo
because of the much louder left track. The sound of applause
begins on the left track at about five minutes, one second into
the cut. Deafening noises -- the clapping, sirens, music --
continue on the left track until five minutes, forty seconds. It
may or may not have been Lennon's and Ono's intention to conceal
the spoken passage. Given the haphazard quality of ""Revolution 9,""
the concealment may have been accidental. To recover the passage,
the left track must be switched off. The right track can then be
heard to contain a sound like a stopwatch ticking, behind these
words:

     So the wife called, and we better go to see a
     surgeon....[A SCREAM MUFFLES A LINE THAT SOUNDS LIKE
     Well, what with the prices, the prices have snowballed,
     no wonder it's closed.] ...So any and all, we went to
     see the dentist instead, who gave him a pair of teeth,
     which wasn't any good at all. So instead of that he
     joined the bloody navy and went to sea.
                      by William Poundstone
                              1986

     There really are backward messages on rock albums. And the
controversy over ""backward masking"" and ""porn rock"" has inspired a
whole new spate of messages. There may have been more genuine
backward messages in the past few years than ever before.
     The backward message controversy is usually traced to the
1960s and John Lennon's avant-garde sound mixing on such tracks as
""Revolution 9"" on the Beatles' WHITE ALBUM. Lennon probably wasn't
trying to conceal a message so much as create an interesting
sound.
     The matter might have ended right there had it not been for
the Paul McCartney death rumor. College kids tried playing Beatles
records forward, backward, and at various speeds to find ""clues""
to McCartney's fate. In the process they found snippets of speech
from Lennon's experiments. Even after McCartney was found safe and
sound in Scotland, some listeners continued to look for hidden
messages.
     Somehow, fundamentalist Christian groups became convinced
(ca. 1982) that the alleged messages were commercials for devil
worship. Not a single indisputable satanic message has turned up,
but there were scattered attempts to ban or label certain albums.
In 1986 one fundamentalist group announced that the theme song for
the old MR. ED TV show contains the word ""Satan"" when played
backward.)
     Ironically, the publicity accorded nonexistent messages has
inspired several artists -- among them porn rock hearing witness
Frank Zappa -- to hide real background messages in their music.
It's easy to do.
     The performer speaks or sings the message normally, then
reverses the tape, which is mixed into the soundtrack. This is all
accomplished simply enough at any recording studio.
     What's not so simple is playing it back. More home record,
cassette, and compact disk players won't play backward. You can
turn a record backward with a pencil eraser, but it's not good for
the needle or the turntable. The only way to reproduce the message
with full fidelity is to use a professional-quality reel-to-reel
tape player and splice the tape in backward.
     We used the facilities of KLOS radio in Los Angeles to
reverse some recent records containing true backward messages.


""Secret Messages""
Electric Light Orchestra, SECRET MESSAGES

ELO's ELDORADO album was among those alleged to contain satanic
backward masked messages. A patient listening to ELDORADO played
backward reveals no such messages. You hear only what you ought to
hear -- the reversed lyrics of the songs, which sound nothing like
the ""messages"" claimed to be there. In the wake of such
allegations, ELO did put an (innocuous) backward message on their
FACE THE MUSIC album. Perhaps they thought this would show how
silly the allegations were. Instead, the backward-masking people
seized on this as proof that the other ""messages"" were real. In
the latest volley, ELO has named an album after the controversy.
     In Britain (where the backward-masking issue is viewed as an
American eccentricity), the cover of SECRET MESSAGES has a mock
warning label to youth about the hidden label. Word of the albums'
impending release in the United States caused enough of a furor to
chill CBS Records into deleting the cover blurb.
     The reversed message is easy to find. It's at the beginning
of the first song, which is itself called ""Secret Messages."" You
can hear reversed speech when you play the record normally. A
voice intones ""secret messages"" -- forward -- in the middle of the
reversed speech, lest anyone dare be so unhip as to not know
what's going on.
     We transferred a new copy of SECRET MESSAGES to reel-to-reel
tapes and played it backward. The backward message goes: ""WELCOME
TO THE BIG SHOW/ WELCOME TO THE BIG SHOW.""
     That's it.


""Ya Hozna""
Frank Zappa, THEM OR US

""Ya Hozna,"" a six-minute composition on the first record of the
THEM OR US double album, is ENTIRELY backward. The albums' inner
cover, which includes lyrics for the other songs, says, ""backwards
vocal -- you figure it out"" of this cut. It credits Frank and Moon
Zappa, George Duke, and Napoleon Murphy Brock as vocalists.
     Played forward, ""Ya Howza"" sounds like a record played
backward -- reasonably so. The vocals are prominent and
unintelligible. Moon Zappa's voice is curiously recognizable, even
in reverse. It is hard to tell whether the music was recorded
forward or backward.
     When ""Ya Howza"" is played in reverse, you discover that the
music is virtually a palindrome -- it sounds about the same
forward and backward. The voices are all backward. In some cases
they have been modified electronically. Many of the words are
muffled. Even after repeated careful listening on both stereo
tracks, it is difficult to make out many of the lyrics. It doesn't
help that some of the words seem to be stream-of-consciousness
nonsense. Some of the unintelligible stuff sounds like opera.
     Starting at the beginning of the reversed tape -- the end of
the forward tape -- the clearer vocals go like this: ""I am the
heaven, I am the water."" This is in a hymnlike register. ""You are
a lonely little girl./ But your mommy and your daddy hold you."" A
singsong synthesizer voice.
     The most interesting part of the lyrics is an intermittently
orgasmic rap in Moon Zappa's Valley Girl voice. There are three
short monologues:

I'm like green!
I'm like squat!
I'm like soul!
Repeat, like soul!
I'm like pull, push,
Okay, like slow, slow.

You're never too old
Like slow, like slow, like slow
Okay, I like it.


All right, faster, faster,
Go, do it, do it twice,
Yeah, that feels good,
I'm looking great,
Yeah, fer shure!
Like, no way!


""No Anchovies, Please""
J. Geils Band, LOVE STINKS

""No Anchovies, Please"" is a novelty song, really a narration with
sound effects, about a woman who is kidnapped after eating
anchovies. She is taken to a ""foreign-speaking"" country. The sound
effect of the foreign tongue seems reversed. When you do play it
in reverse, it becomes: ""It doesn't take a genius to know the
difference between chicken shit and chicken salad.""


""Darling Nikki""
Prince, PURPLE RAIN

""Darling Nikki,"" cited as porn rock before Congress, is about a
dominatrix in a hotel lobby masturbating with a magazine. In part,
the complaint was that the album cover (flowers, and Prince on a
motorcycle) wasn't explicit enough to warn kids of the suggestive
lyrics. Senator Paula Hawkins apparently was not aware of a
backward message hidden in ""Darling Nikki."" The last thirty-five
seconds of the song is gibberish. The music changes abruptly and
becomes a repeated glottal sound. Then a two-syllable sound is
repeated twice, something like ""heaven, heaven."" Unintelligible
speech follows. At the end is a sound reminiscent of rain or bacon
frying , and wind sounds.
     Played backward, the message becomes:

     Hello, how are you?
     I'm fine 'cause I know that the Lord is coming soon.
     Coming, coming soon.

     It is clearly Prince and the Revolution singing this. The
words are clear but the intonation is funny -- the linger on some
words. Perhaps this is to make the reversed message you hear
playing the record normally a little less conspicuous.
     This is a weird reversal of the supposed secret message
menace. Raunchy forward lyrics conceal a religious secret message.


""Judas Kiss""
Petra, MORE POWER TO YOU

Petra is an obscure group that sings religious songs to a rock
beat. As further proof that things have gone full circle, the
backward-masking controversy prompted Petra to include a wholesome
backward message on their MORE POWER TO YOU album. It is in the
transition between two songs, just before ""Judas Kiss."" Clearly
audible gibberish reverses to this (the husky voice a cross
between George Beverly Shea and Dee Snider): ""What are you looking
for the Devil for, when you ought to be looking for the Lord?""

AFL JoyceM Welcome to the Apple II Music & Sound chat - our discussion will
           be on NoiseTracker - the new FTA music program for the GS.  AFA
           Gene will be our host this evening...Gene, the floor is yours :)

AFA Gene   Hi all... well first I'd like to point out, if y'all aren't aware
           yet, that a spanking new version of NoiseTracker has recently
           been released (9 days ago) and is now available in our New Files
           library. It is version 0.5. I haven't played around with it much
           yet, but it's supposed to fix a lot of the little bugs in 0.3
           (the first version we had online).  NoiseTracker also includes
           the ability to directly import ""modules,"" a term used for a
           certain type of Amiga song file which has become popular among PC
           users using the SoundBlaster sound card.

           Now, via NT, these ""MOD"" files are accessible by the GS. We
           expect to see a lot of activity on this end as far as ports from
           the PC and Amiga go. Note that you should be able to go straight
           to the PC music forum and download any recently uploaded MOD
           songfiles (there was a bug in the first wide release of the PCAO
           software, however, so a bunch of files with dates between around
           March 1991 and September 1991 may not download properly. Note that
           to use these PC MOD files, you'll have to rename the downloaded
           file ""MOD.xxxxxx"" if you want it to show up automatically in NT's
           ""open"" dialog box. (On the PC, all MOD files are named
           ""xxxxxxxx.MOD"" instead.)   Also, if the files are packed with ZIP
           compression, you'll need a program from the Communications Forum
           called AGATE -- it's a terminal program that includes the ability
           to unpack ZIP files.

           Now, I guess the best thing to do would be to talk about our
           favorite songfiles... there have been a few complaints, in fact,
           that people were not being ""descriptive"" enough in their file
           descriptions for uploads in describing the songs.

AFC Eddie  ?

AFA Gene   GA ed

AFC Eddie  Once a MOD file is unpacked with Agate, is a file type change
           needed?

AFA Gene   Nope, since all that NT looks for is the ""MOD."" being the first
           four characters in the filename.

AFC Eddie  OK, Thanks!

Deanna7332 Question...

JonL7      Can you list some of the features of Noisetracker?

AFA Gene   (you don't even need that ""MOD."" if you want to type the name in
           directly.)

Deanna7332 Did any of these mod files have anything to do with FTA's ""Module
           A""

AFA Gene   Sure Jon, right after we answer Deanna's question. Deanna, you
           mean ""Modulae?""

Deanna7332 Yes, that's it.

AFA Gene   Modulae was a demo written by FTA last year. (i'll get to you in a
           sec Doors).  It used SoundSmith v0.95 for all it's music. There
           is no connection between MOD files and Modulae by FTA.

Deanna7332 Throughout the demo it said ""Loading modules""

AFA Gene   Those ""modules"" are not the same as Amiga soundfile ""modules"" --
           you see, what Modulae really was was a ""stringing together"" of a
           bunch of neat little tiny demos that FTA had written. So they
           called each little demo a ""module"" and thus the entire demo as a
           whole, ""Modulae"" (fancy plural of module?)

Deanna7332 Ok I understand.  Thank you. :)

AFL JoyceM Latin, Gene :)

AFA Gene   The term ""MODule"" from the Amiga comes from the idea that all the
           stuff needed to play the songfile (all the instruments + the
           sequence file) are included into one file, the ""module.""

TheDoors1  Gene, I have tried to d/l some recent uploaded MODs in the PC
           music area and still the problem exists.

AFA Gene   As I understand it, the problem was fixed VERY recently (correct
           me on this Joyce) and files uploaded as recently as early
           November still might not work depending on the version of the
           PCAO software that the uploader used.

AFL JoyceM Actually, Gene...I was under the impression that it had been, but
           if Doors is still having a problem, then it must not be fixed.

AFA Gene   What date was the file you tried to d/l, Door?

TheDoors1  umm 11/17, around there

AFA Gene   hmmm.... well i can tell you one thing... if it didn't work, don't
           waste your time again later... the problem is in the Apple
           software's method of d/lling files, and there are no plans to
           upgrade the Apple AO software.

AFL JoyceM I will endeavor to get an answer to that PC downloading
           problem/question :)

ThomasK63  i have a quick question... what can you use to unpack amiga mod
           files? On the PC side, that is.

TheDoors1  Agate Thomas

ELECTMUSIC Doors... what happens on after downloading..

Deanna7332 If it's LZHed you can't unless you have an IBM or
           PC/Transporter.

AFA Gene   If GS-ShrinkIt doesn't have that ability, i don't think there
           exists any such utility on the GS.

TheDoors1  What do you mean Elect?

ELECTMUSIC After you download the file... where do you encounter a problem?

TheDoors1  ok, you know when you download the file and at some point in the
           download the file starts to appear on your screen.  That's when I
           cancel it.

ThomasK63  I am sure soething good can be made w/out resorting to Amiga
           files

AFC Eddie  Yes, Doors, I believe the problem is with the PC software it was
           UL'd with.

TheDoors1  yeah Eddie.

GNO Tim    Amiga MOD files are typically compressed using LHarc.  I've
           uncompressed several on my Unix machine at school.

ThomasK63  good time for someone to make a lharc unpacker...

AFC DYAJim someone might be ;)

GNO Tim    Several people are already

AFC Eddie  Can't wait, Jim!

AFA Gene   Jon, did you have a question?

JonL7      The features of Noisetracker :)

AFA Gene   Oh yes... okay, here goes, in a nutshell, from most important to
           least:


AFA Gene   *  ability to import MOD files

           *  ability to import Soundsmith files

           *  ProDOS 8 based

           *  virtually no editing abilities (not a feature but important to
           know)

AFC DYAJim :)

AFA Gene   *  forgot: and the most important feature of all, the ability to
           hold instrument files in regular system RAM instead of DOC RAM,
           allowing for instruments far beyond the regular 64K limit found
           in ALL other GS music programs.

ThomasK63  I'll buy that!

TheDoors1  I have another question...when you're ready.

AFA Gene   GA Doors

TheDoors1  ok..is it true that NoiseTracker will take in soundsmith files and
           play them more clearly

AFA Gene   Well, as far as ""what you hear,"" yes there is a definite
           difference with some instruments. It does NOT play the sounds
           more ""clearly,"" but it just plays them in a different way. What
           many people seem to like about this ""different way"" is that
           sustained instruments (i.e. instruments designed to be played
           in a loop to simulate a long held note) seem to work better (or
           perhaps simply the way they were originally intended to work).

TheDoors1  I see

Deanna7332 Which takes up more space - MOD or NT  w/soundfile ?

AFA Gene   Deanna, it depends a few things, such as how big the sequence is,
           how many instruments you have, etc. Once you have a lot of
           assorted files, it'll probably average out to be about the same
           give or take a hundred blocks on your HD. So it basically depends
           on whether you prefer to have your instruments separate or not.

Deanna7332 Does playing quality differ with either one ?

AFA Gene   Nope. It's exactly the same either way. Loading time is the same
           too.

AFC Eddie  Can NT save songs as MOD files?

AFA Gene   Nope. It has options for Open and Close module, but these are
           still inactive.

AFA Gene   If there are no more questions, I'd like to talk about which NT
           files out there are the ""hottest,"" since this info could be
           useful to many users who are interested in downloading NT/MOD
           files.

           My personal favorite is ""Lambada,"" which is supplied by FTA with
           the program but is available separately on America
           Online.Everything about this file is really impressive except
           perhaps the sound quality of the horn-ish melody instrument.

           What about y'all, what are your favorite NT files?

AFL JoyceM Gene, there is a classical song for NT, but can't remember the
           name, but it is good.

AFC Eddie  I like Dragnet!

ELECTMUSIC So do I Ed

TheDoors1  I like Seven something

Deanna7332 My most favorite of all mod files is Pleasure Principle

AFC Eddie  <--appreciate's Greg's taste!

AFL JoyceM :)

AFA Gene   Deanna, i assume you got that from a local board?

Deanna7332 I got it from the PC forum here.

TheDoors1  I saw it there also

Deanna7332 I think under ""Pleasure""

AFA Gene   Would you be able to upload it here? If it's really that good, we
           ought to have it available directly in our oun NT lib here (BTW
           folks, we will be releasing a new NoiseTracker software library
           soon!)

AFC Eddie  What a Forum!!!

Deanna7332 That sounds great!

AFL JoyceM Gene, do you think it will be possible for synthLAB files to be
           converted to MOD files?

AFL JoyceM MOD files?

AFA Gene   I doubt it, Joyce. The formats are so diametrically opposed in
           their entire basis of their file formats that it wouldn't be
           worth the time for a programmer to develop such a convertor.

Deanna7332 Isn't it possible to move the mod file from the PC forum to our
           music library?

AFA Gene   But..... it might be worth the time for a MIDI File Format to MOD
           convertor, since these two formats are more widely accepted.

Nuzz       they have nothing better to do Gene

ELECTMUSIC Gene.. some interesting similarities with DTune and NTracker

AFA Gene   They lose the file, tho, Deanna. :)

AFL JoyceM In what way, Greg?

ELECTMUSIC Both Prodos 8

Deanna7332 Shhh they won't know a thing :)

ELECTMUSIC I also believe Bill uses a shuttling of sound data between Doc
           Ram and Ram.

AFC Eddie  Interesting, Greg.

ELECTMUSIC Thats how he gets some of the excellent instrument quality

AFC Eddie  But Diversitune has that one distinction:  MIDI input.

AFL JoyceM Deanna, we would greatly appreciate it if you would upload that
           'Pleasure' song to our library :)

ELECTMUSIC Agreed Ed.. one of the factors FTA doesn't like to incorporate
           into their programs.

Deanna7332 I'll u/l it tonight if possible.

AFL JoyceM Thanks :)

AFC Eddie  Thanks, Deanna!

AFL JoyceM I will send Bill B a copy of NoiseTracker + some MOD files...to
           see what comments we get from him (will send when I get back).

AFC DYAJim What ever happened to that diversitune upgrade that was talked
           about ?

ELECTMUSIC That would be interesting Joyce

AFC Eddie  Bill apparently still working on it, Jim.

ELECTMUSIC I am sure he would appreciate the Prodos 8

AFC DYAJim good..

AFL JoyceM Jim...RSN....he was hoping by Christmas (this year), but he is
           soooo busy with his job, who knows?

AFC DYAJim Oh yeah, I noticed the speed calcuation in NT .5 is inaccurate
           :)

AFC DYAJim I recall he has set a lot of Christmas projected dates :)

ELECTMUSIC He was one of the first ""Free Tools"" experts in breaking all the
           rules for economic sake.

AFC DYAJim like for the vaporware DT inst editor like 2 years ago.

Deanna7332 Are there any Christmas Mod or NT songs?

AFC Eddie  Oh yeah, Diversi-Editor!

AFL JoyceM I know, Jim - but that I know he has been working on.

AFC DYAJim he projected Christmas for it, and it never came :)

AFA Gene   Not yet in AMS, but hopefully the Holiday Contest will change all
           that. :)

AFC DYAJim I look foreward to any upgrades..

AFL JoyceM Not that I am aware of Deanna - you have some?  hint, hint

Deanna7332 Nope sorry.  I was hoping there were some that could be u/led
           here

AFC DYAJim I'll be breaking out the xmas tune book rsn.. I should be able to
           midi a few :) (which rules out nt)

AFL JoyceM Question...

AFC Eddie  It would be more appropriate to have a converter from Appleworks
           spreadsheet to MOD than from MIDI!

AFL JoyceM If I got ahold of an Amiga song (MOD) disk...how would I convert
           them for here?

AFA Gene   You mean an Amiga-formatted disk?

AFL JoyceM Yes

AFC DYAJim Ack.. methinks you need an amiga and a null modem cable or a
           modem.

AFA Gene   Methinks Jim is right

AFC DYAJim LOL!!  Design your music in the spreadsheet then import to NT :)
           IT might actually have better editing?!! :)

AFC Eddie  Right!

AFL JoyceM Me thinks he is right.  If I had them upload to me, would that
           work?

AFA Gene   Yep; should work like a charm.

AFC DYAJim Yah.. as long as they're coming from an amiga

AFL JoyceM Great....I will work on that when I get back  (making note now).

AFL JoyceM Gene, will you get some of those files (NT) sent to that area
           tonight?  If so, I will leave the needed message :)

AFA Gene   That's all I have planned for tonight's chat, Joyce. Yep, I'll
           move some files right now.

AFL JoyceM Thanks...

AFL JoyceM Then we should have our NoiseTracker Library by end of the week in
           AMS :)

ELECTMUSIC Gene... quick question:  Are you launching NTracker from a 3.5
           disk?

AFL JoyceM Okay, guys...I will see you all the week of December 11th (may the
           4th) as I am off on vacation.

AFA Gene   Yep greg

AFC JohnC  Where are you going?

ELECTMUSIC Do you encounter out of memory problems

AFL JoyceM Night all...and Gene, thanks for an excellent chat and great
           explanations of NoiseTracker.

Nuzz       Joyce, I have good news for FutureSound owners. SoundConvert will
           support it in the first release

AFC Eddie  Great, Mike!

AFA Gene   Greg, i always keep my RAMdisk at 0 when using noisetracker. Not
           only are

AFC JohnC  Mike...SoundConvert...released?

AFL JoyceM Great, Mike.  When can we get SoundConvert, Mike? and FutureSound
           :)

AFA Gene   there a couple of bugs with memory management, but if you're
           loading in a MOD file that's really big, NT will eat your RAMdisk.

AFC Eddie  Sounds good.

Nuzz       The manual is being ""layout"". Release date should be about 1st
           week of Dec

ELECTMUSIC Tnxs Gene

AFC JohnC  YES.......WTG Nuzz!!!!!!!!

Deanna7332 Yes, why is there on some MOD files a stop somewhere in the middle
           ?

Deanna7332 That's really frustrating!

AFL JoyceM Mike, leave me E-Mail on when and how I can send your the $$ to
           get it.

AFL JoyceM Again...night all

Nuzz       gee John, I had to do something to explain the delay :)

ELECTMUSIC Thanks Gene for a GREAT chat!

AFC Eddie  Yes, Gene!  Great!

    John Michael Osbourne, (known as ""Ozzy"" to his fans), has in his long 
career as vocalist for Black Sabbath had his work with the group misconstrued 
as advocating Satanism.  In a 1983 radio special featuring Ozzy, the 
interviewer expressed precisely this point; ""...Ozzy has always been shrouded 
in the darkest of Satanic imagery.  Yet if you really listen to his music, 
you'll find that what he is saying differs greatly from his image....""(1)  Even 
the group's image has often been described as ""occult and diabolic"".(2)

    The important point to remember here is to differentiate between appearance 
and reality.  Although the name ""Black Sabbath"" conjures up images of witches 
and sorcerers paying homage to Satan for the powers bestowed upon them, this 
does not make it safe to assume that the group that went by this name 
necessarily drew the inspiration from the occult.(3)  The closest they ever 
came to it was a gothic horror film featuring Boris Karloff as narrator; they 
adopted their name directly from the name of this film.(4)  Black Sabbath was 
involved in the black arts as much as Karloff practiced casting spells off-
screen.  Tony Iommi, the group's guitarist, summed it up best when he described 
the group as having basically ""...the same appeal as a horror movie.  It's all 
an act.""(5)










    Just as their film counterpart did, Ozzy and Sabbath found the occult 
mythos to be an effective vehicle for powerful social commentary; particularly 
when put in the context of heavy-metal rock and roll.  Ozzy himself noted that 
there are ""...people who pick up my [album] cover[s] and go...'This guy's got 
to be singing about Devil, doom, death and destruction.'  Which is not the 
case....""(6)

    The late Lester Bangs likened the group to Bob Dylan and William Burroughs, 
describing them all as ""...moralists...trying to deal with a serious present 
situation in an honest way....""(7)  Ozzy and Black Sabbath merely bring to 
light the many evils of our world in their work, to try and make us realize 
that we are all victim to their influence.  They hope to make us recognize 
these evils so that we may take up arms against them; a point Ozzy emphatically 
stresses:  ""...one thing everybody has got to understand about Black Sabbath's 
lyrics.  They're not downer lyrics, they're just telling everybody where it's 
at...""(8)  He also cites the group's most controversial tune, ""Black Sabbath"", 
as a response to the ignorant hippie culture still force when the tune was 
written in 1970:  ""The hippies said: 'The world is beautiful man.' (sic)  You 
only had to look around you to see how crappy it was.  It was ridiculous 
listening to that stuff, let alone playing it, so we just wrote about the world 
the way it really was and how it affected us - and we felt better in ourselves 
because we were really being honest....""(9)

    I   1   HAVE YOU EVER THOUGH ABOUT YOUR SOUL-
        2   CAN IT BE SAVED?
        3   OR PERHAPS YOU THINK THAT WHEN YOU ARE DEAD
        4   YOU JUST STAY IN YOUR GRAVE.
        5   IS GOD JUST A THOUGHT WITHIN YOUR HEAD OR IS
        6   HE A PART OF YOU?
        7   IS CHRIST JUST A NAME THAT YOU READ IN A BOOK
        8   WHEN YOU WERE AT SCHOOL?

    II  9   WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT DEATH DO YOU LOSE
        10  YOUR BREATH OR DO YOU KEEP YOUR COOL?
        11  WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE THE POPE ON THE END
        12  OF A ROPE - DO YOU THINK HE'S A FOOL?
        13  WELL I'VE SEEN THE TRUTH - YES I'VE SEEN 
        14  THE LIGHT AND I'VE CHANGED MY WAYS.
        15  AND I'LL BE PREPARED WHEN YOU'RE LONELY 
        16  AND SCARED AT THE END OF OUR DAYS.

    III 17  COULD IT BE YOU'RE AFRAID OF WHAT YOU'R
        18  FRIENDS MIGHT SAY 
        19  IF THEY NEW YOU BELIEVED IN GOD ABOVE
        20  THEY SHOULD REALISE BEFORE THE CRITICISE
        21  THAT GOD IS THE ONLY WAY TO LOVE.

    IV  23  IS YOUR MIND SO SMALL THAT YOU HAVE TO FALL
        24 IN WITH THE PACK WHEREVER THEY RUN
        25  WILL YOU STILL SNEER WHEN DEATH IS NEAR
        26  AND SAY THEY MAY AS WELL WORSHIP THE SUN.

    V   27  I THINK IT WAS TRUE IT WAS PEOPLE LIKE YOU
        28  THAT CRUCIFIED CHRIST
        29  I THINK IT IS SAD THE OPINION YOU HADE WAS THE
        30  ONLY ONE VOICED.
        31  WILL YOU BE SO SURE WHEN YOUR DAY IS NEAR
        32  SAY YOU DON'T BELIEVE?
        33  YOU HAD THE CHANCE BUT YOU TURNED IT DOWN
        34  NOW YOU CAN'T RETRIEVE.










    VI  35  PERHAPS YOU'LL THINK BEFORE YOU SAY THAT
        36  GOD IS DEAD AND GONE
        37  OPEN YOUR EYES, JUST REALIZE THAT HE IS THE
        38  ONE.
        39  THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN SAVE YOU KNOW FROM
        40  ALL THIS SIN AND HATE.
        41  OR WILL YOU STILL JEER AT ALL YOU HEAR?
        42  YES!-I THINK IT'S TOO LATE.

    In this piece, the group asserts a belief in an afterlife and spiritual 
redemption.  As grisly as the image of a hanged pontiff is, its shock value is 
a necessary part of the message:  They reject religious dogma, stating that a 
belief in God, in one's own heart, is the only guiding light to help one inn 
his life (lines 11/12, 39/40).  Furthermore, the reject religious hypocrisy 
(lines 5/6, 7/8) and peer pressure (verses III, IV) as excuses for not 
accepting God.  To clarify further:  following the crowd does not justify 
shrugging responsibility for one's own actions.

    After re-reading, it becomes obvious that this song is an ascerbic critique 
of atheism; (line 35/36) I refer here again to verses three and four.  In these 
two verses, the picture painted in one of Godless conformity and how it's 
viewed as being as foolish as Paganism.  These lyrics set an example for the 
listener by relating personal experience (lines 13-16).  However, for those who 
cannot accept this the group has no recourse but to condemn them, although 
rather ironically; they hope that their rhetorical loss of faith in the 
listener will open his eyes (line 42).










                           B L A C K   S A B B A T H 



            WHAT IS THIS, THAT STANDS BEFORE ME?
            FIGURE IN BLACK, WHICH POINTS AT ME
            TURN ROUND QUICK AND START TO RUN
            FIND OUT I'M THE CHOSEN ONE.  OH, NO!
            
            BIG BLACK SHAPE WITH EYES OF FIRE
            TELLING PEOPLE THEIR DESIRE
            SATAN'S SITTING THERE, HE'S SMILING
            WATCHES THOSE FLAMES GET HIGHER AND HIGHER
            OH, NO, NO, -- PLEASE GOD HELP ME!
            
                IS THIS THE END MY FRIEND?
                SATAN'S COMING 'ROUND THE BEND
                PEOPLE RUNNING 'CAUSE THEY'RE SCARED
                THE PEOPLE BETTER GO AND BEWARE
                NO, NO!  PLEASE--NO!!
                
                
    The all time controversy winner!  Is this not irrefutably  THE song about 
Black Magic in rock?  It's all so obvious, suffuse with evil imagery; Satan, 
walls of flame, figure in black, and damnation at the end.  Yes, I see the 
images too; it definitely concerns Black Magic.  Then again, Shakespeare's 
Macbeth employed scenes of witches involved in conjurations; does that mean 
that Shakespeare was a warlock?  Poe used to write sardonic tragedies about 
twisted murderers and the bizarre nature of acts, did that make him an evil, 
leering, demented killer?  Did either of them advocated what they wrote about?  
One has to remember that writing about something is not necessarily the same as 
emulating it.  Tony Iommi spoke out quite strongly about this:  ""People are 
bringing us down saying that we are a Black Magic group.  I think they must be










getting mixed up with Black Widow.  We don't do any sacrifices on stage, and 
we're not on a black magic kick.  We wanted to do heavy numbers and the guitar 
riffs we worked out were more suited to evil things than love.  We play songs 
about black magic, but they are more likely to be against than for it.""(12)  

    By now, you're probably asking yourself who Black Widow is, right?  Then 
it's time for a little history:

        Sabbath, before they were known as Sabbath, had the same line-up but 
two earlier names.  The first one was Polka Tulk, which seemed sure to doom 
them to obscurity.(13)  The soon realized this and changed the group's name to 
Earth.  Now, Earth was a blues band at the end of the English blues boom.  As 
if that wasn't bad enough, they soon discovered that not only was there another 
group named Earth, but they had also released a single.  To avoid confusion, 
they changed their name again.(14)  But what made them decide on that name?  
Just ask Ozzy:  ""I just liked the name Black Sabbath because of the succession 
of vowel sounds.(15)  If that sounds ludicrous just consider this:  Sabbath was 
""...the first of the really committed, loud and heavy bands...""(16)  They 
needed a name to match the gut-wrenching power they were developing.  Tony knew 
that he wanted Sabbath to be noticed above all the rest of the British blues 
bands:  ""We wanted something of our own that we'd like and people would like.  
And we wanted something loud!""










    Tony didn't hate the blues.  He'd cut his teeth as a guitarist on the likes 
of The Shadows, Buddy Holly and Django Rheinhardt, developing his own style 
from there.  But he realized the group had no future in the blues:

        'We couldn't keep playing 12-bars forever.  We just got fed up with 
Earth music.  It was jazz, blues stuff.  It was good for practice but nothing 
else.'

    In the late 'Sixties, blues groups were a dime a dozen in Birmingham and 
interest was waning in the blues boom due to the glut of groups.  One man, by 
the name of Jim Simpson, had heard Earth around the Birmingham club circuit and 
understood what they were trying to do.  He decided to take them under his 
wing.  With the aid of his massive record collection, Jim expanded the group's 
horizons in the areas of jazz and blues.  He introduced them to artists like 
Wes Montgomery, Count Basie and Jimmy Rushing.  It was from Rushing in 
particular that they derived the repetitive riff style so readily noticeable in 
their later incarnation as Black Sabbath.

    The Count Basie influence is evidenced in the song ""Wicked World"" from the 
first album; Sabbath drummer Bill Ward uses a ""'sighing hi-hat'...in the manner 
of Basie's drummer Jo Jones.""










    The influence is subtle, almost subliminal.  Yet it is one which was not 
thought capable of hard, 'heavy' rock bands in the late 'Sixties.  Although Led 
Zeppelin and Jimi Hendrix also had their work steeped in blues and jazz 
derivations (Hendrix' ""Third Stone From the Sun"" and Zeppelin's version of 
Willie Dixon's ""I Can't Quit You Baby"" from their first album), neither was 
able to match the intense energy of Black Sabbath.  Iommi has always had a 
preference for music with an original, distinct style of its' own; as an 
example, he mentions guitarists Joe Pass and Alvin Lee as two of his strongest 
songwriting influences.

    It would also be necessary that Sabbath develop a unique, distinctive style 
and image of their own.  Though they had changed their name from Earth to Black 
Sabbath to avoid confusion with the other Earth; at the same time another group 
emerged by the name of Black Widow ""...who WERE profoundly influenced by the 
occult, had a male witch as a patron, and wrote pieces like ""Come to The 
Sabbat.""  Unfortunately, Sabbath was constantly reaping the benefits of Widow's 
publicity.

    Sabbath was a group that never minced words.  If they saw something as 
destructive, they would be sure to rub the listener's face it it.  They did not 
want their point to be missed.

    With their straightforward, sometimes brutal way of looking at things, they 
try to shock the listener's conscience back into awareness.  The imagery of 
""Hand of Doom"", from the Paranoid album, is candid and condemning; it is a 
strong statement against drug addiction and rightly so...

            IT'S TO LATE TOO TURN
            YOU DON'T WANNA LEARN
            PRICE OF LIFE YOU CRY
            NOW YOU'RE GONNA DIE
            
            
    Many people felt the group's overall direction was pessimistic and had a 
negative effect on its listener's due to that.  ""Ozzy insisted that if people 
thought he was having a bad effect on the minds of young kids, they should go 
and watch the TV news where real murder and mayhem were a way of life, and 
shown night after night."" (18)

    Sabbath was never negative in their message; they were simply truthful 
about waht they saw as wrong in the world.  If you ""Strip away the horror 
stories, the imagery and the hysteria, (and) turn down the amps a notch...you 
have a well-rehearsed, solid blues and rock band, powered by a dedication to 
well defined objectives.""  On the top of the list of those objectives was 
truth; Sabbath never feared facing that truth squarely, regardless of what many 
people thought of them.

Long, long, time ago,
I can still remember,
When the local calls were ""free"".
And I knew if I paid my bill,
And never wished them any ill,
That the phone company would let me be...

But Uncle Sam said he knew better,
Split 'em up, for all and ever!
We'll foster competition:
It's good capital-ism!

I can't remember if I cried,
When my phone bill first tripled in size.
But something touched me deep inside,
The day... Bell System... died.

And we were singing...

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

Is your office Step by Step,
Or have you gotten some Crossbar yet?
Everybody used to ask...
Oh, is TSPS coming soon?
IDDD will be a boon!
And, I hope to get a Touch-Tone phone, real soon...

The color phones are really neat,
And direct dialing can't be beat!
My area code is ""low"":
The prestige way to go!

Oh, they just raised phone booths to a dime!
Well, I suppose it's about time.
I remember how the payphones chimed,
The day... Bell System... died.

And we were singing...

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

Back then we were all at one rate,
Phone installs didn't cause debate,
About who'd put which wire where...
Installers came right out to you,
No ""phone stores"" with their ballyhoo,
And 411 was free, seemed very fair!

But FCC wanted it seems,
To let others skim long-distance creams,
No matter 'bout the locals,
They're mostly all just yokels!

And so one day it came to pass,
That the great Bell System did collapse,
In rubble now, we all do mass,
The day... Bell System... died.

So bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

I drove on out to Murray Hill,
To see Bell Labs, some time to kill,
But the sign there said the Labs were gone.
I went back to my old CO,
Where I'd had my phone lines, years ago,
But it was empty, dark, and ever so forlorn...

No relays pulsed,
No data crooned,
No MF tones did play their tunes,
There wasn't a word spoken,
All carrier paths were broken...

And so that's how it all occurred,
Microwave horns just nests for birds,
Everything became so absurd,
The day... Bell System... died.

So bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

We were singing:

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
                             *                          

                   THE REAL OLD TIME RELIGION
                   tune: ""Old Time Religion""

       (Chorus): Give me that real old time religion (3X)
                 It's good enough for me!

We will have a mighty orgy        We will sacrifice to Yuggoth
in the honour of Astarte          we will sacrifice to Yuggoth
it'll be a mighty party           Burn a candle for Yog-Soggoth
and it's good enough for me!      and the Goat With a Thousand Young!

We will all be saved by Mithras       If your rising sign is Aries
We will all be saved by Mithras       You'll be taken by the Fairies
slay the Bull and play the zithras    Meet the Buddah in Benares
on that Resurrection Day!             where he'll hit you with a pie!

I hear Valkyries a-comin                There are people into Voodoo
In the air their song is comin          there are people into Voodoo

                                             IMPERIUM COMPOUND    
                                             (Atenveldt Verses)

   Now here's a story, a little bit gory,
   A little bit happy, a little bit sad.
   About a drink called Imperium Compound
   And how the SCA's been had!                       

   Chorus: Oh we think, we think, we think,
           The King is a fink, a fink, a fink,
           A figure of respectability
           Rules the Kingdom thru Imperium Compound
           The results are plain to see!

   Mongol Hordemen, those free-living swordsmen
   Subverting the Kingdoms from underneath!
   Have no use for Imperium Compound
   Except perhaps to brush their teeth!

   AltChorus: Oh we fink, we fink, we fink,
              The Khan and the Kink, the Kink, the Kink,
              And the Board, their Great Senilities!
              The Western Irgun, drinks Imperium Compound
              And we're BACK, with results you'll see!    

   Lady Laurel, with Authority Royal,
   Passes and rejects our heraldry
   She needs a swig of Imperium Compound
   Then perhaps she'd deign to talk to me!            

   Lady Trude thought it her duty
   To turn a social wrong into a Right
   Proved her point with Imperium Compound
   And showed that Cheshire Cats can fight!  //and scratch//

   The Board of Directors styled themselves The Electors
   And another con they tried to swing
   Now the BoD drinks Imperium Compound
   So we no longer need a King!                        

   AltChorus: Oh the Bod, the BoD, the BoD,
              It thinks it is God, is God, is God,
              The figure of Supreme Authority!
              And if we O.D.'d on Imperium Compund
              there'd be no need for Royalty!          

   Oh, MEDIEVAL Net, we thought it was all wet
   With witty remarks, and other kinds of sass
   We'll feed our computers on Imperium Compound
   And BYTE the BoD right on its' righteous ass!         

   Good old Duncan was often drunken
   Chasing all the ladies fair
   He bathed himself in Imperium Compound
   Now he has a little savoir faire!                     

                    (more)


  ATEN IMPERIUM (cont.)

   Ioseph of Locksley, never changes his socks, he
   Runs around looking like a Cavalier,
   He stocked up on Imperium Compound
   And he has enough to last for years and years!        

   AltChorus: Oh they forgot, forgot, forgot
              The Locks-e-ly Plot, the Plot, the Plot!
              And it works the best when it is underground!
              It isn't a hassle for a green-and-white tassle
              They're the ones that BREW Imperium Compound!  

   Trelon of the Wood, he was very good, he
   Was a leader that had never been beat before;
   But Caid had Imperium Compound,
   And Imperial Roman Caid won the War!  //with help!//   

   In Tyr Ysgithr, it's regularly whispered there
   That the Kingdom is ruled over by a King    // What's THAT? //
   They're ""democratic"" and quite erratic....
   They've forgot the purpose of the whole damn thing!     

   King Sir Mark von, with his pretty white suit on,
   Rules the Kingdom both with Grace and Purity!
   He never touches Imperium Compound
   At least not where anyone else can see!               

   Duke Sir Deaton, was never beaten
   On the field, or in the drinking hall;
   At the Catbox War with Caid,
   Left thirty bodies piled against the wall!             

   Denis O'Titans was good at smitin'
   A Locksley Monster in every single way!
   Drank a little Imperium Compound
   And ATE Deaton's sword that day  // No! REALLY! //

                          WTP-0002C

        Last night I had the strangest dream in this bleak century
        I dreamed that people the world around believed in Chivalry

        I dreamed I saw a Kingly Crown enshrined in laurel leaves
        with Grace and Joy and Purity attendant at his feet

        I dreamed I saw the perfect Knight receive his accolade
        and minstrels sang and children laughed in some soft forest glade

        I dreamed I saw the finest thing that ever man could make
        grow great and strong and undefiled: Pray God I never wake!

        Last night I had the strangest dream in this bleak century
        I dreamed that people the world around believed in Chivalry

               (to the tune of ""Good King Wenceslaus"")

                Locksley Monsters never yield
                on the field of battle
                strike the helm and bash the shield
                make their eyeteeth rattle
                Bodies on the ground will lie
                bones will burst in sunder
                search for Locksleys' enemies:

            There is a man who we know well that does the best he can
            but he's displayed in armour made of reticulated garbage cans!

            He looks so fine and fair and strong, oh how he plays the man
            and how it's prized, those galvanized, reticulated garbage cans

            The noblest Roman of them all, a good Praetorian
            a combatant who wears no pants, judst reticulated garbage cans!

            Like old Horatius at the Bridge, like the Legions of Valerian
            (O dearie me: those LOVELY knees!)
            and those reticulated garbage cans!

         (sung to the tune (obviously) of the 12 Days of Christmas)


1.           The first time I sent my device, The Heralds said to me

            ""It violates the Rule of Three""

2.           The next time I tried it, the Heralds said to me

            ""We changed the forms, and it violates the Rule of
             Three"".

3.           The third time I tried, and the Heralds said to me, 

            ""We upped the fees, we changed the forms, and it
             violates the Rule of Three"".

4.           Another time I tried and the Heralds said to me,
 
            ""We haven't got it, we upped the fees, we changed the 
             forms, and it violates the Rule of Three"".

5.           The fifth time I tried it, the Heralds said to me,  

            ""In a decision rendered by the College of Arms on
             August 1st, A.S. V it was decided that this style of
             heraldic design was not appropriate to the aims and 
             intentions of the Corporate Body. Holy! Holy! Holy! ""

 note: verse 5 is delivered in an extremely fast, mono-
       tone, similiar to a Gregorian Chant.

           "" ....we haven't got it, we upped the fees, we changed the forms,
             and it violates the Rule of Three.""

6.           I tried it a sixth time, and the Heralds said to me,

            ""We changed the rules, &c""

7.           A seventh time I tried and, the Heralds said to me,

            ""It's against the Rule of Tincture, we changed the
             rules, &c""

8.           I tried it once again and the heralds said to me,

            ""It's not a Period design, It's against the Rule of Tincture, We
             changed the rules, &c""

                                * more *



    Heralds Said To Me (cont.)

9.           I sent it in once more, and the Heralds said to me,

            ""We changed the rules again, It's not a Period design,
             it's against the Rule of Tincture, we changed the
             rules, &c""

10. (sung in cold anger)
             The LAST time I sent my device, the Heralds said to me

    (sung in a state of SMUG)
             ""Someone else has got it, &c""




              (nb: every single one of these reasons has been used by the
              CoA, at one point or another, to reject perfectly good
              heraldry, along with some even MORE stupid.  If the shoe 
              fits....................!!!!!!!!)

           or: Who was that Vermin I saw you with last, Knight?
   or: There may be Lice on all you Knice, but there ain't no Lice on me

           Once there was a Barony howling in the wilderness
           nestled in the Valley where the River doesn't flow
           and the folks were driven buggy by the insects in the Revel Hall
           Authenticity is wonderful, but this doesn't go!

                   Bugs on the Baroness, bugs on the Baroness!
                   That was the cry that you heard all the day
                   and the scratching can be heard from Ysgithr to Ered Sul
                   why did we come here? Let's go away!

           See them all a scratching, nestled in their armour tight
           the fleas have a melee team that's challenging the field!
           call Truly Nolen! Someone's gotta help us out!
           the crabs are nesting in our helms but we'll never yield!

                   (chorus)

           Dawn comes a-breaking, the bugs have won the Coronet...
           flea-infested Conan-clones in piles upon the lawn
           where is the Barony? The bugs have eaten everyone...
           termites got the stick-jocks, and all their sticks are gone!

                   (chorus)

                  For oft I thought of mighty men
                  who carved a Land with sword and pen
                  and lit a candle, burning bright,
                  that pierced the darkness; stirred the night!

                  So raise your banners, blazoned bright
                  Advance the Dream and Shine the Light!
                  in battle's crash and Revel's song

      What the use of wearing panties
      whalebone corsets of your Auntie's
      boxer shorts and other scanties
      best of all is nude
      there's such fun in going bra-less
      now that it's no longer lawless
      'specially if your figure's flawless
      best of all is nude
      nude is what you're born in
      shirts are never torn in
      underwear and lacy flimsies, garter belts and other whimsies
      yards of itchy cloth to put your form in
      ducks all do it, maidens rue it
      even ancient Picts in Britain blue it
      going naked's how to do it
      best of all is nude!

      If your garters aren't elastic
      tie them up in knots fantastic
      (panty hose is something drastic!)
      best of all is nude!
      If you're tired of wearing clotheses
      shed your garment 'mongst the roses
      never mind the old bluenoses
      best of all is nude!
      Nude is best for ducking!
      Worst for horses bucking!
      Moonlit nights will see such sights
          that are very best for fooling round
                              .....and elbows!
      Nudity is grand to see
       a well-known antidote to virginity
      take your clothes off and you'll see:
      best of all is nude!

                   once I talked to a great Grey Man
                   spun three times and said with a sigh
                   hadn't been for the Runes had his other eye!

                   prettiest thing I've ever seen
                   she went down underneath the hill
                   and came back out of her own free will

                   Brian Boru, on Irish ground
                   walked three times the Island round
                   Norsemen came lookin for a fight
                   just another Irish Saturday night!

                   Hi said Lugh on the banquest night
                   a poet and a player and a good wheelwright
                   a harper and a warrior and none the least:
                   a Druid and he got in to the Feast!

                   Harold Haardrada's face was red!

                   got six feet of English ground

                   the Legion with it's Eagles bright
                   marched into the Pictish night
                   met them there upon the sand
                   gave em up to the Wicker Man!

                   eight-legged steed and hound of Hel
                   the one-eyed Man, he loves ya well

                   are you then feared of the dark?

                   The Circle forms, the Circle flows
                   the Circle goes where no man knows
                   Hail to the Lady, one in three:
                   Present is Past and Past is Me!

                   Rhiannon's Birds are still in flight

                                  spread their seeds thruout the Land

                                  saw the Lady where she stood
                                  by the fire burning bright
                                  came to know his heart's delight!

                    WEAPONS AT THE DOOR

 Being a Polemic concerning the alleged Custom of the West Kingdom concerning 
 checking your Weapons at the Door of the Revel Hall. As the Satire is the 
 Weapon of the Bard, this said Polemic is to be checked at the Door, along with 
 swords, knives, redheaded Ladies and other such Deadly Things.....

         As I roved out to Western Lands to take the Western Air
         I went into a Revel Hall and I saw a Twelfth Night there
         but I was halted at the gate by a Privy Consellor
                 (that's the man who tells the King of the West how to go to
                  the bath room!)
         who told me I would have to check my Weapons at the door

         As I, in my astonishment, stood hung on tenter-pegs
         a Knight came in whose Prouess hung down between his legs
         the Doorman grabbed a greatsword and he struck the Knight full sore
         and gave him a reciept; he left his weapon at the door!

         a Bard was next whose goodly Voice has entertained us all
         but he, too, was prevented from entering the Hall
         and told he could not carry deadly weapons on the floor
         he left his Voice and Harp among the weapons at the door

         a Master entered graciously, a man we all know well
         who holds a 3rd Dan Black Belt, tho this he'd never tell
         the Master struggled valiantly, the Master cursed and swore
         but he left his hands, and feet, as weapons at the door

         the company was jovial, altho a bit dismayed
         for lack of proper cutlery, down to the smallest blade
         for even teeth and fingernails, each can be used in War
         were cut, and pulled, and left behind, as weapons at the door!

         And has their King not loyal Knights that He must be afraid
         of brawling in his Hall and of Assassin's bloody blade?
         the Rights of Men to carry Arms at least WE'VE not foreswore
         and a POX on them that made the Rule of Weapons at the Door!

                           THE STREETS OF ANN ARBOR

               As I walked out thru the streets of Ann Arbor
               as I walked out thru Ann Arbor one day
               I spied a young Mongol all dressed in white linen
               all dressed in white linen and cold as the clay

               I then spied another, done in on the sidewalk
               along with just about six dozen more
               their wounds were all gaping, from mace and from braoadsword
               from claymore and cannon, all dripping with gore

               what caused this grave carnage, I cried to the Monglos
               oh pray what's the reason for this awful sight
               my answer came slowly from under the corpse-pile
               ""It seems that our bark is much worse than our bite.....""

               the answer continued from pale lips a-shaking
               we sang all our songs and believed them as true
               the Dark Horde could never be beaten in battle
               we thought this was what all good Mongols could do...

               we went down to Atenveldt all for to plunder
               ""too large to defend"" was our song every night
               but Atenveldt's different from East, West or Middle
               there, even the bushes have learned how to bite!

               the Clann stole our ponies, the Scraelings our foodstuffs
               we ran into axes in AtenViking hands
               our maidens ran off with one Richard of Arkham
               and we're all that's left to return to our lands

               MacChluarains and Monsters, Lockehaven and Foxmoor
               that Kingdom is BIG and its' fighters are MEAN!
               we fought and we lost, and fled back to Ann Arbor
               we all came back home with results that you've seen

               keep away from that Land with its' cactus and marshes
               it's no place for Mongols who are bent on War
               they count their blows well, but they strick them yet better
               he crawled into his Yurt, and fell, dead, on the floor.....

                       SONG OF THE THREE
             copyright 1981 W. J. Bethancourt III
                            C. A. Bethancourt III
       tune: the song of the Cowardly Lion, Tin Woodsman and Scarecrow
             in the movie version of the Wizard of Oz

        (Enter the Scarecrow, who singeth:)

        My wife is always nagging; my Prowess it is lagging
        I can't do anything
        she has got a reason, but revenge is out of season
        Oh I wish I could be King!

        If I just had the Crown on, I'd always have a frown on
        and the Barons on a string
        Heads they would be rolling, the Board would be cajoling
        Oh if only I was King!

        I am very fed up with the way this group is set up
        Oh I'd change everything!
        they are so high and mighty with the way that they do fight-ey
        Oh, someday I'll be King!

        Tho my wife is melancholic, and very...vitriolic
        she's a wasp without a sting!
        I'd have to supervise her with a pack of tranquilizers
        If I only was a King......

        (the Tin Woodsman joineth him, and singeth:)

        I grew up kind of cocky, and rather big, and stocky
        and straight as any rod
        on the field I'm a battallion, with the Ladies I'm a stallion
        ...Oh they'd better make me God!

        The other boys are jealous they say I'm over-zealous
        they'd do better to applaud
        the things that I am giving to this Dream that we are living
        oh I wish they'd make me God!

        They say that I'm conceited, but I'm just badly treated
        by people and by BoD
        just think of what they're missing by My Majesty dismissing
        Oh they'd better make me God!

        (the Cowardly Lion creepeth forth, and singeth:)

        Oh I could be a fighter, a great and mighty smiter
        and be the perfect knight
        it's a great and nasty shame, and everyone's to blame
        oh I wish that I could fight!

        Song of the Three (cont.)

        I could be a Cavalier drinking wine and ale and beer
        and be a gorgeous sight
        but it would cost me too much money so it isn't very funny
        oh I wish that I could fight!                               

        Let me at 'em on the field, I would surely make them yield
        to my Power and my Might
        with rattan, shinai and rapier they would nevermore escape here
        If they'd only let me fight

        (all doeth the Softe Shoe off, stage left)

                She was afraid to come out to the Tourney
                She was worried that ""something might show..""
                She was afraid to come out to the Tourney
                And the poor thing did NOT want to go...

                  (2 - 3 - 4, tell the people what she wore!)

                  It was an itsy bitsy teeny weenie little rabbit fur bikini

                  An itsy bitsy teenie weenie little rabbit fur bikini
                  And in her apartment she wanted to stay!

                One day in the Kingdom of the Middle
                It happened at a Tourney one day:
                The Mongols invaded the Middle
                But the Middle did not want to play...

                  (eins - zwei - drei, but the Dark Horde wouldn't die!)

                  It was an itsy bitsy tiny teenie Nauseating Mongol weenie

          Some folks call me many names, others call me crazy
          Tom O'Bedlam's son am I, for my mind is hazy!
          I'd rather sing a song than work (if it's not too phrasey!)
          Lengthy rhymes don't bother me....truth to tell: I'm lazy!

          Yang, your yurt is very nice, and your Horde is smelly,
          And I'm sure that yak-meat will nicely fill one's belly!
          But remember this one line, or you're not worth jelly:
          FIRST you plunder, THEN you burn! That's how to be rakehelly!

          My Lady Lorelei your eyes do drive me to distraction
          And the lovely Care-Cheri causes....petrifaction!
          But I, and they, quite taken are, so I can't take action...
          Therefore, Ladies, fill my cup; I'll drink to stupefaction!

          Now Atenveldt your fighters, all, are most good and gentle
          And the Ladies, bless 'em all, are most ornamental!
          But that little Nikki-Toad....has me sentimental
          Though with boffer in her hand she is argumental!

          This stupid little song, m'lords, is mostly sung in Latin
          By the Goliards, of course, from vespers clear to matins!
          But I prefer a coarser cloth over silk or satins
          English is more understood, mine enemies to flatten!

          Good People all, I've made my Song, its' music's well-recited
          But my voice could use some work; the flowers it has blighted!
          It's rude and rusty, grim and bad, and squeaky like a door-hinge,
          But I'm a better Bard than you: I found a rhyme for ""orange!""

                      by William Poundstone
                              1983

     Two mentalities are at work here: 1960s rock fans and 1980s
fundamentalist Christians. The idea of phonographically concealed
messages dates from the Paul McCartney death scare of 1969. For
hard-core types, the secret-message rumors never really died. Avid
rock fans have auditioned ever album release since the late 1960s
for hidden nuances. Backward messages, barely audible messages,
and messages on one stereo track only have been alleged. At the
other end of the sociosensual spectrum, fundamentalist Christians
have gotten into the act. TV programs such as PRAISE THE LORD and
THE 700 CLUB have propagated rumors of a satanic plot in the
recording industry, no less, in which various albums conceal
""backward-masked"" demonic murmurings. If THAT sounds too spacey to
be taken seriously, consider that it was the fundamentalist groups
who were behind House Resolution 6363, a bill introduced in the
U.S. House of Representatives by Robert K. Dornan (R., Calif.) in
1982 to label all suspect records: ""WARNING: THIS RECORD CONTAINS
BACKWARD MASKING THAT MAKES A VERBAL STATEMENT WHICH IS AUDIBLE
WHEN THIS RECORD IS PLAYED BACKWARD AND WHICH MAY BE PERCEPTIBLE
AT A SUBLIMINAL LEVEL WHEN THIS RECORD IS PLAYED FORWARD."" In
February 1983, the Arkansas State Senate passed a similar record-
labeling bill by a vote of 86 to 0.
     Contributing to the quasi-occult status of these rumors is
the difficulty of checking them out on home audio equipment. You
pretty much have to take someone else's word for it, or dismiss
the rumors out of hand.
     From a technical standpoint, there are four simple ways to
conceal a verbal message on a recording. The most obvious is to
record the message at a very low volume. The message may then be
recovered by turning the volume up while playing the record or
tape. If the message is faint enough, though, noise levels of home
equipment may garble it. If the accompanying music or lyrics are
loud enough, or if the message itself is indistinct or
electronically modified, it may be hard to hear on any equipment.
     A second gimmick is to record a message on one stereo track
only. Records and tapes have two independent recordings, of
course, normally played simultaneously for stereo effect. On a
record, each stereo track occupies on one side of the V-shaped
groove for the needle. On a tape, the tracks are recorded in
parallel lanes of the magnetic material. The two tracks are called
""right"" and ""left"" after the stereo speakers they will play on.
Otherwise, the tracks are interchangeable -- the sound mixer can
put anything he or she wants on each track. A message on one track
can be masked by simultaneous loud music or lyrics on the opposite
track. With normal stereo balance (or mono equipment) the loud
track drowns out the message track. At home, single-track messages
can be recovered by adjusting the stereo balance so that only the
desired track plays. Sometimes this trick also makes indistinct
words clearer. Even if the words are not exclusively on one track,
they may happen to be more audible on one track.
     A message could be recorded at a speed different from the
rest of the record. Then the record would have to be played faster
or slower than usual to recover the message. Unless the message
was at one of the standard speeds (say, 45 rpm on a 33 1/3 rpm
record), it could not be played normally on home equipment.
     The fourth and most commonly alleged trick is to record a
verbal message backward. Reversed speech has several unexpected
features. One is that syllables are not a constant in the reversal
process. A one-syllable word can have two or three syllables when
played backward. Thus ""number nine"" in the Beatles' REVOLUTION 9
reverses to ""Turn me on, dead man"" (or something like it), a jump
from three to five syllables.
     There is no simple way to predict what a word or phrase will
sound like reversed. Obviously, you can't just reverse the
letters.
     Reversed messages are difficult to recover at home. Record
turntables are not built to go backwards. Some have a neutral
setting, in which the pickup and amplifier remain active and you
can turn the record backward by hand. But hardly anyone has a
stead enough hand to produce satisfactory results.
     With patience, it is possible to reverse a cassette
recording. Transfer the music from the original record or tape
onto a blank tape cassette. Place the cassette flat on a table.
Draw our the part of the tape with the suspected message and snip
it off at both ends. Hold the tape segment horizontally. Rotate it
180 degrees, keep it horizontal at all times. This turns the tape
end for end. Splice the reversed tape segment back onto the two
loose ends of the cassette with strong adhesive tape. Reel the
tape back inside the cassette. The sliced segment will play
backward on an ordinary cassette player.
     I rented a recording studio to test the secret-message
rumors. New copiies of the records in question were transcribed on
a quarter-inch master tape. Where rumor alleged that a single
stereo track contained a message, right and left stereo tracks
were transcribed separately. Records with alleged inaudible
messages were treated similarly. To test claims of reversed
messages, recordings on the master tape were edited out and
spliced in backward. Twenty cuts or portions of cuts from sixteen
albums were tested.


""Another One Bites the Dust""
Queen, THE GAME

Rumor: When played backward, the lyrics say, ""It's fun to smoke
marijuana.""
Findings: There is something that sounds like ""It's fun to smoke
marijuana"" in the reversed music. It is repeated over and over. It
might be rendered no less faithfully, however, as ""sfun to scout
mare wanna."" This ""message"" is the reversal of the song title,
which is repeated as a line in the song.
     Let's make a distinction between engineered and phonetic
reversals. When an artist records a verbal statement, reverses it
by turning the tape end for end, mixes the reversed statement onto
a master tape, and has records and tapes produced from the master,
that is an engineered reversal. When the phonetic properties of
song lyrics are such that they can be reversed to sound like
something else, that is a phonetic reversal.
     ""It's fun to smoke marijuna"" is clearly a phonetic reversal.
The lyrics are perfectly plain played forward (""Another one bites
the dust""), no so plain played backward (""sfun to scout mare
wanna""). With an engineered reversal, the opposite should hold
true: gibberish forward, clear as a bell backward. Some are
prepared to believe that phonetic reversals are just as
intentional as engineered reversals -- that the songwriter
painstakinginly planned the phonetic double-entendre. In the
absence of confirming evidence, that just doesn't wash. It's too
easy to find coincidences. If, for example, the letters of the
alphabet are recited in conventional fashion (Ay, Bee, Cee, etc.)
and reversed, at least five sound like English language words. D
reverses to ""eden,"" F becomes ""pray,"" S becomes ""say,"" V becomes
""even,"" and Z becomes ""easy."" ""It's fun to smoke marijuana"" is
likewise a coincidence.


""A Child is Coming""
Jefferson Starship, BLOWS AGAINST THE EMPIRE

Rumor: When played backward, ""son of Satan.""
Findings: Another phonetic coincidence. The repeated ""It's getting
better"" reverses to an iffy ""son of Satan,"" the ""of"" drawn out and
the ""Satan"" strongly accented on the first syllable.


""Eldorado""
Electric Light Orchestra, ELDORADO

Rumor: When played backward, ""He is the nasty one/ Christ, you're
infernal/ It is said we're dead men/ Everyone who has the mark
will live.""
Findings: Coincidence. The supposed message lurks around the line
""On a voyage of no return to see."" Reversed, this passage becomes
the expected syllable salad -- no one hearing it would describe it
as anything but reversed music. Only if you listen while reading
along with what you're supposed to hear will you get anything. The
rumored version of the message is somewhat fudged. The passage
sounds more like ""He's to nasty one/ Christ you are, Christ,
you're fernal/ There wiss uh, we're dead men..."" There is no ""in""
in what is taken to be ""infernal."" The line that is supposed to be
""Everyone who has the mark will live"" isn't even close, though the
syllable count is right.


""Shoo Be Doo""
The Cars, CANDY-O

Rumor: When played backward, the word ""Satan"" repeated
approximately eleven times.
Findings: Coincidence. The rumor refers to the reversal of the ""Shoo
be doo, shoo be doo, shoo be doo..."" near the end of the song. Given
the mysterious logic of reversed phonemes, these three-syllable units
can be hard as a repeated two-syllable word. The word sounds a little
like ""Satan.""


""Snowblind""
Styx, PARADISE THEATER

Rumor: According to a mimeographed list of suspect records distributed
by Congressman Dornan, the words ""Satan move through our voices"" when
played backwards.
Findings: Negative. Despite repeated listenings, it was not even
possible to identify the part of the reversed track that Dornan et al.
are talking about.


""Stairway to Heaven""
Led Zeppelin, untitled, a.k.a. STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN

Rumor: In reverse, ""I live for Satan... The Lord turns me off...
There's no escaping it... Here's to my sweet Satan... There's power in
Satan... He will give you 666.""
Findings: Coincidence. If you listen very carefully to the ""And it
makes me wonder"" lines in reverse, you'll hear something approaching
""There's no escaping it."" A better description is ""There's no escape
do."" Knock of the last syllable, and you have ""There's no escape,"" a
complete, intelligible sentence in reverse. It's there, all right, but
it's not an unlikely enough coincidence to -- well, make you wonder.
      The ""Satan"" in ""I live for Satan"" is good and clear. The ""I live
for"" part isn't. The other alleged lines are unremarkable. All are
phonetic reversals of the entirely lucid forward lyrics and obviously
just accidents.


""When Electricity Came to Arkansas""
Black Oak Arkansas, BLACK OAK ARKANSAS and RONCH AND ROLL

Rumor: In reverse, ""Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan. He is God. He
is God.""
Findings: The BLACK OAK ARKANSAS cut was reversed. Again, pairs of
reversed syllables are being freely interpreted as ""Satan."" ""He is
God"" was not identifiable.


""Rain""
The Beatles, HEY JUDE

Rumor: Unintelligible lyrics at the end are reversed.
Findings: A true engineered reversal and not really a secret. ""Rain""
seems to have been the first popular recording to incorporate an
obviously reversed lyric. The story is that John Lennon accidentally
spliced the last part of the song in backward and liked the effect.
When reversed, the strange-sounding vocals at the end become
intelligible as a reprise starting with the drawn-out word
""sunshine.""
      The reversal is less apparent to the casual listener than it
might be because the accompanying music is not reversed. The ending
fits in smoothly with the rest of the song, the vocals suggesting a
foreign language.


""Fire on High""
Electric Light Orchestra, FACE THE MUSIC

Rumor: When played backward, ""The music is reversible, but time --
turn back!""
Findings: ""Fire on High"" is instrumental. About twenty-six seconds
into the music, scrambled speech is heard. It is mostly louder than
the accompanying music and begins with a two-syllable unit repeated
several times. The seeming speech lasts for about fourteen seconds.
      Reversing the music confirms that there is a true, engineered
message. In reverse, a voice (Jeff Lynne's?) says, ""The music is
reversible, but time -- turn back! Turn back! Turn back! Turn back!""
All the words are clear and unambiguous. Anyone comparing this to the
alleged reversal on ELO's ""Eldorado"" will have no trouble telling
which is genuine.


""Goodbye Blue Sky""
Pink Floyd, THE WALL

Rumor: In reverse, ""You have discovered the secret message.""
Findings: The ""secret message"" is at the very end of the instrumental
passage following the ""Goodbye Blue Sky"" vocals. It comes just before
the words ""What shall we do"" at the start of the song that is
identified as ""Empty Spaces"" on the record label and as ""What shall we
do now?"" on the record sleeve. Played forward, the message is less
apparent than the FACE THE MUSIC reversal: A reasonably attentive
listener might play THE WALL through and not catch it. It suggests
speech not quite close enough to be overheard. In context this is not
unusual because the ""Goodbye Blue Sky"" instrumental passage includes
""airport noises"" and other sound effects. A loud climax in the music
further masks the unintelligible voice.
      When played backward, the voice (Roger Waters?) plainly intones,
""Congratulations, you have just discovered the secret message. Please
send your answer to old Pink, care of the funny farm..."" As the voice
fades out, there may be another word -- perhaps ""Chalfonte or
""Chelsea"" -- after ""funny farm.""


""Heavy Metal Poisoning""
Styx, KILROY WAS HERE

Rumor: A red sticker on the KILROY WAS HERE cover warns, ""By order of
the Majority for Musical Morality, this album contains secret backward
messages...""
Findings: This is a case of second-generation backward-masking. Styx'
PARADISE THEATER did not contain a backward message, though a lot of
people said it did. So Styx has included a sure enough backward
message on KILROY WAS HERE. It is at the very beginning of ""Heavy
Metal Poisoning."" The reversed speech last about three seconds. There
is no musical background. The words reverse to ""Annuit coeptis. Novus
ordo seclorum."" This is the Latin motto encircling the pyramid on the
back of a dollar bill. The usual translation: ""God has favored our
undertakings. A new order of the ages.""
      The cover sticker's ""Majority for Musical Morality"" is a
fictitious Falwellesque group in the KILROY WAS HERE video. Although
the sticker suggests a plurality of ""messages,"" only one was found.


Space between ""I'm So Tired"" and ""Blackbird""
The Beatles, untitled, a.k.a. THE WHITE ALBUM

Rumor: A reversed message. At the time of the Paul-is-dead stories,
the segue from ""I'm So Tired"" to ""Blackbird"" was offered as evidence.
It was held to contain John Lennon's voice, reveresed, saying ""Paul is
dead, miss him, miss him, miss him."" That interpretation seems
unlikely now, but there is a mysterious low muttering between the
songs.
Findings: The mumbling is actually just to the ""I'm So Tired"" side of
the shiny ""space"" between cuts on the record. Each of the stereo
tracks was recorded separately, twice, and a copy of each track was
reversed. This produced four versions of the two-second passage: right
forward, left forward, right reversed, and left reversed. All were
equally unintelligible. It was not even apparent whether the voice is
forward or reversed. Nor could John Lennon be identified as the
speaker. There are nine or ten syllables. The first six (when played
forward) are a two-syllable unit repeated three times. There is little
or no difference betwen the stereo tracks. Any claimed interpretation
of the sounds seems doubtful.


""Strawberry Fields Forever""
The Beatles, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR

Rumor: It was, of course, claimed that John Lennon says ""I buried
Paul"" at the end. (It's forward, at the very end after the music
fades to complete silence, returns, and starts to fade out again.)
But Lennon told ROLLING STONE that the words are ""cranberry
sauce.""
Findings: They are ""cranberry sauce."" The ""sauce""/""Paul"" part is
indistinct, but the first syllable sounds a lot more like ""cran""
than ""I.""


""Baby You're a Rich Man""
The Beatles, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR

Rumor: On one of the tracks the line ""Baby you're a rich man too""
is sung as ""Baby you're a rich fag Jew,"" a dig at Brian Epstein.
Or some think it's ""rich fat Jew"" and claim it as evidence of
Beatle anti-Semitism.
Findings: Negative. The two stereo tracks are nearly identical.
It's always possible to hear words as similar-sounding words, but
basically, the lyrics jibe with the published version.


""Revolution 9""
The Beatles, untitled, a.k.a. THE WHITE ALBUM

Rumor: Various reversed and/or one-track speech. The reversal of
""Number nine"" to ""Turn me on, dead man"" has pretty much been
discounted as coincidence (though it appears on Congressman
Dornan's list).
Findings: Distinction between lyrics and any hidden message blurs
on ""Revolution 9."" The eight-minute cut is a montage of sounds
collected by John Lennon and Yoko Ono. It includes discordant
music, radio broadcasts, sirens, applause, gunfights, sports
cheers, the crackling of a fire, screams, a baby gurgling, a choir
singing, and much that cannot be identified. For this
investigation, ""Revolution 9"" was transcribed four times, twice on
each stereo channel. One copy of each of the tracks was reversed.
The four resulting versions were compared with each other and
against the original two-channel version.
     ""Revolution 9"" contains a lot of talking. Played in stereo,
forward, the longest stretch of understandable speech is probably
an announcer saying, ""...every one of them knew that as time went
by they'd get a little bit older and a little bit slower...""
     One believable instance of reversed speech occurs: someone
saying ""Let me out! Let me out!"" (once held to represent McCartney
in his totaled Aston-Martin). Two iffy reversals occur on the
backward recording of the right stereo track:""She used to be
assistant"" and ""There were two men..."" Neither is clear enough or
long enough to be convincing. Some of the music, including the
recurring theme, sounds more natural in reverse.
     ""Turn me on, dead man"" is a typical phonetic reversal. The
forward ""number nine"" (repeated throughout the cut) is clear; the
reversal is slurred -- something like ""turn me on dedmun."" It has
been claimed that ""number nine"" must be pronounced with a British
accent or with some careful inflection in order to reverse to
""Turn me on, dead man."" This seems not to be so. As an experiment,
three American-accent renderings of ""number nine"" were reversed.
All sound about as much like ""Turn me on, dead man"" as the record
did. Like the other phonetic reversals, ""Turn me on, dead man""
must be considered a coincidence.
     Much of ""Revolution 9"" is on one stereo track only. Near the
end a voice says ""A fine natural imbalance...the Watusi...the
twist...Eldorado...Eldorado."" ""A fine natural imbalance"" is on the
right track only, though the words that follow are in stereo. One
of the longer bits of speech -- ""Who could tell what he was
saying? His voice was low and his [unintelligible] was high and
his eyes were low"" -- is clear on the left track, a bare whisper
on the right.
     There is a stereophonically concealed ""secret message"" on
""Revolution 9."" The words are on the right track. They begin about
four minutes, fifty-eight seconds into the cut and run for about
twenty-two seconds. They are not likely to be noticed in stereo
because of the much louder left track. The sound of applause
begins on the left track at about five minutes, one second into
the cut. Deafening noises -- the clapping, sirens, music --
continue on the left track until five minutes, forty seconds. It
may or may not have been Lennon's and Ono's intention to conceal
the spoken passage. Given the haphazard quality of ""Revolution 9,""
the concealment may have been accidental. To recover the passage,
the left track must be switched off. The right track can then be
heard to contain a sound like a stopwatch ticking, behind these
words:

     So the wife called, and we better go to see a
     surgeon....[A SCREAM MUFFLES A LINE THAT SOUNDS LIKE
     Well, what with the prices, the prices have snowballed,
     no wonder it's closed.] ...So any and all, we went to
     see the dentist instead, who gave him a pair of teeth,
     which wasn't any good at all. So instead of that he
     joined the bloody navy and went to sea.
                      by William Poundstone
                              1986

     There really are backward messages on rock albums. And the
controversy over ""backward masking"" and ""porn rock"" has inspired a
whole new spate of messages. There may have been more genuine
backward messages in the past few years than ever before.
     The backward message controversy is usually traced to the
1960s and John Lennon's avant-garde sound mixing on such tracks as
""Revolution 9"" on the Beatles' WHITE ALBUM. Lennon probably wasn't
trying to conceal a message so much as create an interesting
sound.
     The matter might have ended right there had it not been for
the Paul McCartney death rumor. College kids tried playing Beatles
records forward, backward, and at various speeds to find ""clues""
to McCartney's fate. In the process they found snippets of speech
from Lennon's experiments. Even after McCartney was found safe and
sound in Scotland, some listeners continued to look for hidden
messages.
     Somehow, fundamentalist Christian groups became convinced
(ca. 1982) that the alleged messages were commercials for devil
worship. Not a single indisputable satanic message has turned up,
but there were scattered attempts to ban or label certain albums.
In 1986 one fundamentalist group announced that the theme song for
the old MR. ED TV show contains the word ""Satan"" when played
backward.)
     Ironically, the publicity accorded nonexistent messages has
inspired several artists -- among them porn rock hearing witness
Frank Zappa -- to hide real background messages in their music.
It's easy to do.
     The performer speaks or sings the message normally, then
reverses the tape, which is mixed into the soundtrack. This is all
accomplished simply enough at any recording studio.
     What's not so simple is playing it back. More home record,
cassette, and compact disk players won't play backward. You can
turn a record backward with a pencil eraser, but it's not good for
the needle or the turntable. The only way to reproduce the message
with full fidelity is to use a professional-quality reel-to-reel
tape player and splice the tape in backward.
     We used the facilities of KLOS radio in Los Angeles to
reverse some recent records containing true backward messages.


""Secret Messages""
Electric Light Orchestra, SECRET MESSAGES

ELO's ELDORADO album was among those alleged to contain satanic
backward masked messages. A patient listening to ELDORADO played
backward reveals no such messages. You hear only what you ought to
hear -- the reversed lyrics of the songs, which sound nothing like
the ""messages"" claimed to be there. In the wake of such
allegations, ELO did put an (innocuous) backward message on their
FACE THE MUSIC album. Perhaps they thought this would show how
silly the allegations were. Instead, the backward-masking people
seized on this as proof that the other ""messages"" were real. In
the latest volley, ELO has named an album after the controversy.
     In Britain (where the backward-masking issue is viewed as an
American eccentricity), the cover of SECRET MESSAGES has a mock
warning label to youth about the hidden label. Word of the albums'
impending release in the United States caused enough of a furor to
chill CBS Records into deleting the cover blurb.
     The reversed message is easy to find. It's at the beginning
of the first song, which is itself called ""Secret Messages."" You
can hear reversed speech when you play the record normally. A
voice intones ""secret messages"" -- forward -- in the middle of the
reversed speech, lest anyone dare be so unhip as to not know
what's going on.
     We transferred a new copy of SECRET MESSAGES to reel-to-reel
tapes and played it backward. The backward message goes: ""WELCOME
TO THE BIG SHOW/ WELCOME TO THE BIG SHOW.""
     That's it.


""Ya Hozna""
Frank Zappa, THEM OR US

""Ya Hozna,"" a six-minute composition on the first record of the
THEM OR US double album, is ENTIRELY backward. The albums' inner
cover, which includes lyrics for the other songs, says, ""backwards
vocal -- you figure it out"" of this cut. It credits Frank and Moon
Zappa, George Duke, and Napoleon Murphy Brock as vocalists.
     Played forward, ""Ya Howza"" sounds like a record played
backward -- reasonably so. The vocals are prominent and
unintelligible. Moon Zappa's voice is curiously recognizable, even
in reverse. It is hard to tell whether the music was recorded
forward or backward.
     When ""Ya Howza"" is played in reverse, you discover that the
music is virtually a palindrome -- it sounds about the same
forward and backward. The voices are all backward. In some cases
they have been modified electronically. Many of the words are
muffled. Even after repeated careful listening on both stereo
tracks, it is difficult to make out many of the lyrics. It doesn't
help that some of the words seem to be stream-of-consciousness
nonsense. Some of the unintelligible stuff sounds like opera.
     Starting at the beginning of the reversed tape -- the end of
the forward tape -- the clearer vocals go like this: ""I am the
heaven, I am the water."" This is in a hymnlike register. ""You are
a lonely little girl./ But your mommy and your daddy hold you."" A
singsong synthesizer voice.
     The most interesting part of the lyrics is an intermittently
orgasmic rap in Moon Zappa's Valley Girl voice. There are three
short monologues:

I'm like green!
I'm like squat!
I'm like soul!
Repeat, like soul!
I'm like pull, push,
Okay, like slow, slow.

You're never too old
Like slow, like slow, like slow
Okay, I like it.


All right, faster, faster,
Go, do it, do it twice,
Yeah, that feels good,
I'm looking great,
Yeah, fer shure!
Like, no way!


""No Anchovies, Please""
J. Geils Band, LOVE STINKS

""No Anchovies, Please"" is a novelty song, really a narration with
sound effects, about a woman who is kidnapped after eating
anchovies. She is taken to a ""foreign-speaking"" country. The sound
effect of the foreign tongue seems reversed. When you do play it
in reverse, it becomes: ""It doesn't take a genius to know the
difference between chicken shit and chicken salad.""


""Darling Nikki""
Prince, PURPLE RAIN

""Darling Nikki,"" cited as porn rock before Congress, is about a
dominatrix in a hotel lobby masturbating with a magazine. In part,
the complaint was that the album cover (flowers, and Prince on a
motorcycle) wasn't explicit enough to warn kids of the suggestive
lyrics. Senator Paula Hawkins apparently was not aware of a
backward message hidden in ""Darling Nikki."" The last thirty-five
seconds of the song is gibberish. The music changes abruptly and
becomes a repeated glottal sound. Then a two-syllable sound is
repeated twice, something like ""heaven, heaven."" Unintelligible
speech follows. At the end is a sound reminiscent of rain or bacon
frying , and wind sounds.
     Played backward, the message becomes:

     Hello, how are you?
     I'm fine 'cause I know that the Lord is coming soon.
     Coming, coming soon.

     It is clearly Prince and the Revolution singing this. The
words are clear but the intonation is funny -- the linger on some
words. Perhaps this is to make the reversed message you hear
playing the record normally a little less conspicuous.
     This is a weird reversal of the supposed secret message
menace. Raunchy forward lyrics conceal a religious secret message.


""Judas Kiss""
Petra, MORE POWER TO YOU

Petra is an obscure group that sings religious songs to a rock
beat. As further proof that things have gone full circle, the
backward-masking controversy prompted Petra to include a wholesome
backward message on their MORE POWER TO YOU album. It is in the
transition between two songs, just before ""Judas Kiss."" Clearly
audible gibberish reverses to this (the husky voice a cross
between George Beverly Shea and Dee Snider): ""What are you looking
for the Devil for, when you ought to be looking for the Lord?""

AFL JoyceM Welcome to the Apple II Music & Sound chat - our discussion will
           be on NoiseTracker - the new FTA music program for the GS.  AFA
           Gene will be our host this evening...Gene, the floor is yours :)

AFA Gene   Hi all... well first I'd like to point out, if y'all aren't aware
           yet, that a spanking new version of NoiseTracker has recently
           been released (9 days ago) and is now available in our New Files
           library. It is version 0.5. I haven't played around with it much
           yet, but it's supposed to fix a lot of the little bugs in 0.3
           (the first version we had online).  NoiseTracker also includes
           the ability to directly import ""modules,"" a term used for a
           certain type of Amiga song file which has become popular among PC
           users using the SoundBlaster sound card.

           Now, via NT, these ""MOD"" files are accessible by the GS. We
           expect to see a lot of activity on this end as far as ports from
           the PC and Amiga go. Note that you should be able to go straight
           to the PC music forum and download any recently uploaded MOD
           songfiles (there was a bug in the first wide release of the PCAO
           software, however, so a bunch of files with dates between around
           March 1991 and September 1991 may not download properly. Note that
           to use these PC MOD files, you'll have to rename the downloaded
           file ""MOD.xxxxxx"" if you want it to show up automatically in NT's
           ""open"" dialog box. (On the PC, all MOD files are named
           ""xxxxxxxx.MOD"" instead.)   Also, if the files are packed with ZIP
           compression, you'll need a program from the Communications Forum
           called AGATE -- it's a terminal program that includes the ability
           to unpack ZIP files.

           Now, I guess the best thing to do would be to talk about our
           favorite songfiles... there have been a few complaints, in fact,
           that people were not being ""descriptive"" enough in their file
           descriptions for uploads in describing the songs.

AFC Eddie  ?

AFA Gene   GA ed

AFC Eddie  Once a MOD file is unpacked with Agate, is a file type change
           needed?

AFA Gene   Nope, since all that NT looks for is the ""MOD."" being the first
           four characters in the filename.

AFC Eddie  OK, Thanks!

Deanna7332 Question...

JonL7      Can you list some of the features of Noisetracker?

AFA Gene   (you don't even need that ""MOD."" if you want to type the name in
           directly.)

Deanna7332 Did any of these mod files have anything to do with FTA's ""Module
           A""

AFA Gene   Sure Jon, right after we answer Deanna's question. Deanna, you
           mean ""Modulae?""

Deanna7332 Yes, that's it.

AFA Gene   Modulae was a demo written by FTA last year. (i'll get to you in a
           sec Doors).  It used SoundSmith v0.95 for all it's music. There
           is no connection between MOD files and Modulae by FTA.

Deanna7332 Throughout the demo it said ""Loading modules""

AFA Gene   Those ""modules"" are not the same as Amiga soundfile ""modules"" --
           you see, what Modulae really was was a ""stringing together"" of a
           bunch of neat little tiny demos that FTA had written. So they
           called each little demo a ""module"" and thus the entire demo as a
           whole, ""Modulae"" (fancy plural of module?)

Deanna7332 Ok I understand.  Thank you. :)

AFL JoyceM Latin, Gene :)

AFA Gene   The term ""MODule"" from the Amiga comes from the idea that all the
           stuff needed to play the songfile (all the instruments + the
           sequence file) are included into one file, the ""module.""

TheDoors1  Gene, I have tried to d/l some recent uploaded MODs in the PC
           music area and still the problem exists.

AFA Gene   As I understand it, the problem was fixed VERY recently (correct
           me on this Joyce) and files uploaded as recently as early
           November still might not work depending on the version of the
           PCAO software that the uploader used.

AFL JoyceM Actually, Gene...I was under the impression that it had been, but
           if Doors is still having a problem, then it must not be fixed.

AFA Gene   What date was the file you tried to d/l, Door?

TheDoors1  umm 11/17, around there

AFA Gene   hmmm.... well i can tell you one thing... if it didn't work, don't
           waste your time again later... the problem is in the Apple
           software's method of d/lling files, and there are no plans to
           upgrade the Apple AO software.

AFL JoyceM I will endeavor to get an answer to that PC downloading
           problem/question :)

ThomasK63  i have a quick question... what can you use to unpack amiga mod
           files? On the PC side, that is.

TheDoors1  Agate Thomas

ELECTMUSIC Doors... what happens on after downloading..

Deanna7332 If it's LZHed you can't unless you have an IBM or
           PC/Transporter.

AFA Gene   If GS-ShrinkIt doesn't have that ability, i don't think there
           exists any such utility on the GS.

TheDoors1  What do you mean Elect?

ELECTMUSIC After you download the file... where do you encounter a problem?

TheDoors1  ok, you know when you download the file and at some point in the
           download the file starts to appear on your screen.  That's when I
           cancel it.

ThomasK63  I am sure soething good can be made w/out resorting to Amiga
           files

AFC Eddie  Yes, Doors, I believe the problem is with the PC software it was
           UL'd with.

TheDoors1  yeah Eddie.

GNO Tim    Amiga MOD files are typically compressed using LHarc.  I've
           uncompressed several on my Unix machine at school.

ThomasK63  good time for someone to make a lharc unpacker...

AFC DYAJim someone might be ;)

GNO Tim    Several people are already

AFC Eddie  Can't wait, Jim!

AFA Gene   Jon, did you have a question?

JonL7      The features of Noisetracker :)

AFA Gene   Oh yes... okay, here goes, in a nutshell, from most important to
           least:


AFA Gene   *  ability to import MOD files

           *  ability to import Soundsmith files

           *  ProDOS 8 based

           *  virtually no editing abilities (not a feature but important to
           know)

AFC DYAJim :)

AFA Gene   *  forgot: and the most important feature of all, the ability to
           hold instrument files in regular system RAM instead of DOC RAM,
           allowing for instruments far beyond the regular 64K limit found
           in ALL other GS music programs.

ThomasK63  I'll buy that!

TheDoors1  I have another question...when you're ready.

AFA Gene   GA Doors

TheDoors1  ok..is it true that NoiseTracker will take in soundsmith files and
           play them more clearly

AFA Gene   Well, as far as ""what you hear,"" yes there is a definite
           difference with some instruments. It does NOT play the sounds
           more ""clearly,"" but it just plays them in a different way. What
           many people seem to like about this ""different way"" is that
           sustained instruments (i.e. instruments designed to be played
           in a loop to simulate a long held note) seem to work better (or
           perhaps simply the way they were originally intended to work).

TheDoors1  I see

Deanna7332 Which takes up more space - MOD or NT  w/soundfile ?

AFA Gene   Deanna, it depends a few things, such as how big the sequence is,
           how many instruments you have, etc. Once you have a lot of
           assorted files, it'll probably average out to be about the same
           give or take a hundred blocks on your HD. So it basically depends
           on whether you prefer to have your instruments separate or not.

Deanna7332 Does playing quality differ with either one ?

AFA Gene   Nope. It's exactly the same either way. Loading time is the same
           too.

AFC Eddie  Can NT save songs as MOD files?

AFA Gene   Nope. It has options for Open and Close module, but these are
           still inactive.

AFA Gene   If there are no more questions, I'd like to talk about which NT
           files out there are the ""hottest,"" since this info could be
           useful to many users who are interested in downloading NT/MOD
           files.

           My personal favorite is ""Lambada,"" which is supplied by FTA with
           the program but is available separately on America
           Online.Everything about this file is really impressive except
           perhaps the sound quality of the horn-ish melody instrument.

           What about y'all, what are your favorite NT files?

AFL JoyceM Gene, there is a classical song for NT, but can't remember the
           name, but it is good.

AFC Eddie  I like Dragnet!

ELECTMUSIC So do I Ed

TheDoors1  I like Seven something

Deanna7332 My most favorite of all mod files is Pleasure Principle

AFC Eddie  <--appreciate's Greg's taste!

AFL JoyceM :)

AFA Gene   Deanna, i assume you got that from a local board?

Deanna7332 I got it from the PC forum here.

TheDoors1  I saw it there also

Deanna7332 I think under ""Pleasure""

AFA Gene   Would you be able to upload it here? If it's really that good, we
           ought to have it available directly in our oun NT lib here (BTW
           folks, we will be releasing a new NoiseTracker software library
           soon!)

AFC Eddie  What a Forum!!!

Deanna7332 That sounds great!

AFL JoyceM Gene, do you think it will be possible for synthLAB files to be
           converted to MOD files?

AFL JoyceM MOD files?

AFA Gene   I doubt it, Joyce. The formats are so diametrically opposed in
           their entire basis of their file formats that it wouldn't be
           worth the time for a programmer to develop such a convertor.

Deanna7332 Isn't it possible to move the mod file from the PC forum to our
           music library?

AFA Gene   But..... it might be worth the time for a MIDI File Format to MOD
           convertor, since these two formats are more widely accepted.

Nuzz       they have nothing better to do Gene

ELECTMUSIC Gene.. some interesting similarities with DTune and NTracker

AFA Gene   They lose the file, tho, Deanna. :)

AFL JoyceM In what way, Greg?

ELECTMUSIC Both Prodos 8

Deanna7332 Shhh they won't know a thing :)

ELECTMUSIC I also believe Bill uses a shuttling of sound data between Doc
           Ram and Ram.

AFC Eddie  Interesting, Greg.

ELECTMUSIC Thats how he gets some of the excellent instrument quality

AFC Eddie  But Diversitune has that one distinction:  MIDI input.

AFL JoyceM Deanna, we would greatly appreciate it if you would upload that
           'Pleasure' song to our library :)

ELECTMUSIC Agreed Ed.. one of the factors FTA doesn't like to incorporate
           into their programs.

Deanna7332 I'll u/l it tonight if possible.

AFL JoyceM Thanks :)

AFC Eddie  Thanks, Deanna!

AFL JoyceM I will send Bill B a copy of NoiseTracker + some MOD files...to
           see what comments we get from him (will send when I get back).

AFC DYAJim What ever happened to that diversitune upgrade that was talked
           about ?

ELECTMUSIC That would be interesting Joyce

AFC Eddie  Bill apparently still working on it, Jim.

ELECTMUSIC I am sure he would appreciate the Prodos 8

AFC DYAJim good..

AFL JoyceM Jim...RSN....he was hoping by Christmas (this year), but he is
           soooo busy with his job, who knows?

AFC DYAJim Oh yeah, I noticed the speed calcuation in NT .5 is inaccurate
           :)

AFC DYAJim I recall he has set a lot of Christmas projected dates :)

ELECTMUSIC He was one of the first ""Free Tools"" experts in breaking all the
           rules for economic sake.

AFC DYAJim like for the vaporware DT inst editor like 2 years ago.

Deanna7332 Are there any Christmas Mod or NT songs?

AFC Eddie  Oh yeah, Diversi-Editor!

AFL JoyceM I know, Jim - but that I know he has been working on.

AFC DYAJim he projected Christmas for it, and it never came :)

AFA Gene   Not yet in AMS, but hopefully the Holiday Contest will change all
           that. :)

AFC DYAJim I look foreward to any upgrades..

AFL JoyceM Not that I am aware of Deanna - you have some?  hint, hint

Deanna7332 Nope sorry.  I was hoping there were some that could be u/led
           here

AFC DYAJim I'll be breaking out the xmas tune book rsn.. I should be able to
           midi a few :) (which rules out nt)

AFL JoyceM Question...

AFC Eddie  It would be more appropriate to have a converter from Appleworks
           spreadsheet to MOD than from MIDI!

AFL JoyceM If I got ahold of an Amiga song (MOD) disk...how would I convert
           them for here?

AFA Gene   You mean an Amiga-formatted disk?

AFL JoyceM Yes

AFC DYAJim Ack.. methinks you need an amiga and a null modem cable or a
           modem.

AFA Gene   Methinks Jim is right

AFC DYAJim LOL!!  Design your music in the spreadsheet then import to NT :)
           IT might actually have better editing?!! :)

AFC Eddie  Right!

AFL JoyceM Me thinks he is right.  If I had them upload to me, would that
           work?

AFA Gene   Yep; should work like a charm.

AFC DYAJim Yah.. as long as they're coming from an amiga

AFL JoyceM Great....I will work on that when I get back  (making note now).

AFL JoyceM Gene, will you get some of those files (NT) sent to that area
           tonight?  If so, I will leave the needed message :)

AFA Gene   That's all I have planned for tonight's chat, Joyce. Yep, I'll
           move some files right now.

AFL JoyceM Thanks...

AFL JoyceM Then we should have our NoiseTracker Library by end of the week in
           AMS :)

ELECTMUSIC Gene... quick question:  Are you launching NTracker from a 3.5
           disk?

AFL JoyceM Okay, guys...I will see you all the week of December 11th (may the
           4th) as I am off on vacation.

AFA Gene   Yep greg

AFC JohnC  Where are you going?

ELECTMUSIC Do you encounter out of memory problems

AFL JoyceM Night all...and Gene, thanks for an excellent chat and great
           explanations of NoiseTracker.

Nuzz       Joyce, I have good news for FutureSound owners. SoundConvert will
           support it in the first release

AFC Eddie  Great, Mike!

AFA Gene   Greg, i always keep my RAMdisk at 0 when using noisetracker. Not
           only are

AFC JohnC  Mike...SoundConvert...released?

AFL JoyceM Great, Mike.  When can we get SoundConvert, Mike? and FutureSound
           :)

AFA Gene   there a couple of bugs with memory management, but if you're
           loading in a MOD file that's really big, NT will eat your RAMdisk.

AFC Eddie  Sounds good.

Nuzz       The manual is being ""layout"". Release date should be about 1st
           week of Dec

ELECTMUSIC Tnxs Gene

AFC JohnC  YES.......WTG Nuzz!!!!!!!!

Deanna7332 Yes, why is there on some MOD files a stop somewhere in the middle
           ?

Deanna7332 That's really frustrating!

AFL JoyceM Mike, leave me E-Mail on when and how I can send your the $$ to
           get it.

AFL JoyceM Again...night all

Nuzz       gee John, I had to do something to explain the delay :)

ELECTMUSIC Thanks Gene for a GREAT chat!

AFC Eddie  Yes, Gene!  Great!

AFA Gene   Thanks Greg, 'night!

AFA Gene   thanx, see y'all later :)

Copyright 1987 Bob Szekely.

    John Michael Osbourne, (known as ""Ozzy"" to his fans), has in his long 
career as vocalist for Black Sabbath had his work with the group misconstrued 
as advocating Satanism.  In a 1983 radio special featuring Ozzy, the 
interviewer expressed precisely this point; ""...Ozzy has always been shrouded 
in the darkest of Satanic imagery.  Yet if you really listen to his music, 
you'll find that what he is saying differs greatly from his image....""(1)  Even 
the group's image has often been described as ""occult and diabolic"".(2)

    The important point to remember here is to differentiate between appearance 
and reality.  Although the name ""Black Sabbath"" conjures up images of witches 
and sorcerers paying homage to Satan for the powers bestowed upon them, this 
does not make it safe to assume that the group that went by this name 
necessarily drew the inspiration from the occult.(3)  The closest they ever 
came to it was a gothic horror film featuring Boris Karloff as narrator; they 
adopted their name directly from the name of this film.(4)  Black Sabbath was 
involved in the black arts as much as Karloff practiced casting spells off-
screen.  Tony Iommi, the group's guitarist, summed it up best when he described 
the group as having basically ""...the same appeal as a horror movie.  It's all 
an act.""(5)










    Just as their film counterpart did, Ozzy and Sabbath found the occult 
mythos to be an effective vehicle for powerful social commentary; particularly 
when put in the context of heavy-metal rock and roll.  Ozzy himself noted that 
there are ""...people who pick up my [album] cover[s] and go...'This guy's got 
to be singing about Devil, doom, death and destruction.'  Which is not the 
case....""(6)

    The late Lester Bangs likened the group to Bob Dylan and William Burroughs, 
describing them all as ""...moralists...trying to deal with a serious present 
situation in an honest way....""(7)  Ozzy and Black Sabbath merely bring to 
light the many evils of our world in their work, to try and make us realize 
that we are all victim to their influence.  They hope to make us recognize 
these evils so that we may take up arms against them; a point Ozzy emphatically 
stresses:  ""...one thing everybody has got to understand about Black Sabbath's 
lyrics.  They're not downer lyrics, they're just telling everybody where it's 
at...""(8)  He also cites the group's most controversial tune, ""Black Sabbath"", 
as a response to the ignorant hippie culture still force when the tune was 
written in 1970:  ""The hippies said: 'The world is beautiful man.' (sic)  You 
only had to look around you to see how crappy it was.  It was ridiculous 
listening to that stuff, let alone playing it, so we just wrote about the world 
the way it really was and how it affected us - and we felt better in ourselves 
because we were really being honest....""(9)

    I   1   HAVE YOU EVER THOUGH ABOUT YOUR SOUL-
        2   CAN IT BE SAVED?
        3   OR PERHAPS YOU THINK THAT WHEN YOU ARE DEAD
        4   YOU JUST STAY IN YOUR GRAVE.
        5   IS GOD JUST A THOUGHT WITHIN YOUR HEAD OR IS
        6   HE A PART OF YOU?
        7   IS CHRIST JUST A NAME THAT YOU READ IN A BOOK
        8   WHEN YOU WERE AT SCHOOL?

    II  9   WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT DEATH DO YOU LOSE
        10  YOUR BREATH OR DO YOU KEEP YOUR COOL?
        11  WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE THE POPE ON THE END
        12  OF A ROPE - DO YOU THINK HE'S A FOOL?
        13  WELL I'VE SEEN THE TRUTH - YES I'VE SEEN 
        14  THE LIGHT AND I'VE CHANGED MY WAYS.
        15  AND I'LL BE PREPARED WHEN YOU'RE LONELY 
        16  AND SCARED AT THE END OF OUR DAYS.

    III 17  COULD IT BE YOU'RE AFRAID OF WHAT YOU'R
        18  FRIENDS MIGHT SAY 
        19  IF THEY NEW YOU BELIEVED IN GOD ABOVE
        20  THEY SHOULD REALISE BEFORE THE CRITICISE
        21  THAT GOD IS THE ONLY WAY TO LOVE.

    IV  23  IS YOUR MIND SO SMALL THAT YOU HAVE TO FALL
        24 IN WITH THE PACK WHEREVER THEY RUN
        25  WILL YOU STILL SNEER WHEN DEATH IS NEAR
        26  AND SAY THEY MAY AS WELL WORSHIP THE SUN.

    V   27  I THINK IT WAS TRUE IT WAS PEOPLE LIKE YOU
        28  THAT CRUCIFIED CHRIST
        29  I THINK IT IS SAD THE OPINION YOU HADE WAS THE
        30  ONLY ONE VOICED.
        31  WILL YOU BE SO SURE WHEN YOUR DAY IS NEAR
        32  SAY YOU DON'T BELIEVE?
        33  YOU HAD THE CHANCE BUT YOU TURNED IT DOWN
        34  NOW YOU CAN'T RETRIEVE.










    VI  35  PERHAPS YOU'LL THINK BEFORE YOU SAY THAT
        36  GOD IS DEAD AND GONE
        37  OPEN YOUR EYES, JUST REALIZE THAT HE IS THE
        38  ONE.
        39  THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN SAVE YOU KNOW FROM
        40  ALL THIS SIN AND HATE.
        41  OR WILL YOU STILL JEER AT ALL YOU HEAR?
        42  YES!-I THINK IT'S TOO LATE.

    In this piece, the group asserts a belief in an afterlife and spiritual 
redemption.  As grisly as the image of a hanged pontiff is, its shock value is 
a necessary part of the message:  They reject religious dogma, stating that a 
belief in God, in one's own heart, is the only guiding light to help one inn 
his life (lines 11/12, 39/40).  Furthermore, the reject religious hypocrisy 
(lines 5/6, 7/8) and peer pressure (verses III, IV) as excuses for not 
accepting God.  To clarify further:  following the crowd does not justify 
shrugging responsibility for one's own actions.

    After re-reading, it becomes obvious that this song is an ascerbic critique 
of atheism; (line 35/36) I refer here again to verses three and four.  In these 
two verses, the picture painted in one of Godless conformity and how it's 
viewed as being as foolish as Paganism.  These lyrics set an example for the 
listener by relating personal experience (lines 13-16).  However, for those who 
cannot accept this the group has no recourse but to condemn them, although 
rather ironically; they hope that their rhetorical loss of faith in the 
listener will open his eyes (line 42).










                           B L A C K   S A B B A T H 



            WHAT IS THIS, THAT STANDS BEFORE ME?
            FIGURE IN BLACK, WHICH POINTS AT ME
            TURN ROUND QUICK AND START TO RUN
            FIND OUT I'M THE CHOSEN ONE.  OH, NO!
            
            BIG BLACK SHAPE WITH EYES OF FIRE
            TELLING PEOPLE THEIR DESIRE
            SATAN'S SITTING THERE, HE'S SMILING
            WATCHES THOSE FLAMES GET HIGHER AND HIGHER
            OH, NO, NO, -- PLEASE GOD HELP ME!
            
                IS THIS THE END MY FRIEND?
                SATAN'S COMING 'ROUND THE BEND
                PEOPLE RUNNING 'CAUSE THEY'RE SCARED
                THE PEOPLE BETTER GO AND BEWARE
                NO, NO!  PLEASE--NO!!
                
                
    The all time controversy winner!  Is this not irrefutably  THE song about 
Black Magic in rock?  It's all so obvious, suffuse with evil imagery; Satan, 
walls of flame, figure in black, and damnation at the end.  Yes, I see the 
images too; it definitely concerns Black Magic.  Then again, Shakespeare's 
Macbeth employed scenes of witches involved in conjurations; does that mean 
that Shakespeare was a warlock?  Poe used to write sardonic tragedies about 
twisted murderers and the bizarre nature of acts, did that make him an evil, 
leering, demented killer?  Did either of them advocated what they wrote about?  
One has to remember that writing about something is not necessarily the same as 
emulating it.  Tony Iommi spoke out quite strongly about this:  ""People are 
bringing us down saying that we are a Black Magic group.  I think they must be










getting mixed up with Black Widow.  We don't do any sacrifices on stage, and 
we're not on a black magic kick.  We wanted to do heavy numbers and the guitar 
riffs we worked out were more suited to evil things than love.  We play songs 
about black magic, but they are more likely to be against than for it.""(12)  

    By now, you're probably asking yourself who Black Widow is, right?  Then 
it's time for a little history:

        Sabbath, before they were known as Sabbath, had the same line-up but 
two earlier names.  The first one was Polka Tulk, which seemed sure to doom 
them to obscurity.(13)  The soon realized this and changed the group's name to 
Earth.  Now, Earth was a blues band at the end of the English blues boom.  As 
if that wasn't bad enough, they soon discovered that not only was there another 
group named Earth, but they had also released a single.  To avoid confusion, 
they changed their name again.(14)  But what made them decide on that name?  
Just ask Ozzy:  ""I just liked the name Black Sabbath because of the succession 
of vowel sounds.(15)  If that sounds ludicrous just consider this:  Sabbath was 
""...the first of the really committed, loud and heavy bands...""(16)  They 
needed a name to match the gut-wrenching power they were developing.  Tony knew 
that he wanted Sabbath to be noticed above all the rest of the British blues 
bands:  ""We wanted something of our own that we'd like and people would like.  
And we wanted something loud!""










    Tony didn't hate the blues.  He'd cut his teeth as a guitarist on the likes 
of The Shadows, Buddy Holly and Django Rheinhardt, developing his own style 
from there.  But he realized the group had no future in the blues:

        'We couldn't keep playing 12-bars forever.  We just got fed up with 
Earth music.  It was jazz, blues stuff.  It was good for practice but nothing 
else.'

    In the late 'Sixties, blues groups were a dime a dozen in Birmingham and 
interest was waning in the blues boom due to the glut of groups.  One man, by 
the name of Jim Simpson, had heard Earth around the Birmingham club circuit and 
understood what they were trying to do.  He decided to take them under his 
wing.  With the aid of his massive record collection, Jim expanded the group's 
horizons in the areas of jazz and blues.  He introduced them to artists like 
Wes Montgomery, Count Basie and Jimmy Rushing.  It was from Rushing in 
particular that they derived the repetitive riff style so readily noticeable in 
their later incarnation as Black Sabbath.

    The Count Basie influence is evidenced in the song ""Wicked World"" from the 
first album; Sabbath drummer Bill Ward uses a ""'sighing hi-hat'...in the manner 
of Basie's drummer Jo Jones.""










    The influence is subtle, almost subliminal.  Yet it is one which was not 
thought capable of hard, 'heavy' rock bands in the late 'Sixties.  Although Led 
Zeppelin and Jimi Hendrix also had their work steeped in blues and jazz 
derivations (Hendrix' ""Third Stone From the Sun"" and Zeppelin's version of 
Willie Dixon's ""I Can't Quit You Baby"" from their first album), neither was 
able to match the intense energy of Black Sabbath.  Iommi has always had a 
preference for music with an original, distinct style of its' own; as an 
example, he mentions guitarists Joe Pass and Alvin Lee as two of his strongest 
songwriting influences.

    It would also be necessary that Sabbath develop a unique, distinctive style 
and image of their own.  Though they had changed their name from Earth to Black 
Sabbath to avoid confusion with the other Earth; at the same time another group 
emerged by the name of Black Widow ""...who WERE profoundly influenced by the 
occult, had a male witch as a patron, and wrote pieces like ""Come to The 
Sabbat.""  Unfortunately, Sabbath was constantly reaping the benefits of Widow's 
publicity.

    Sabbath was a group that never minced words.  If they saw something as 
destructive, they would be sure to rub the listener's face it it.  They did not 
want their point to be missed.

    With their straightforward, sometimes brutal way of looking at things, they 
try to shock the listener's conscience back into awareness.  The imagery of 
""Hand of Doom"", from the Paranoid album, is candid and condemning; it is a 
strong statement against drug addiction and rightly so...

    Many people felt the group's overall direction was pessimistic and had a 
negative effect on its listener's due to that.  ""Ozzy insisted that if people 
thought he was having a bad effect on the minds of young kids, they should go 
and watch the TV news where real murder and mayhem were a way of life, and 
shown night after night."" (18)

    Sabbath was never negative in their message; they were simply truthful 
about waht they saw as wrong in the world.  If you ""Strip away the horror 
stories, the imagery and the hysteria, (and) turn down the amps a notch...you 
have a well-rehearsed, solid blues and rock band, powered by a dedication to 
well defined objectives.""  On the top of the list of those objectives was 
truth; Sabbath never feared facing that truth squarely, regardless of what many 
people thought of them.

X-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-X
Long, long, time ago,
I can still remember,
When the local calls were ""free"".
And I knew if I paid my bill,
And never wished them any ill,
That the phone company would let me be...

But Uncle Sam said he knew better,
Split 'em up, for all and ever!
We'll foster competition:
It's good capital-ism!

I can't remember if I cried,
When my phone bill first tripled in size.
But something touched me deep inside,
The day... Bell System... died.

And we were singing...

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

Is your office Step by Step,
Or have you gotten some Crossbar yet?
Everybody used to ask...
Oh, is TSPS coming soon?
IDDD will be a boon!
And, I hope to get a Touch-Tone phone, real soon...

The color phones are really neat,
And direct dialing can't be beat!
My area code is ""low"":
The prestige way to go!

Oh, they just raised phone booths to a dime!
Well, I suppose it's about time.
I remember how the payphones chimed,
The day... Bell System... died.

And we were singing...

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

Back then we were all at one rate,
Phone installs didn't cause debate,
About who'd put which wire where...
Installers came right out to you,
No ""phone stores"" with their ballyhoo,
And 411 was free, seemed very fair!

But FCC wanted it seems,
To let others skim long-distance creams,
No matter 'bout the locals,
They're mostly all just yokels!

And so one day it came to pass,
That the great Bell System did collapse,
In rubble now, we all do mass,
The day... Bell System... died.

So bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

I drove on out to Murray Hill,
To see Bell Labs, some time to kill,
But the sign there said the Labs were gone.
I went back to my old CO,
Where I'd had my phone lines, years ago,
But it was empty, dark, and ever so forlorn...

No relays pulsed,
No data crooned,
No MF tones did play their tunes,
There wasn't a word spoken,
All carrier paths were broken...

And so that's how it all occurred,
Microwave horns just nests for birds,
Everything became so absurd,
The day... Bell System... died.

So bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

We were singing:

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?

I hear Valkyries a-comin                There are people into Voodoo
In the air their song is comin          there are people into Voodoo

But they're good enough for me!         and it's good enough for me!

We will venerate Bubastis             We will read from the Kabahlah

We will all bow down to Enlil       There are some who practice Shinto
We will all bow down to Enlil       there are some who practice Shinto
Pass your Cup and get a refill!     there's no telling what WE'RE into!
With bold Gilgamesh the Brave!      but that's good enough for me!

We will all see Aphrodite               We will all sing Hare Krishna
Though she's pretty wild and flighty    We will all sing Hare Krishna
She will meet us in her nightie         It's not mentioned in the Mishna
And she's good enough for me!           But it's good enough for me!

It was good enough for Loki         We will all go to Nirvana

Here's to those who copy Conan    There will be a lot of lovin
Here's to those who copy Conan    when we're meetin in our Coven
They're just Followers of Onan    Quit yer pushin and yer shovin
and that's good enough for me!    So there's room enough for me!

We will have a mighty Party           It was good enough for Sappho
In the honor of Astarte               With her lady on her lap-o
Grab your chiton - don't be tardy     She put Lesbos on the map-o
'Cause she's good enough for me!      With her pagan poetry!

Shall we sing a verse for Venus,    Well the Christians all are humming
Of the Gods she is the meanest,     Cause they say their God is coming,
Cause she bit me on my...elbow      Our God came three times this evening
And it's good enough for me.        And that's good enough for me.

   Now here's a story, a little bit gory,
   A little bit happy, a little bit sad.
   About a drink called Imperium Compound
   And how the SCA's been had!                       

   Chorus: Oh we think, we think, we think,
           The King is a fink, a fink, a fink,
           A figure of respectability
           Rules the Kingdom thru Imperium Compound
           The results are plain to see!

   Mongol Hordemen, those free-living swordsmen
   Subverting the Kingdoms from underneath!
   Have no use for Imperium Compound
   Except perhaps to brush their teeth!

   AltChorus: Oh we fink, we fink, we fink,
              The Khan and the Kink, the Kink, the Kink,
              And the Board, their Great Senilities!
              The Western Irgun, drinks Imperium Compound
              And we're BACK, with results you'll see!    

   Lady Laurel, with Authority Royal,
   Passes and rejects our heraldry
   She needs a swig of Imperium Compound
   Then perhaps she'd deign to talk to me!            

   Lady Trude thought it her duty
   To turn a social wrong into a Right
   Proved her point with Imperium Compound
   And showed that Cheshire Cats can fight!  //and scratch//

   The Board of Directors styled themselves The Electors
   And another con they tried to swing
   Now the BoD drinks Imperium Compound
   So we no longer need a King!                        

   AltChorus: Oh the Bod, the BoD, the BoD,
              It thinks it is God, is God, is God,
              The figure of Supreme Authority!
              And if we O.D.'d on Imperium Compund
              there'd be no need for Royalty!          

   Oh, MEDIEVAL Net, we thought it was all wet
   With witty remarks, and other kinds of sass
   We'll feed our computers on Imperium Compound
   And BYTE the BoD right on its' righteous ass!         

   Good old Duncan was often drunken
   Chasing all the ladies fair
   He bathed himself in Imperium Compound
   Now he has a little savoir faire!

              And it works the best when it is underground!

   Stephan von Geist, was most awful nice,
   And a chivalrous fighter without any doubt
   Took a swig of Imperium Compound
   And won the Crown his first time out!                    

   All the Crusadenes were big, but not mean,
   And the finest fighters in the town.
   But they all drank Jerusalem Compound,
   Winning Crown after Crown after Crown!                 

   Good Duke Arthur couldn't get no farth-er
   A Norman King in Aten Land
   Drank too much of Imperium Compound
   And went off to conquer Engel-land!                    

   Then King Richard, a bit of a bitch, heard
   A King's Crown could be done.
   Drank a little Imperium Compound
   And became the Aten King, first one!                    

   Duchess Malinda, who doesn't do windas,
   But she does a lot of Duchess Things,
   But give her a LOT of Imperium Compound,
   And she sings and sings and sings and sings and sings!   

   Duke Sir Brion, with his pretty white suit on,
   Is a model of goodness and purity
   Never touches Imperium Compound
(spoken:) And I'll sell ya seashore property in Yuma, too!  

   Optional last verse:

   Many tales abound of Imperium Compound
   And its' strange effects on Royalty,
   But after an hour, this song has no power,
   And by now, it's boring ME!                            

   AltChorus: Oh it's too long, too long, too long
              To sing the whole song, the song, the song
              Longer than a Royal Court, it is!
              But sing it serial, this ditty Imperial
              And you'll be a bardic whiz!

        Last night I had the strangest dream in this bleak century
        I dreamed that people the world around believed in Chivalry

        I dreamed I saw a Kingly Crown enshrined in laurel leaves
        with Grace and Joy and Purity attendant at his feet

        I dreamed I saw the perfect Knight receive his accolade
        and minstrels sang and children laughed in some soft forest glade

        I dreamed I saw the finest thing that ever man could make
        grow great and strong and undefiled: Pray God I never wake!

        Last night I had the strangest dream in this bleak century
        I dreamed that people the world around believed in Chivalry

               (to the tune of ""Good King Wenceslaus"")

                Locksley Monsters never yield
                on the field of battle
                strike the helm and bash the shield
                make their eyeteeth rattle
                Bodies on the ground will lie
                bones will burst in sunder
                search for Locksleys' enemies:
                You'll find them six feet under!

                              SONG OF IVANOF

            There is a man who we know well that does the best he can
            but he's displayed in armour made of reticulated garbage cans!

            He looks so fine and fair and strong, oh how he plays the man
            and how it's prized, those galvanized, reticulated garbage cans

            The noblest Roman of them all, a good Praetorian
            a combatant who wears no pants, judst reticulated garbage cans!

            Like old Horatius at the Bridge, like the Legions of Valerian
            (O dearie me: those LOVELY knees!)
            and those reticulated garbage cans!

                         C. McCray Bethancourt

         (sung to the tune (obviously) of the 12 Days of Christmas)


1.           The first time I sent my device, The Heralds said to me

            ""It violates the Rule of Three""

2.           The next time I tried it, the Heralds said to me

            ""We changed the forms, and it violates the Rule of
             Three"".

3.           The third time I tried, and the Heralds said to me, 

            ""We upped the fees, we changed the forms, and it
             violates the Rule of Three"".

4.           Another time I tried and the Heralds said to me,
 
            ""We haven't got it, we upped the fees, we changed the 
             forms, and it violates the Rule of Three"".

5.           The fifth time I tried it, the Heralds said to me,  

            ""In a decision rendered by the College of Arms on
             August 1st, A.S. V it was decided that this style of
             heraldic design was not appropriate to the aims and 
             intentions of the Corporate Body. Holy! Holy! Holy! ""

 note: verse 5 is delivered in an extremely fast, mono-
       tone, similiar to a Gregorian Chant.

           "" ....we haven't got it, we upped the fees, we changed the forms,
             and it violates the Rule of Three.""

6.           I tried it a sixth time, and the Heralds said to me,

            ""We changed the rules, &c""

7.           A seventh time I tried and, the Heralds said to me,

            ""It's against the Rule of Tincture, we changed the
             rules, &c""

8.           I tried it once again and the heralds said to me,

            ""It's not a Period design, It's against the Rule of Tincture, We
             changed the rules, &c""

                                * more *



    Heralds Said To Me (cont.)

9.           I sent it in once more, and the Heralds said to me,

            ""We changed the rules again, It's not a Period design,
             it's against the Rule of Tincture, we changed the
             rules, &c""

10. (sung in cold anger)
             The LAST time I sent my device, the Heralds said to me

    (sung in a state of SMUG)
             ""Someone else has got it, &c""




              (nb: every single one of these reasons has been used by the
              CoA, at one point or another, to reject perfectly good
              heraldry, along with some even MORE stupid.  If the shoe 
              fits....................!!!!!!!!)

           or: Who was that Vermin I saw you with last, Knight?
   or: There may be Lice on all you Knice, but there ain't no Lice on me

           Once there was a Barony howling in the wilderness
           nestled in the Valley where the River doesn't flow
           and the folks were driven buggy by the insects in the Revel Hall
           Authenticity is wonderful, but this doesn't go!

                   Bugs on the Baroness, bugs on the Baroness!
                   That was the cry that you heard all the day
                   and the scratching can be heard from Ysgithr to Ered Sul
                   why did we come here? Let's go away!

           See them all a scratching, nestled in their armour tight
           the fleas have a melee team that's challenging the field!
           call Truly Nolen! Someone's gotta help us out!
           the crabs are nesting in our helms but we'll never yield!

                   (chorus)

           Dawn comes a-breaking, the bugs have won the Coronet...
           flea-infested Conan-clones in piles upon the lawn
           where is the Barony? The bugs have eaten everyone...
           termites got the stick-jocks, and all their sticks are gone!

                          tune: The West's Awake

                  For all the Lands where I have dwelt
                  Oh Atenveldt, Oh Atenveldt
                  till rivers burn and mountains melt
                  lest I forget my Atenveldt
                  From deserts stark to snow-capped peaks
                  from silent lakes and laughing creeks
                  sing: Oh let man find his heart's ease
                  on rocky plains
                  in desert breeze

                  For oft I thought of mighty men
                  who carved a Land with sword and pen
                  and lit a candle, burning bright,
                  that pierced the darkness; stirred the night!
                  tho some are gone their deeds remain
                  this sunny Crown without a stain
                  sing: Oh, their deeds were not in vain!
                  in sunlit days
                  and falling rain.....

                  So raise your banners, blazoned bright
                  Advance the Dream and Shine the Light!
                  in battle's crash and Revel's song
                  raise high the Flag and wave it long!
                  For all the Lands wherein I've dwelt
                  I love you best, my Atenveldt!
                  Sing: Oh the Joy that I have felt!
                  My Atenveldt
                  My Atenveldt

      What the use of wearing panties
      whalebone corsets of your Auntie's
      boxer shorts and other scanties
      best of all is nude
      there's such fun in going bra-less
      now that it's no longer lawless
      'specially if your figure's flawless
      best of all is nude
      nude is what you're born in
      shirts are never torn in
      underwear and lacy flimsies, garter belts and other whimsies
      yards of itchy cloth to put your form in
      ducks all do it, maidens rue it
      even ancient Picts in Britain blue it
      going naked's how to do it
      best of all is nude!

      If your garters aren't elastic
      tie them up in knots fantastic
      (panty hose is something drastic!)
      best of all is nude!
      If you're tired of wearing clotheses
      shed your garment 'mongst the roses
      never mind the old bluenoses
      best of all is nude!
      Nude is best for ducking!
      Worst for horses bucking!
      Moonlit nights will see such sights
          that are very best for fooling round
                              .....and elbows!
      Nudity is grand to see
       a well-known antidote to virginity
      take your clothes off and you'll see:
      best of all is nude!

                   the Legion with it's Eagles bright

                   met them there upon the sand

                   eight-legged steed and hound of Hel

               and made us a Kingdom in their own good time

               Now, Atenveldt forgets the Past
               and thinks on a Day that's coming fast
               when we shall all be....civilized....(puke)
               neat, and clean.....and WELL-ADVISED
               oh won't the Directors be....suprised?!

        Away out here they have a name for even the Ump that's Wuggly

                M'Lady, M'Lady, they call the pigs M'Lady!

        Before I knew M'Lady's name and heard her constant whinin'
        I thought all girls were beautiful and the sun was always shinin'

        Then one day, M'Lady came, and stopped the clocks from tickin'
        she curdled milk, aborted cows, and stopped my stamps from stickin'!

                (chorus)

        Away out here they have a name for everything worth seein'
        but if M'Lady looks at you, then soon you will be fleein'

        M'Lady disappeared one day, and that for sure is scary
        she was the result of experiments by a deranged Vetinary!

                    WEAPONS AT THE DOOR

 Being a Polemic concerning the alleged Custom of the West Kingdom concerning 
 checking your Weapons at the Door of the Revel Hall. As the Satire is the 
 Weapon of the Bard, this said Polemic is to be checked at the Door, along with 
 swords, knives, redheaded Ladies and other such Deadly Things.....

         As I roved out to Western Lands to take the Western Air
         I went into a Revel Hall and I saw a Twelfth Night there
         but I was halted at the gate by a Privy Consellor
                 (that's the man who tells the King of the West how to go to
                  the bath room!)
         who told me I would have to check my Weapons at the door

         As I, in my astonishment, stood hung on tenter-pegs
         a Knight came in whose Prouess hung down between his legs
         the Doorman grabbed a greatsword and he struck the Knight full sore
         and gave him a reciept; he left his weapon at the door!

         a Bard was next whose goodly Voice has entertained us all
         but he, too, was prevented from entering the Hall
         and told he could not carry deadly weapons on the floor
         he left his Voice and Harp among the weapons at the door

         a Master entered graciously, a man we all know well
         who holds a 3rd Dan Black Belt, tho this he'd never tell
         the Master struggled valiantly, the Master cursed and swore
         but he left his hands, and feet, as weapons at the door

         the company was jovial, altho a bit dismayed
         for lack of proper cutlery, down to the smallest blade
         for even teeth and fingernails, each can be used in War
         were cut, and pulled, and left behind, as weapons at the door!

         And has their King not loyal Knights that He must be afraid
         of brawling in his Hall and of Assassin's bloody blade?
         the Rights of Men to carry Arms at least WE'VE not foreswore
         and a POX on them that made the Rule of Weapons at the Door!

                           THE STREETS OF ANN ARBOR

               As I walked out thru the streets of Ann Arbor
               as I walked out thru Ann Arbor one day
               I spied a young Mongol all dressed in white linen
               all dressed in white linen and cold as the clay

               I then spied another, done in on the sidewalk
               along with just about six dozen more
               their wounds were all gaping, from mace and from braoadsword
               from claymore and cannon, all dripping with gore

               what caused this grave carnage, I cried to the Monglos
               oh pray what's the reason for this awful sight
               my answer came slowly from under the corpse-pile
               ""It seems that our bark is much worse than our bite.....""

               the answer continued from pale lips a-shaking
               we sang all our songs and believed them as true
               the Dark Horde could never be beaten in battle
               we thought this was what all good Mongols could do...

               we went down to Atenveldt all for to plunder
               ""too large to defend"" was our song every night
               but Atenveldt's different from East, West or Middle
               there, even the bushes have learned how to bite!

               the Clann stole our ponies, the Scraelings our foodstuffs
               we ran into axes in AtenViking hands
               our maidens ran off with one Richard of Arkham
               and we're all that's left to return to our lands

               MacChluarains and Monsters, Lockehaven and Foxmoor
               that Kingdom is BIG and its' fighters are MEAN!
               we fought and we lost, and fled back to Ann Arbor
               we all came back home with results that you've seen

               keep away from that Land with its' cactus and marshes
               it's no place for Mongols who are bent on War
               they count their blows well, but they strick them yet better
               he crawled into his Yurt, and fell, dead, on the floor.....

       tune: the song of the Cowardly Lion, Tin Woodsman and Scarecrow
             in the movie version of the Wizard of Oz

        (Enter the Scarecrow, who singeth:)

        My wife is always nagging; my Prowess it is lagging
        I can't do anything
        she has got a reason, but revenge is out of season
        Oh I wish I could be King!

        If I just had the Crown on, I'd always have a frown on
        and the Barons on a string
        Heads they would be rolling, the Board would be cajoling
        Oh if only I was King!

        I am very fed up with the way this group is set up
        Oh I'd change everything!
        they are so high and mighty with the way that they do fight-ey
        Oh, someday I'll be King!

        Tho my wife is melancholic, and very...vitriolic
        she's a wasp without a sting!
        I'd have to supervise her with a pack of tranquilizers
        If I only was a King......

        (the Tin Woodsman joineth him, and singeth:)

        I grew up kind of cocky, and rather big, and stocky
        and straight as any rod
        on the field I'm a battallion, with the Ladies I'm a stallion
        ...Oh they'd better make me God!

        The other boys are jealous they say I'm over-zealous
        they'd do better to applaud
        the things that I am giving to this Dream that we are living
        oh I wish they'd make me God!

        They say that I'm conceited, but I'm just badly treated
        by people and by BoD
        just think of what they're missing by My Majesty dismissing
        Oh they'd better make me God!

        (the Cowardly Lion creepeth forth, and singeth:)

        Oh I could be a fighter, a great and mighty smiter
        and be the perfect knight
        it's a great and nasty shame, and everyone's to blame
        oh I wish that I could fight!

        Song of the Three (cont.)

        I could be a Cavalier drinking wine and ale and beer
        and be a gorgeous sight
        but it would cost me too much money so it isn't very funny
        oh I wish that I could fight!                               

        Let me at 'em on the field, I would surely make them yield
        to my Power and my Might
        with rattan, shinai and rapier they would nevermore escape here
        If they'd only let me fight

                She was afraid to come out to the Tourney
                She was worried that ""something might show..""
                She was afraid to come out to the Tourney
                And the poor thing did NOT want to go...

                The Mongols invaded the Middle
                But the Middle did not want to play...

                  (eins - zwei - drei, but the Dark Horde wouldn't die!)

          I'd rather sing a song than work (if it's not too phrasey!)
          Lengthy rhymes don't bother me....truth to tell: I'm lazy!

          Yang, your yurt is very nice, and your Horde is smelly,
          And I'm sure that yak-meat will nicely fill one's belly!
          But remember this one line, or you're not worth jelly:
          FIRST you plunder, THEN you burn! That's how to be rakehelly!

          My Lady Lorelei your eyes do drive me to distraction

          And the Ladies, bless 'em all, are most ornamental!
          But that little Nikki-Toad....has me sentimental

          This stupid little song, m'lords, is mostly sung in Latin
          By the Goliards, of course, from vespers clear to matins!
          But I prefer a coarser cloth over silk or satins
          English is more understood, mine enemies to flatten!

          Good People all, I've made my Song, its' music's well-recited
          But my voice could use some work; the flowers it has blighted!
          It's rude and rusty, grim and bad, and squeaky like a door-hinge,
          But I'm a better Bard than you: I found a rhyme for ""orange!""

                      by William Poundstone
                              1983

     Two mentalities are at work here: 1960s rock fans and 1980s
fundamentalist Christians. The idea of phonographically concealed
messages dates from the Paul McCartney death scare of 1969. For
hard-core types, the secret-message rumors never really died. Avid
rock fans have auditioned ever album release since the late 1960s
for hidden nuances. Backward messages, barely audible messages,
and messages on one stereo track only have been alleged. At the
other end of the sociosensual spectrum, fundamentalist Christians
have gotten into the act. TV programs such as PRAISE THE LORD and
THE 700 CLUB have propagated rumors of a satanic plot in the
recording industry, no less, in which various albums conceal
""backward-masked"" demonic murmurings. If THAT sounds too spacey to
be taken seriously, consider that it was the fundamentalist groups
who were behind House Resolution 6363, a bill introduced in the
U.S. House of Representatives by Robert K. Dornan (R., Calif.) in
1982 to label all suspect records: ""WARNING: THIS RECORD CONTAINS
BACKWARD MASKING THAT MAKES A VERBAL STATEMENT WHICH IS AUDIBLE
WHEN THIS RECORD IS PLAYED BACKWARD AND WHICH MAY BE PERCEPTIBLE
AT A SUBLIMINAL LEVEL WHEN THIS RECORD IS PLAYED FORWARD."" In
February 1983, the Arkansas State Senate passed a similar record-
labeling bill by a vote of 86 to 0.
     Contributing to the quasi-occult status of these rumors is
the difficulty of checking them out on home audio equipment. You
pretty much have to take someone else's word for it, or dismiss
the rumors out of hand.
     From a technical standpoint, there are four simple ways to
conceal a verbal message on a recording. The most obvious is to
record the message at a very low volume. The message may then be
recovered by turning the volume up while playing the record or
tape. If the message is faint enough, though, noise levels of home
equipment may garble it. If the accompanying music or lyrics are
loud enough, or if the message itself is indistinct or
electronically modified, it may be hard to hear on any equipment.
     A second gimmick is to record a message on one stereo track
only. Records and tapes have two independent recordings, of
course, normally played simultaneously for stereo effect. On a
record, each stereo track occupies on one side of the V-shaped
groove for the needle. On a tape, the tracks are recorded in
parallel lanes of the magnetic material. The two tracks are called
""right"" and ""left"" after the stereo speakers they will play on.
Otherwise, the tracks are interchangeable -- the sound mixer can
put anything he or she wants on each track. A message on one track
can be masked by simultaneous loud music or lyrics on the opposite
track. With normal stereo balance (or mono equipment) the loud
track drowns out the message track. At home, single-track messages
can be recovered by adjusting the stereo balance so that only the
desired track plays. Sometimes this trick also makes indistinct
words clearer. Even if the words are not exclusively on one track,
they may happen to be more audible on one track.
     A message could be recorded at a speed different from the
rest of the record. Then the record would have to be played faster
or slower than usual to recover the message. Unless the message
was at one of the standard speeds (say, 45 rpm on a 33 1/3 rpm
record), it could not be played normally on home equipment.
     The fourth and most commonly alleged trick is to record a
verbal message backward. Reversed speech has several unexpected
features. One is that syllables are not a constant in the reversal
process. A one-syllable word can have two or three syllables when
played backward. Thus ""number nine"" in the Beatles' REVOLUTION 9
reverses to ""Turn me on, dead man"" (or something like it), a jump
from three to five syllables.
     There is no simple way to predict what a word or phrase will
sound like reversed. Obviously, you can't just reverse the
letters.
     Reversed messages are difficult to recover at home. Record
turntables are not built to go backwards. Some have a neutral
setting, in which the pickup and amplifier remain active and you
can turn the record backward by hand. But hardly anyone has a
stead enough hand to produce satisfactory results.
     With patience, it is possible to reverse a cassette
recording. Transfer the music from the original record or tape
onto a blank tape cassette. Place the cassette flat on a table.
Draw our the part of the tape with the suspected message and snip
it off at both ends. Hold the tape segment horizontally. Rotate it
180 degrees, keep it horizontal at all times. This turns the tape
end for end. Splice the reversed tape segment back onto the two
loose ends of the cassette with strong adhesive tape. Reel the
tape back inside the cassette. The sliced segment will play
backward on an ordinary cassette player.
     I rented a recording studio to test the secret-message
rumors. New copiies of the records in question were transcribed on
a quarter-inch master tape. Where rumor alleged that a single
stereo track contained a message, right and left stereo tracks
were transcribed separately. Records with alleged inaudible
messages were treated similarly. To test claims of reversed
messages, recordings on the master tape were edited out and
spliced in backward. Twenty cuts or portions of cuts from sixteen
albums were tested.


""Another One Bites the Dust""
Queen, THE GAME

Rumor: When played backward, the lyrics say, ""It's fun to smoke
marijuana.""
Findings: There is something that sounds like ""It's fun to smoke
marijuana"" in the reversed music. It is repeated over and over. It
might be rendered no less faithfully, however, as ""sfun to scout
mare wanna."" This ""message"" is the reversal of the song title,
which is repeated as a line in the song.
     Let's make a distinction between engineered and phonetic
reversals. When an artist records a verbal statement, reverses it
by turning the tape end for end, mixes the reversed statement onto
a master tape, and has records and tapes produced from the master,
that is an engineered reversal. When the phonetic properties of
song lyrics are such that they can be reversed to sound like
something else, that is a phonetic reversal.
     ""It's fun to smoke marijuna"" is clearly a phonetic reversal.
The lyrics are perfectly plain played forward (""Another one bites
the dust""), no so plain played backward (""sfun to scout mare
wanna""). With an engineered reversal, the opposite should hold
true: gibberish forward, clear as a bell backward. Some are
prepared to believe that phonetic reversals are just as
intentional as engineered reversals -- that the songwriter
painstakinginly planned the phonetic double-entendre. In the
absence of confirming evidence, that just doesn't wash. It's too
easy to find coincidences. If, for example, the letters of the
alphabet are recited in conventional fashion (Ay, Bee, Cee, etc.)
and reversed, at least five sound like English language words. D
reverses to ""eden,"" F becomes ""pray,"" S becomes ""say,"" V becomes
""even,"" and Z becomes ""easy."" ""It's fun to smoke marijuana"" is
likewise a coincidence.


""A Child is Coming""
Jefferson Starship, BLOWS AGAINST THE EMPIRE

Rumor: When played backward, ""son of Satan.""
Findings: Another phonetic coincidence. The repeated ""It's getting
better"" reverses to an iffy ""son of Satan,"" the ""of"" drawn out and
the ""Satan"" strongly accented on the first syllable.


""Eldorado""
Electric Light Orchestra, ELDORADO

Rumor: When played backward, ""He is the nasty one/ Christ, you're
infernal/ It is said we're dead men/ Everyone who has the mark
will live.""
Findings: Coincidence. The supposed message lurks around the line
""On a voyage of no return to see."" Reversed, this passage becomes
the expected syllable salad -- no one hearing it would describe it
as anything but reversed music. Only if you listen while reading
along with what you're supposed to hear will you get anything. The
rumored version of the message is somewhat fudged. The passage
sounds more like ""He's to nasty one/ Christ you are, Christ,
you're fernal/ There wiss uh, we're dead men..."" There is no ""in""
in what is taken to be ""infernal."" The line that is supposed to be
""Everyone who has the mark will live"" isn't even close, though the
syllable count is right.


""Shoo Be Doo""
The Cars, CANDY-O

Rumor: When played backward, the word ""Satan"" repeated
approximately eleven times.
Findings: Coincidence. The rumor refers to the reversal of the ""Shoo
be doo, shoo be doo, shoo be doo..."" near the end of the song. Given
the mysterious logic of reversed phonemes, these three-syllable units
can be hard as a repeated two-syllable word. The word sounds a little
like ""Satan.""


""Snowblind""
Styx, PARADISE THEATER

Rumor: According to a mimeographed list of suspect records distributed
by Congressman Dornan, the words ""Satan move through our voices"" when
played backwards.
Findings: Negative. Despite repeated listenings, it was not even
possible to identify the part of the reversed track that Dornan et al.
are talking about.


""Stairway to Heaven""
Led Zeppelin, untitled, a.k.a. STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN

Rumor: In reverse, ""I live for Satan... The Lord turns me off...
There's no escaping it... Here's to my sweet Satan... There's power in
Satan... He will give you 666.""
Findings: Coincidence. If you listen very carefully to the ""And it
makes me wonder"" lines in reverse, you'll hear something approaching
""There's no escaping it."" A better description is ""There's no escape
do."" Knock of the last syllable, and you have ""There's no escape,"" a
complete, intelligible sentence in reverse. It's there, all right, but
it's not an unlikely enough coincidence to -- well, make you wonder.
      The ""Satan"" in ""I live for Satan"" is good and clear. The ""I live
for"" part isn't. The other alleged lines are unremarkable. All are
phonetic reversals of the entirely lucid forward lyrics and obviously
just accidents.


""When Electricity Came to Arkansas""
Black Oak Arkansas, BLACK OAK ARKANSAS and RONCH AND ROLL

Rumor: In reverse, ""Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan. He is God. He
is God.""
Findings: The BLACK OAK ARKANSAS cut was reversed. Again, pairs of
reversed syllables are being freely interpreted as ""Satan."" ""He is
God"" was not identifiable.


""Rain""
The Beatles, HEY JUDE

Rumor: Unintelligible lyrics at the end are reversed.
Findings: A true engineered reversal and not really a secret. ""Rain""
seems to have been the first popular recording to incorporate an
obviously reversed lyric. The story is that John Lennon accidentally
spliced the last part of the song in backward and liked the effect.
When reversed, the strange-sounding vocals at the end become
intelligible as a reprise starting with the drawn-out word
""sunshine.""
      The reversal is less apparent to the casual listener than it
might be because the accompanying music is not reversed. The ending
fits in smoothly with the rest of the song, the vocals suggesting a
foreign language.


""Fire on High""
Electric Light Orchestra, FACE THE MUSIC

Rumor: When played backward, ""The music is reversible, but time --
turn back!""
Findings: ""Fire on High"" is instrumental. About twenty-six seconds
into the music, scrambled speech is heard. It is mostly louder than
the accompanying music and begins with a two-syllable unit repeated
several times. The seeming speech lasts for about fourteen seconds.
      Reversing the music confirms that there is a true, engineered
message. In reverse, a voice (Jeff Lynne's?) says, ""The music is
reversible, but time -- turn back! Turn back! Turn back! Turn back!""
All the words are clear and unambiguous. Anyone comparing this to the
alleged reversal on ELO's ""Eldorado"" will have no trouble telling
which is genuine.


""Goodbye Blue Sky""
Pink Floyd, THE WALL

Rumor: In reverse, ""You have discovered the secret message.""
Findings: The ""secret message"" is at the very end of the instrumental
passage following the ""Goodbye Blue Sky"" vocals. It comes just before
the words ""What shall we do"" at the start of the song that is
identified as ""Empty Spaces"" on the record label and as ""What shall we
do now?"" on the record sleeve. Played forward, the message is less
apparent than the FACE THE MUSIC reversal: A reasonably attentive
listener might play THE WALL through and not catch it. It suggests
speech not quite close enough to be overheard. In context this is not
unusual because the ""Goodbye Blue Sky"" instrumental passage includes
""airport noises"" and other sound effects. A loud climax in the music
further masks the unintelligible voice.
      When played backward, the voice (Roger Waters?) plainly intones,
""Congratulations, you have just discovered the secret message. Please
send your answer to old Pink, care of the funny farm..."" As the voice
fades out, there may be another word -- perhaps ""Chalfonte or
""Chelsea"" -- after ""funny farm.""


""Heavy Metal Poisoning""
Styx, KILROY WAS HERE

Rumor: A red sticker on the KILROY WAS HERE cover warns, ""By order of
the Majority for Musical Morality, this album contains secret backward
messages...""
Findings: This is a case of second-generation backward-masking. Styx'
PARADISE THEATER did not contain a backward message, though a lot of
people said it did. So Styx has included a sure enough backward
message on KILROY WAS HERE. It is at the very beginning of ""Heavy
Metal Poisoning."" The reversed speech last about three seconds. There
is no musical background. The words reverse to ""Annuit coeptis. Novus
ordo seclorum."" This is the Latin motto encircling the pyramid on the
back of a dollar bill. The usual translation: ""God has favored our
undertakings. A new order of the ages.""
      The cover sticker's ""Majority for Musical Morality"" is a
fictitious Falwellesque group in the KILROY WAS HERE video. Although
the sticker suggests a plurality of ""messages,"" only one was found.


Space between ""I'm So Tired"" and ""Blackbird""
The Beatles, untitled, a.k.a. THE WHITE ALBUM

Rumor: A reversed message. At the time of the Paul-is-dead stories,
the segue from ""I'm So Tired"" to ""Blackbird"" was offered as evidence.
It was held to contain John Lennon's voice, reveresed, saying ""Paul is
dead, miss him, miss him, miss him."" That interpretation seems
unlikely now, but there is a mysterious low muttering between the
songs.
Findings: The mumbling is actually just to the ""I'm So Tired"" side of
the shiny ""space"" between cuts on the record. Each of the stereo
tracks was recorded separately, twice, and a copy of each track was
reversed. This produced four versions of the two-second passage: right
forward, left forward, right reversed, and left reversed. All were
equally unintelligible. It was not even apparent whether the voice is
forward or reversed. Nor could John Lennon be identified as the
speaker. There are nine or ten syllables. The first six (when played
forward) are a two-syllable unit repeated three times. There is little
or no difference betwen the stereo tracks. Any claimed interpretation
of the sounds seems doubtful.


""Strawberry Fields Forever""
The Beatles, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR

Rumor: It was, of course, claimed that John Lennon says ""I buried
Paul"" at the end. (It's forward, at the very end after the music
fades to complete silence, returns, and starts to fade out again.)
But Lennon told ROLLING STONE that the words are ""cranberry
sauce.""
Findings: They are ""cranberry sauce."" The ""sauce""/""Paul"" part is
indistinct, but the first syllable sounds a lot more like ""cran""
than ""I.""


""Baby You're a Rich Man""
The Beatles, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR

Rumor: On one of the tracks the line ""Baby you're a rich man too""
is sung as ""Baby you're a rich fag Jew,"" a dig at Brian Epstein.
Or some think it's ""rich fat Jew"" and claim it as evidence of
Beatle anti-Semitism.
Findings: Negative. The two stereo tracks are nearly identical.
It's always possible to hear words as similar-sounding words, but
basically, the lyrics jibe with the published version.


""Revolution 9""
The Beatles, untitled, a.k.a. THE WHITE ALBUM

Rumor: Various reversed and/or one-track speech. The reversal of
""Number nine"" to ""Turn me on, dead man"" has pretty much been
discounted as coincidence (though it appears on Congressman
Dornan's list).
Findings: Distinction between lyrics and any hidden message blurs
on ""Revolution 9."" The eight-minute cut is a montage of sounds
collected by John Lennon and Yoko Ono. It includes discordant
music, radio broadcasts, sirens, applause, gunfights, sports
cheers, the crackling of a fire, screams, a baby gurgling, a choir
singing, and much that cannot be identified. For this
investigation, ""Revolution 9"" was transcribed four times, twice on
each stereo channel. One copy of each of the tracks was reversed.
The four resulting versions were compared with each other and
against the original two-channel version.
     ""Revolution 9"" contains a lot of talking. Played in stereo,
forward, the longest stretch of understandable speech is probably
an announcer saying, ""...every one of them knew that as time went
by they'd get a little bit older and a little bit slower...""
     One believable instance of reversed speech occurs: someone
saying ""Let me out! Let me out!"" (once held to represent McCartney
in his totaled Aston-Martin). Two iffy reversals occur on the
backward recording of the right stereo track:""She used to be
assistant"" and ""There were two men..."" Neither is clear enough or
long enough to be convincing. Some of the music, including the
recurring theme, sounds more natural in reverse.
     ""Turn me on, dead man"" is a typical phonetic reversal. The
forward ""number nine"" (repeated throughout the cut) is clear; the
reversal is slurred -- something like ""turn me on dedmun."" It has
been claimed that ""number nine"" must be pronounced with a British
accent or with some careful inflection in order to reverse to
""Turn me on, dead man."" This seems not to be so. As an experiment,
three American-accent renderings of ""number nine"" were reversed.
All sound about as much like ""Turn me on, dead man"" as the record
did. Like the other phonetic reversals, ""Turn me on, dead man""
must be considered a coincidence.
     Much of ""Revolution 9"" is on one stereo track only. Near the
end a voice says ""A fine natural imbalance...the Watusi...the
twist...Eldorado...Eldorado."" ""A fine natural imbalance"" is on the
right track only, though the words that follow are in stereo. One
of the longer bits of speech -- ""Who could tell what he was
saying? His voice was low and his [unintelligible] was high and
his eyes were low"" -- is clear on the left track, a bare whisper
on the right.
     There is a stereophonically concealed ""secret message"" on
""Revolution 9."" The words are on the right track. They begin about
four minutes, fifty-eight seconds into the cut and run for about
twenty-two seconds. They are not likely to be noticed in stereo
because of the much louder left track. The sound of applause
begins on the left track at about five minutes, one second into
the cut. Deafening noises -- the clapping, sirens, music --
continue on the left track until five minutes, forty seconds. It
may or may not have been Lennon's and Ono's intention to conceal
the spoken passage. Given the haphazard quality of ""Revolution 9,""
the concealment may have been accidental. To recover the passage,
the left track must be switched off. The right track can then be
heard to contain a sound like a stopwatch ticking, behind these
words:

     So the wife called, and we better go to see a
     surgeon....[A SCREAM MUFFLES A LINE THAT SOUNDS LIKE
     Well, what with the prices, the prices have snowballed,
     no wonder it's closed.] ...So any and all, we went to
     see the dentist instead, who gave him a pair of teeth,
     which wasn't any good at all. So instead of that he
     joined the bloody navy and went to sea.
                      by William Poundstone
                              1986

     There really are backward messages on rock albums. And the
controversy over ""backward masking"" and ""porn rock"" has inspired a
whole new spate of messages. There may have been more genuine
backward messages in the past few years than ever before.
     The backward message controversy is usually traced to the
1960s and John Lennon's avant-garde sound mixing on such tracks as
""Revolution 9"" on the Beatles' WHITE ALBUM. Lennon probably wasn't
trying to conceal a message so much as create an interesting
sound.
     The matter might have ended right there had it not been for
the Paul McCartney death rumor. College kids tried playing Beatles
records forward, backward, and at various speeds to find ""clues""
to McCartney's fate. In the process they found snippets of speech
from Lennon's experiments. Even after McCartney was found safe and
sound in Scotland, some listeners continued to look for hidden
messages.
     Somehow, fundamentalist Christian groups became convinced
(ca. 1982) that the alleged messages were commercials for devil
worship. Not a single indisputable satanic message has turned up,
but there were scattered attempts to ban or label certain albums.
In 1986 one fundamentalist group announced that the theme song for
the old MR. ED TV show contains the word ""Satan"" when played
backward.)
     Ironically, the publicity accorded nonexistent messages has
inspired several artists -- among them porn rock hearing witness
Frank Zappa -- to hide real background messages in their music.
It's easy to do.
     The performer speaks or sings the message normally, then
reverses the tape, which is mixed into the soundtrack. This is all
accomplished simply enough at any recording studio.
     What's not so simple is playing it back. More home record,
cassette, and compact disk players won't play backward. You can
turn a record backward with a pencil eraser, but it's not good for
the needle or the turntable. The only way to reproduce the message
with full fidelity is to use a professional-quality reel-to-reel
tape player and splice the tape in backward.
     We used the facilities of KLOS radio in Los Angeles to
reverse some recent records containing true backward messages.


""Secret Messages""
Electric Light Orchestra, SECRET MESSAGES

ELO's ELDORADO album was among those alleged to contain satanic
backward masked messages. A patient listening to ELDORADO played
backward reveals no such messages. You hear only what you ought to
hear -- the reversed lyrics of the songs, which sound nothing like
the ""messages"" claimed to be there. In the wake of such
allegations, ELO did put an (innocuous) backward message on their
FACE THE MUSIC album. Perhaps they thought this would show how
silly the allegations were. Instead, the backward-masking people
seized on this as proof that the other ""messages"" were real. In
the latest volley, ELO has named an album after the controversy.
     In Britain (where the backward-masking issue is viewed as an
American eccentricity), the cover of SECRET MESSAGES has a mock
warning label to youth about the hidden label. Word of the albums'
impending release in the United States caused enough of a furor to
chill CBS Records into deleting the cover blurb.
     The reversed message is easy to find. It's at the beginning
of the first song, which is itself called ""Secret Messages."" You
can hear reversed speech when you play the record normally. A
voice intones ""secret messages"" -- forward -- in the middle of the
reversed speech, lest anyone dare be so unhip as to not know
what's going on.
     We transferred a new copy of SECRET MESSAGES to reel-to-reel
tapes and played it backward. The backward message goes: ""WELCOME
TO THE BIG SHOW/ WELCOME TO THE BIG SHOW.""
     That's it.


""Ya Hozna""
Frank Zappa, THEM OR US

""Ya Hozna,"" a six-minute composition on the first record of the
THEM OR US double album, is ENTIRELY backward. The albums' inner
cover, which includes lyrics for the other songs, says, ""backwards
vocal -- you figure it out"" of this cut. It credits Frank and Moon
Zappa, George Duke, and Napoleon Murphy Brock as vocalists.
     Played forward, ""Ya Howza"" sounds like a record played
backward -- reasonably so. The vocals are prominent and
unintelligible. Moon Zappa's voice is curiously recognizable, even
in reverse. It is hard to tell whether the music was recorded
forward or backward.
     When ""Ya Howza"" is played in reverse, you discover that the
music is virtually a palindrome -- it sounds about the same
forward and backward. The voices are all backward. In some cases
they have been modified electronically. Many of the words are
muffled. Even after repeated careful listening on both stereo
tracks, it is difficult to make out many of the lyrics. It doesn't
help that some of the words seem to be stream-of-consciousness
nonsense. Some of the unintelligible stuff sounds like opera.
     Starting at the beginning of the reversed tape -- the end of
the forward tape -- the clearer vocals go like this: ""I am the
heaven, I am the water."" This is in a hymnlike register. ""You are
a lonely little girl./ But your mommy and your daddy hold you."" A
singsong synthesizer voice.
     The most interesting part of the lyrics is an intermittently
orgasmic rap in Moon Zappa's Valley Girl voice. There are three
short monologues:

I'm like green!
I'm like squat!
I'm like soul!
Repeat, like soul!
I'm like pull, push,
Okay, like slow, slow.

You're never too old
Like slow, like slow, like slow
Okay, I like it.


All right, faster, faster,
Go, do it, do it twice,
Yeah, that feels good,
I'm looking great,
Yeah, fer shure!
Like, no way!


""No Anchovies, Please""
J. Geils Band, LOVE STINKS

""No Anchovies, Please"" is a novelty song, really a narration with
sound effects, about a woman who is kidnapped after eating
anchovies. She is taken to a ""foreign-speaking"" country. The sound
effect of the foreign tongue seems reversed. When you do play it
in reverse, it becomes: ""It doesn't take a genius to know the
difference between chicken shit and chicken salad.""


""Darling Nikki""
Prince, PURPLE RAIN

""Darling Nikki,"" cited as porn rock before Congress, is about a
dominatrix in a hotel lobby masturbating with a magazine. In part,
the complaint was that the album cover (flowers, and Prince on a
motorcycle) wasn't explicit enough to warn kids of the suggestive
lyrics. Senator Paula Hawkins apparently was not aware of a
backward message hidden in ""Darling Nikki."" The last thirty-five
seconds of the song is gibberish. The music changes abruptly and
becomes a repeated glottal sound. Then a two-syllable sound is
repeated twice, something like ""heaven, heaven."" Unintelligible
speech follows. At the end is a sound reminiscent of rain or bacon
frying , and wind sounds.
     Played backward, the message becomes:

     Hello, how are you?
     I'm fine 'cause I know that the Lord is coming soon.
     Coming, coming soon.

     It is clearly Prince and the Revolution singing this. The
words are clear but the intonation is funny -- the linger on some
words. Perhaps this is to make the reversed message you hear
playing the record normally a little less conspicuous.
     This is a weird reversal of the supposed secret message
menace. Raunchy forward lyrics conceal a religious secret message.


""Judas Kiss""
Petra, MORE POWER TO YOU

Petra is an obscure group that sings religious songs to a rock
beat. As further proof that things have gone full circle, the
backward-masking controversy prompted Petra to include a wholesome
backward message on their MORE POWER TO YOU album. It is in the
transition between two songs, just before ""Judas Kiss."" Clearly
audible gibberish reverses to this (the husky voice a cross
between George Beverly Shea and Dee Snider): ""What are you looking
for the Devil for, when you ought to be looking for the Lord?""

AFL JoyceM Welcome to the Apple II Music & Sound chat - our discussion will
           be on NoiseTracker - the new FTA music program for the GS.  AFA
           Gene will be our host this evening...Gene, the floor is yours :)

AFA Gene   Hi all... well first I'd like to point out, if y'all aren't aware
           yet, that a spanking new version of NoiseTracker has recently
           been released (9 days ago) and is now available in our New Files
           library. It is version 0.5. I haven't played around with it much
           yet, but it's supposed to fix a lot of the little bugs in 0.3
           (the first version we had online).  NoiseTracker also includes
           the ability to directly import ""modules,"" a term used for a
           certain type of Amiga song file which has become popular among PC
           users using the SoundBlaster sound card.

           Now, via NT, these ""MOD"" files are accessible by the GS. We
           expect to see a lot of activity on this end as far as ports from
           the PC and Amiga go. Note that you should be able to go straight
           to the PC music forum and download any recently uploaded MOD
           songfiles (there was a bug in the first wide release of the PCAO
           software, however, so a bunch of files with dates between around
           March 1991 and September 1991 may not download properly. Note that
           to use these PC MOD files, you'll have to rename the downloaded
           file ""MOD.xxxxxx"" if you want it to show up automatically in NT's
           ""open"" dialog box. (On the PC, all MOD files are named
           ""xxxxxxxx.MOD"" instead.)   Also, if the files are packed with ZIP
           compression, you'll need a program from the Communications Forum
           called AGATE -- it's a terminal program that includes the ability
           to unpack ZIP files.

           Now, I guess the best thing to do would be to talk about our
           favorite songfiles... there have been a few complaints, in fact,
           that people were not being ""descriptive"" enough in their file
           descriptions for uploads in describing the songs.

AFC Eddie  ?

AFA Gene   GA ed

AFC Eddie  Once a MOD file is unpacked with Agate, is a file type change
           needed?

AFA Gene   Nope, since all that NT looks for is the ""MOD."" being the first
           four characters in the filename.

AFC Eddie  OK, Thanks!

Deanna7332 Question...

JonL7      Can you list some of the features of Noisetracker?

AFA Gene   (you don't even need that ""MOD."" if you want to type the name in
           directly.)

Deanna7332 Did any of these mod files have anything to do with FTA's ""Module
           A""

AFA Gene   Sure Jon, right after we answer Deanna's question. Deanna, you
           mean ""Modulae?""

Deanna7332 Yes, that's it.

AFA Gene   Modulae was a demo written by FTA last year. (i'll get to you in a
           sec Doors).  It used SoundSmith v0.95 for all it's music. There
           is no connection between MOD files and Modulae by FTA.

Deanna7332 Throughout the demo it said ""Loading modules""

AFA Gene   Those ""modules"" are not the same as Amiga soundfile ""modules"" --
           you see, what Modulae really was was a ""stringing together"" of a
           bunch of neat little tiny demos that FTA had written. So they
           called each little demo a ""module"" and thus the entire demo as a
           whole, ""Modulae"" (fancy plural of module?)

Deanna7332 Ok I understand.  Thank you. :)

AFL JoyceM Latin, Gene :)

AFA Gene   The term ""MODule"" from the Amiga comes from the idea that all the
           stuff needed to play the songfile (all the instruments + the
           sequence file) are included into one file, the ""module.""

TheDoors1  Gene, I have tried to d/l some recent uploaded MODs in the PC
           music area and still the problem exists.

AFA Gene   As I understand it, the problem was fixed VERY recently (correct
           me on this Joyce) and files uploaded as recently as early
           November still might not work depending on the version of the
           PCAO software that the uploader used.

AFL JoyceM Actually, Gene...I was under the impression that it had been, but
           if Doors is still having a problem, then it must not be fixed.

AFA Gene   What date was the file you tried to d/l, Door?

TheDoors1  umm 11/17, around there

AFA Gene   hmmm.... well i can tell you one thing... if it didn't work, don't
           waste your time again later... the problem is in the Apple
           software's method of d/lling files, and there are no plans to
           upgrade the Apple AO software.

AFL JoyceM I will endeavor to get an answer to that PC downloading
           problem/question :)

ThomasK63  i have a quick question... what can you use to unpack amiga mod
           files? On the PC side, that is.

TheDoors1  Agate Thomas

ELECTMUSIC Doors... what happens on after downloading..

Deanna7332 If it's LZHed you can't unless you have an IBM or
           PC/Transporter.

AFA Gene   If GS-ShrinkIt doesn't have that ability, i don't think there
           exists any such utility on the GS.

TheDoors1  What do you mean Elect?

ELECTMUSIC After you download the file... where do you encounter a problem?

TheDoors1  ok, you know when you download the file and at some point in the
           download the file starts to appear on your screen.  That's when I
           cancel it.

ThomasK63  I am sure soething good can be made w/out resorting to Amiga
           files

AFC Eddie  Yes, Doors, I believe the problem is with the PC software it was
           UL'd with.

TheDoors1  yeah Eddie.

GNO Tim    Amiga MOD files are typically compressed using LHarc.  I've
           uncompressed several on my Unix machine at school.

ThomasK63  good time for someone to make a lharc unpacker...

AFC DYAJim someone might be ;)

GNO Tim    Several people are already

AFC Eddie  Can't wait, Jim!

AFA Gene   Jon, did you have a question?

JonL7      The features of Noisetracker :)

AFA Gene   Oh yes... okay, here goes, in a nutshell, from most important to
           least:


AFA Gene   *  ability to import MOD files

           *  ability to import Soundsmith files

           *  ProDOS 8 based

           *  virtually no editing abilities (not a feature but important to
           know)

AFC DYAJim :)

AFA Gene   *  forgot: and the most important feature of all, the ability to
           hold instrument files in regular system RAM instead of DOC RAM,
           allowing for instruments far beyond the regular 64K limit found
           in ALL other GS music programs.

ThomasK63  I'll buy that!

TheDoors1  I have another question...when you're ready.

AFA Gene   GA Doors

TheDoors1  ok..is it true that NoiseTracker will take in soundsmith files and
           play them more clearly

AFA Gene   Well, as far as ""what you hear,"" yes there is a definite
           difference with some instruments. It does NOT play the sounds
           more ""clearly,"" but it just plays them in a different way. What
           many people seem to like about this ""different way"" is that
           sustained instruments (i.e. instruments designed to be played
           in a loop to simulate a long held note) seem to work better (or
           perhaps simply the way they were originally intended to work).

TheDoors1  I see

Deanna7332 Which takes up more space - MOD or NT  w/soundfile ?

AFA Gene   Deanna, it depends a few things, such as how big the sequence is,
           how many instruments you have, etc. Once you have a lot of
           assorted files, it'll probably average out to be about the same
           give or take a hundred blocks on your HD. So it basically depends
           on whether you prefer to have your instruments separate or not.

Deanna7332 Does playing quality differ with either one ?

AFA Gene   Nope. It's exactly the same either way. Loading time is the same
           too.

AFC Eddie  Can NT save songs as MOD files?

AFA Gene   Nope. It has options for Open and Close module, but these are
           still inactive.

AFA Gene   If there are no more questions, I'd like to talk about which NT
           files out there are the ""hottest,"" since this info could be
           useful to many users who are interested in downloading NT/MOD
           files.

           My personal favorite is ""Lambada,"" which is supplied by FTA with
           the program but is available separately on America
           Online.Everything about this file is really impressive except
           perhaps the sound quality of the horn-ish melody instrument.

           What about y'all, what are your favorite NT files?

AFL JoyceM Gene, there is a classical song for NT, but can't remember the
           name, but it is good.

AFC Eddie  I like Dragnet!

ELECTMUSIC So do I Ed

TheDoors1  I like Seven something

Deanna7332 My most favorite of all mod files is Pleasure Principle

AFC Eddie  <--appreciate's Greg's taste!

AFL JoyceM :)

AFA Gene   Deanna, i assume you got that from a local board?

Deanna7332 I got it from the PC forum here.

TheDoors1  I saw it there also

Deanna7332 I think under ""Pleasure""

AFA Gene   Would you be able to upload it here? If it's really that good, we
           ought to have it available directly in our oun NT lib here (BTW
           folks, we will be releasing a new NoiseTracker software library
           soon!)

AFC Eddie  What a Forum!!!

Deanna7332 That sounds great!

AFL JoyceM Gene, do you think it will be possible for synthLAB files to be
           converted to MOD files?

AFL JoyceM MOD files?

AFA Gene   I doubt it, Joyce. The formats are so diametrically opposed in
           their entire basis of their file formats that it wouldn't be
           worth the time for a programmer to develop such a convertor.

Deanna7332 Isn't it possible to move the mod file from the PC forum to our
           music library?

AFA Gene   But..... it might be worth the time for a MIDI File Format to MOD
           convertor, since these two formats are more widely accepted.

Nuzz       they have nothing better to do Gene

ELECTMUSIC Gene.. some interesting similarities with DTune and NTracker

AFA Gene   They lose the file, tho, Deanna. :)

AFL JoyceM In what way, Greg?

ELECTMUSIC Both Prodos 8

Deanna7332 Shhh they won't know a thing :)

ELECTMUSIC I also believe Bill uses a shuttling of sound data between Doc
           Ram and Ram.

AFC Eddie  Interesting, Greg.

ELECTMUSIC Thats how he gets some of the excellent instrument quality

AFC Eddie  But Diversitune has that one distinction:  MIDI input.

AFL JoyceM Deanna, we would greatly appreciate it if you would upload that
           'Pleasure' song to our library :)

ELECTMUSIC Agreed Ed.. one of the factors FTA doesn't like to incorporate
           into their programs.

Deanna7332 I'll u/l it tonight if possible.

AFL JoyceM Thanks :)

AFC Eddie  Thanks, Deanna!

AFL JoyceM I will send Bill B a copy of NoiseTracker + some MOD files...to
           see what comments we get from him (will send when I get back).

AFC DYAJim What ever happened to that diversitune upgrade that was talked
           about ?

ELECTMUSIC That would be interesting Joyce

AFC Eddie  Bill apparently still working on it, Jim.

ELECTMUSIC I am sure he would appreciate the Prodos 8

AFC DYAJim good..

AFL JoyceM Jim...RSN....he was hoping by Christmas (this year), but he is
           soooo busy with his job, who knows?

AFC DYAJim Oh yeah, I noticed the speed calcuation in NT .5 is inaccurate
           :)

AFC DYAJim I recall he has set a lot of Christmas projected dates :)

ELECTMUSIC He was one of the first ""Free Tools"" experts in breaking all the
           rules for economic sake.

AFC DYAJim like for the vaporware DT inst editor like 2 years ago.

Deanna7332 Are there any Christmas Mod or NT songs?

AFC Eddie  Oh yeah, Diversi-Editor!

AFL JoyceM I know, Jim - but that I know he has been working on.

AFC DYAJim he projected Christmas for it, and it never came :)

AFA Gene   Not yet in AMS, but hopefully the Holiday Contest will change all
           that. :)

AFC DYAJim I look foreward to any upgrades..

AFL JoyceM Not that I am aware of Deanna - you have some?  hint, hint

Deanna7332 Nope sorry.  I was hoping there were some that could be u/led
           here

AFC DYAJim I'll be breaking out the xmas tune book rsn.. I should be able to
           midi a few :) (which rules out nt)

AFL JoyceM Question...

AFC Eddie  It would be more appropriate to have a converter from Appleworks
           spreadsheet to MOD than from MIDI!

AFL JoyceM If I got ahold of an Amiga song (MOD) disk...how would I convert
           them for here?

AFA Gene   You mean an Amiga-formatted disk?

AFL JoyceM Yes

AFC DYAJim Ack.. methinks you need an amiga and a null modem cable or a
           modem.

AFA Gene   Methinks Jim is right

AFC DYAJim LOL!!  Design your music in the spreadsheet then import to NT :)
           IT might actually have better editing?!! :)

AFC Eddie  Right!

AFL JoyceM Me thinks he is right.  If I had them upload to me, would that
           work?

AFA Gene   Yep; should work like a charm.

AFC DYAJim Yah.. as long as they're coming from an amiga

AFL JoyceM Great....I will work on that when I get back  (making note now).

AFL JoyceM Gene, will you get some of those files (NT) sent to that area
           tonight?  If so, I will leave the needed message :)

AFA Gene   That's all I have planned for tonight's chat, Joyce. Yep, I'll
           move some files right now.

AFL JoyceM Thanks...

AFL JoyceM Then we should have our NoiseTracker Library by end of the week in
           AMS :)

ELECTMUSIC Gene... quick question:  Are you launching NTracker from a 3.5
           disk?

AFL JoyceM Okay, guys...I will see you all the week of December 11th (may the
           4th) as I am off on vacation.

AFA Gene   Yep greg

AFC JohnC  Where are you going?

ELECTMUSIC Do you encounter out of memory problems

AFL JoyceM Night all...and Gene, thanks for an excellent chat and great
           explanations of NoiseTracker.

Nuzz       Joyce, I have good news for FutureSound owners. SoundConvert will
           support it in the first release

AFC Eddie  Great, Mike!

AFA Gene   Greg, i always keep my RAMdisk at 0 when using noisetracker. Not
           only are

AFC JohnC  Mike...SoundConvert...released?

AFL JoyceM Great, Mike.  When can we get SoundConvert, Mike? and FutureSound
           :)

AFA Gene   there a couple of bugs with memory management, but if you're
           loading in a MOD file that's really big, NT will eat your RAMdisk.

AFC Eddie  Sounds good.

Nuzz       The manual is being ""layout"". Release date should be about 1st
           week of Dec

ELECTMUSIC Tnxs Gene

AFC JohnC  YES.......WTG Nuzz!!!!!!!!

Deanna7332 Yes, why is there on some MOD files a stop somewhere in the middle
           ?

Deanna7332 That's really frustrating!

AFL JoyceM Mike, leave me E-Mail on when and how I can send your the $$ to
           get it.

AFL JoyceM Again...night all

Nuzz       gee John, I had to do something to explain the delay :)

ELECTMUSIC Thanks Gene for a GREAT chat!

AFC Eddie  Yes, Gene!  Great!

AFA Gene   Thanks Greg, 'night!

AFA Gene   thanx, see y'all later :)

Copyright 1987 Bob Szekely.

    John Michael Osbourne, (known as ""Ozzy"" to his fans), has in his long 
career as vocalist for Black Sabbath had his work with the group misconstrued 
as advocating Satanism.  In a 1983 radio special featuring Ozzy, the 
interviewer expressed precisely this point; ""...Ozzy has always been shrouded 
in the darkest of Satanic imagery.  Yet if you really listen to his music, 
you'll find that what he is saying differs greatly from his image....""(1)  Even 
the group's image has often been described as ""occult and diabolic"".(2)

    The important point to remember here is to differentiate between appearance 
and reality.  Although the name ""Black Sabbath"" conjures up images of witches 
and sorcerers paying homage to Satan for the powers bestowed upon them, this 
does not make it safe to assume that the group that went by this name 
necessarily drew the inspiration from the occult.(3)  The closest they ever 
came to it was a gothic horror film featuring Boris Karloff as narrator; they 
adopted their name directly from the name of this film.(4)  Black Sabbath was 
involved in the black arts as much as Karloff practiced casting spells off-
screen.  Tony Iommi, the group's guitarist, summed it up best when he described 
the group as having basically ""...the same appeal as a horror movie.  It's all 
an act.""(5)










    Just as their film counterpart did, Ozzy and Sabbath found the occult 
mythos to be an effective vehicle for powerful social commentary; particularly 
when put in the context of heavy-metal rock and roll.  Ozzy himself noted that 
there are ""...people who pick up my [album] cover[s] and go...'This guy's got 
to be singing about Devil, doom, death and destruction.'  Which is not the 
case....""(6)

    The late Lester Bangs likened the group to Bob Dylan and William Burroughs, 
describing them all as ""...moralists...trying to deal with a serious present 
situation in an honest way....""(7)  Ozzy and Black Sabbath merely bring to 
light the many evils of our world in their work, to try and make us realize 
that we are all victim to their influence.  They hope to make us recognize 
these evils so that we may take up arms against them; a point Ozzy emphatically 
stresses:  ""...one thing everybody has got to understand about Black Sabbath's 
lyrics.  They're not downer lyrics, they're just telling everybody where it's 
at...""(8)  He also cites the group's most controversial tune, ""Black Sabbath"", 
as a response to the ignorant hippie culture still force when the tune was 
written in 1970:  ""The hippies said: 'The world is beautiful man.' (sic)  You 
only had to look around you to see how crappy it was.  It was ridiculous 
listening to that stuff, let alone playing it, so we just wrote about the world 
the way it really was and how it affected us - and we felt better in ourselves 
because we were really being honest....""(9)

    I   1   HAVE YOU EVER THOUGH ABOUT YOUR SOUL-
        2   CAN IT BE SAVED?
        3   OR PERHAPS YOU THINK THAT WHEN YOU ARE DEAD
        4   YOU JUST STAY IN YOUR GRAVE.
        5   IS GOD JUST A THOUGHT WITHIN YOUR HEAD OR IS
        6   HE A PART OF YOU?
        7   IS CHRIST JUST A NAME THAT YOU READ IN A BOOK
        8   WHEN YOU WERE AT SCHOOL?

    II  9   WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT DEATH DO YOU LOSE
        10  YOUR BREATH OR DO YOU KEEP YOUR COOL?
        11  WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE THE POPE ON THE END
        12  OF A ROPE - DO YOU THINK HE'S A FOOL?
        13  WELL I'VE SEEN THE TRUTH - YES I'VE SEEN 
        14  THE LIGHT AND I'VE CHANGED MY WAYS.
        15  AND I'LL BE PREPARED WHEN YOU'RE LONELY 
        16  AND SCARED AT THE END OF OUR DAYS.

    III 17  COULD IT BE YOU'RE AFRAID OF WHAT YOU'R
        18  FRIENDS MIGHT SAY 
        19  IF THEY NEW YOU BELIEVED IN GOD ABOVE
        20  THEY SHOULD REALISE BEFORE THE CRITICISE
        21  THAT GOD IS THE ONLY WAY TO LOVE.

    IV  23  IS YOUR MIND SO SMALL THAT YOU HAVE TO FALL
        24 IN WITH THE PACK WHEREVER THEY RUN
        25  WILL YOU STILL SNEER WHEN DEATH IS NEAR
        26  AND SAY THEY MAY AS WELL WORSHIP THE SUN.

    V   27  I THINK IT WAS TRUE IT WAS PEOPLE LIKE YOU
        28  THAT CRUCIFIED CHRIST
        29  I THINK IT IS SAD THE OPINION YOU HADE WAS THE
        30  ONLY ONE VOICED.
        31  WILL YOU BE SO SURE WHEN YOUR DAY IS NEAR
        32  SAY YOU DON'T BELIEVE?
        33  YOU HAD THE CHANCE BUT YOU TURNED IT DOWN
        34  NOW YOU CAN'T RETRIEVE.










    VI  35  PERHAPS YOU'LL THINK BEFORE YOU SAY THAT
        36  GOD IS DEAD AND GONE
        37  OPEN YOUR EYES, JUST REALIZE THAT HE IS THE
        38  ONE.
        39  THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN SAVE YOU KNOW FROM
        40  ALL THIS SIN AND HATE.
        41  OR WILL YOU STILL JEER AT ALL YOU HEAR?
        42  YES!-I THINK IT'S TOO LATE.

    In this piece, the group asserts a belief in an afterlife and spiritual 
redemption.  As grisly as the image of a hanged pontiff is, its shock value is 
a necessary part of the message:  They reject religious dogma, stating that a 
belief in God, in one's own heart, is the only guiding light to help one inn 
his life (lines 11/12, 39/40).  Furthermore, the reject religious hypocrisy 
(lines 5/6, 7/8) and peer pressure (verses III, IV) as excuses for not 
accepting God.  To clarify further:  following the crowd does not justify 
shrugging responsibility for one's own actions.

    After re-reading, it becomes obvious that this song is an ascerbic critique 
of atheism; (line 35/36) I refer here again to verses three and four.  In these 
two verses, the picture painted in one of Godless conformity and how it's 
viewed as being as foolish as Paganism.  These lyrics set an example for the 
listener by relating personal experience (lines 13-16).  However, for those who 
cannot accept this the group has no recourse but to condemn them, although 
rather ironically; they hope that their rhetorical loss of faith in the 
listener will open his eyes (line 42).










                           B L A C K   S A B B A T H 



            WHAT IS THIS, THAT STANDS BEFORE ME?
            FIGURE IN BLACK, WHICH POINTS AT ME
            TURN ROUND QUICK AND START TO RUN
            FIND OUT I'M THE CHOSEN ONE.  OH, NO!
            
            BIG BLACK SHAPE WITH EYES OF FIRE
            TELLING PEOPLE THEIR DESIRE
            SATAN'S SITTING THERE, HE'S SMILING
            WATCHES THOSE FLAMES GET HIGHER AND HIGHER
            OH, NO, NO, -- PLEASE GOD HELP ME!
            
                IS THIS THE END MY FRIEND?
                SATAN'S COMING 'ROUND THE BEND
                PEOPLE RUNNING 'CAUSE THEY'RE SCARED
                THE PEOPLE BETTER GO AND BEWARE
                NO, NO!  PLEASE--NO!!
                
                
    The all time controversy winner!  Is this not irrefutably  THE song about 
Black Magic in rock?  It's all so obvious, suffuse with evil imagery; Satan, 
walls of flame, figure in black, and damnation at the end.  Yes, I see the 
images too; it definitely concerns Black Magic.  Then again, Shakespeare's 
Macbeth employed scenes of witches involved in conjurations; does that mean 
that Shakespeare was a warlock?  Poe used to write sardonic tragedies about 
twisted murderers and the bizarre nature of acts, did that make him an evil, 
leering, demented killer?  Did either of them advocated what they wrote about?  
One has to remember that writing about something is not necessarily the same as 
emulating it.  Tony Iommi spoke out quite strongly about this:  ""People are 
bringing us down saying that we are a Black Magic group.  I think they must be










getting mixed up with Black Widow.  We don't do any sacrifices on stage, and 
we're not on a black magic kick.  We wanted to do heavy numbers and the guitar 
riffs we worked out were more suited to evil things than love.  We play songs 
about black magic, but they are more likely to be against than for it.""(12)  

    By now, you're probably asking yourself who Black Widow is, right?  Then 
it's time for a little history:

        Sabbath, before they were known as Sabbath, had the same line-up but 
two earlier names.  The first one was Polka Tulk, which seemed sure to doom 
them to obscurity.(13)  The soon realized this and changed the group's name to 
Earth.  Now, Earth was a blues band at the end of the English blues boom.  As 
if that wasn't bad enough, they soon discovered that not only was there another 
group named Earth, but they had also released a single.  To avoid confusion, 
they changed their name again.(14)  But what made them decide on that name?  
Just ask Ozzy:  ""I just liked the name Black Sabbath because of the succession 
of vowel sounds.(15)  If that sounds ludicrous just consider this:  Sabbath was 
""...the first of the really committed, loud and heavy bands...""(16)  They 
needed a name to match the gut-wrenching power they were developing.  Tony knew 
that he wanted Sabbath to be noticed above all the rest of the British blues 
bands:  ""We wanted something of our own that we'd like and people would like.  
And we wanted something loud!""










    Tony didn't hate the blues.  He'd cut his teeth as a guitarist on the likes 
of The Shadows, Buddy Holly and Django Rheinhardt, developing his own style 
from there.  But he realized the group had no future in the blues:

        'We couldn't keep playing 12-bars forever.  We just got fed up with 
Earth music.  It was jazz, blues stuff.  It was good for practice but nothing 
else.'

    In the late 'Sixties, blues groups were a dime a dozen in Birmingham and 
interest was waning in the blues boom due to the glut of groups.  One man, by 
the name of Jim Simpson, had heard Earth around the Birmingham club circuit and 
understood what they were trying to do.  He decided to take them under his 
wing.  With the aid of his massive record collection, Jim expanded the group's 
horizons in the areas of jazz and blues.  He introduced them to artists like 
Wes Montgomery, Count Basie and Jimmy Rushing.  It was from Rushing in 
particular that they derived the repetitive riff style so readily noticeable in 
their later incarnation as Black Sabbath.

    The Count Basie influence is evidenced in the song ""Wicked World"" from the 
first album; Sabbath drummer Bill Ward uses a ""'sighing hi-hat'...in the manner 
of Basie's drummer Jo Jones.""










    The influence is subtle, almost subliminal.  Yet it is one which was not 
thought capable of hard, 'heavy' rock bands in the late 'Sixties.  Although Led 
Zeppelin and Jimi Hendrix also had their work steeped in blues and jazz 
derivations (Hendrix' ""Third Stone From the Sun"" and Zeppelin's version of 
Willie Dixon's ""I Can't Quit You Baby"" from their first album), neither was 
able to match the intense energy of Black Sabbath.  Iommi has always had a 
preference for music with an original, distinct style of its' own; as an 
example, he mentions guitarists Joe Pass and Alvin Lee as two of his strongest 
songwriting influences.

    It would also be necessary that Sabbath develop a unique, distinctive style 
and image of their own.  Though they had changed their name from Earth to Black 
Sabbath to avoid confusion with the other Earth; at the same time another group 
emerged by the name of Black Widow ""...who WERE profoundly influenced by the 
occult, had a male witch as a patron, and wrote pieces like ""Come to The 
Sabbat.""  Unfortunately, Sabbath was constantly reaping the benefits of Widow's 
publicity.

    Sabbath was a group that never minced words.  If they saw something as 
destructive, they would be sure to rub the listener's face it it.  They did not 
want their point to be missed.

    With their straightforward, sometimes brutal way of looking at things, they 
try to shock the listener's conscience back into awareness.  The imagery of 
""Hand of Doom"", from the Paranoid album, is candid and condemning; it is a 
strong statement against drug addiction and rightly so...

            PRICE OF LIFE YOU CRY
            NOW YOU'RE GONNA DIE
            
            
    Many people felt the group's overall direction was pessimistic and had a 
negative effect on its listener's due to that.  ""Ozzy insisted that if people 
thought he was having a bad effect on the minds of young kids, they should go 
and watch the TV news where real murder and mayhem were a way of life, and 
shown night after night."" (18)

    Sabbath was never negative in their message; they were simply truthful 
about waht they saw as wrong in the world.  If you ""Strip away the horror 
stories, the imagery and the hysteria, (and) turn down the amps a notch...you 
have a well-rehearsed, solid blues and rock band, powered by a dedication to 
well defined objectives.""  On the top of the list of those objectives was 
truth; Sabbath never feared facing that truth squarely, regardless of what many 
people thought of them.

Long, long, time ago,
I can still remember,
When the local calls were ""free"".
And I knew if I paid my bill,
And never wished them any ill,
That the phone company would let me be...

But Uncle Sam said he knew better,
Split 'em up, for all and ever!
We'll foster competition:
It's good capital-ism!

I can't remember if I cried,
When my phone bill first tripled in size.
But something touched me deep inside,
The day... Bell System... died.

And we were singing...

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

Is your office Step by Step,
Or have you gotten some Crossbar yet?
Everybody used to ask...
Oh, is TSPS coming soon?
IDDD will be a boon!
And, I hope to get a Touch-Tone phone, real soon...

The color phones are really neat,
And direct dialing can't be beat!
My area code is ""low"":
The prestige way to go!

Oh, they just raised phone booths to a dime!
Well, I suppose it's about time.
I remember how the payphones chimed,
The day... Bell System... died.

And we were singing...

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

Back then we were all at one rate,
Phone installs didn't cause debate,
About who'd put which wire where...
Installers came right out to you,
No ""phone stores"" with their ballyhoo,
And 411 was free, seemed very fair!

But FCC wanted it seems,
To let others skim long-distance creams,
No matter 'bout the locals,
They're mostly all just yokels!

And so one day it came to pass,
That the great Bell System did collapse,
In rubble now, we all do mass,
The day... Bell System... died.

So bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

I drove on out to Murray Hill,
To see Bell Labs, some time to kill,
But the sign there said the Labs were gone.
I went back to my old CO,
Where I'd had my phone lines, years ago,
But it was empty, dark, and ever so forlorn...

No relays pulsed,
No data crooned,
No MF tones did play their tunes,
There wasn't a word spoken,
All carrier paths were broken...

And so that's how it all occurred,
Microwave horns just nests for birds,
Everything became so absurd,
The day... Bell System... died.

So bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

We were singing:

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?

on that Resurrection Day!             where he'll hit you with a pie!

I hear Valkyries a-comin                There are people into Voodoo
In the air their song is comin          there are people into Voodoo
They forgot the words! They're hummin!  I know I do, I hope you do!
But they're good enough for me!         and it's good enough for me!

We will venerate Bubastis             We will read from the Kabahlah

We will all bow down to Enlil       There are some who practice Shinto
We will all bow down to Enlil       there are some who practice Shinto

With bold Gilgamesh the Brave!      but that's good enough for me!

We will all see Aphrodite               We will all sing Hare Krishna
Though she's pretty wild and flighty    We will all sing Hare Krishna
She will meet us in her nightie         It's not mentioned in the Mishna
And she's good enough for me!           But it's good enough for me!

It was good enough for Loki         We will all go to Nirvana

He thinks Thor's a little hokey     Make a left turn at Urbana

Here's to those who copy Conan    There will be a lot of lovin
Here's to those who copy Conan    when we're meetin in our Coven
They're just Followers of Onan    Quit yer pushin and yer shovin
and that's good enough for me!    So there's room enough for me!

We will have a mighty Party           It was good enough for Sappho
In the honor of Astarte               With her lady on her lap-o
Grab your chiton - don't be tardy     She put Lesbos on the map-o
'Cause she's good enough for me!      With her pagan poetry!

Shall we sing a verse for Venus,    Well the Christians all are humming
Of the Gods she is the meanest,     Cause they say their God is coming,
Cause she bit me on my...elbow      Our God came three times this evening
And it's good enough for me.        And that's good enough for me.

We will worship like the Druids,      Some guys have a circumcision
Drinking strange fermented fluids,    On account of their religion,
Running naked through the woo-ids,    An embarrassing incision
Coz that's good enough for me.        Cut just ENOUGH from me!   

We will sing a verse for Loki       It was good for old Jehovah
He's the old Norse god of Chaos     He had a son who was a nova!
Which is why this verse don't       Hey there, Mithras! Move on ova'!
       rhyme or scan or nothin'     Another resurrection Day!
But it's good enough for me...

It was good for Thor and Odin       It could be that you're a Parsi

There are those who, when they've got e-
Normous problems that are knotty
They just take them to Hecate         Thanks to great Quetzacoatl

Let us sing the praise of Horus    We went off to worship Venus
As our fathers did before us       By the Gods! You should have seen us!

And we sing in harmony!            But that's good enough for me!

Well, that's good enough for me!     To know that's right for me!

Lilith wears a lacy nightie        That Bob Larson shrieks and hollers

She's wet-dream enough for me!     And that's good enough for me.

And that's good enough for me.       So he's good enough for me.

And that's just fine with me.         They're both too much for me.

   Except perhaps to brush their teeth!

   AltChorus: Oh we fink, we fink, we fink,
              The Khan and the Kink, the Kink, the Kink,
              And the Board, their Great Senilities!
              The Western Irgun, drinks Imperium Compound
              And we're BACK, with results you'll see!    

   Lady Laurel, with Authority Royal,
   Passes and rejects our heraldry
   She needs a swig of Imperium Compound
   Then perhaps she'd deign to talk to me!            

   Lady Trude thought it her duty
   To turn a social wrong into a Right
   Proved her point with Imperium Compound
   And showed that Cheshire Cats can fight!  //and scratch//

   The Board of Directors styled themselves The Electors
   And another con they tried to swing
   Now the BoD drinks Imperium Compound
   So we no longer need a King!                        

   AltChorus: Oh the Bod, the BoD, the BoD,
              It thinks it is God, is God, is God,
              The figure of Supreme Authority!
              And if we O.D.'d on Imperium Compund
              there'd be no need for Royalty!          

   Oh, MEDIEVAL Net, we thought it was all wet
   With witty remarks, and other kinds of sass
   We'll feed our computers on Imperium Compound
   And BYTE the BoD right on its' righteous ass!         

   Good old Duncan was often drunken
   Chasing all the ladies fair
   He bathed himself in Imperium Compound
   Now he has a little savoir faire!

  ATEN IMPERIUM (cont.)

   Ioseph of Locksley, never changes his socks, he
   Runs around looking like a Cavalier,
   He stocked up on Imperium Compound
   And he has enough to last for years and years!        

   AltChorus: Oh they forgot, forgot, forgot
              The Locks-e-ly Plot, the Plot, the Plot!
              And it works the best when it is underground!
              It isn't a hassle for a green-and-white tassle
              They're the ones that BREW Imperium Compound!  

   Trelon of the Wood, he was very good, he
   Was a leader that had never been beat before;
   But Caid had Imperium Compound,
   And Imperial Roman Caid won the War!  //with help!//   

   In Tyr Ysgithr, it's regularly whispered there
   That the Kingdom is ruled over by a King    // What's THAT? //
   They're ""democratic"" and quite erratic....
   They've forgot the purpose of the whole damn thing!     

   King Sir Mark von, with his pretty white suit on,
   Rules the Kingdom both with Grace and Purity!
   He never touches Imperium Compound
   At least not where anyone else can see!               

   Duke Sir Deaton, was never beaten
   On the field, or in the drinking hall;
   At the Catbox War with Caid,
   Left thirty bodies piled against the wall!             

   Denis O'Titans was good at smitin'
   A Locksley Monster in every single way!
   Drank a little Imperium Compound
   And ATE Deaton's sword that day  // No! REALLY! //       

   Wotan the Mongoloid, a little bit paranoid,
   But a nice guy none the less;
   Drank a mess of Imperium Compound
   Now he's Justin du Roc, I confess!                       

   Then there's Duke Reynard, with a face like a St. Bernard
   Of the Dukes, he is the homliest
   He tends to toke up on Imperium Compound
   And go out and whomp on anybody's best!                   

   This song'll bedevil the folks at a revel,
   And most of the time it will annoy the King,
   So take a drink of Imperium Compound
   And let's go Royalty-bedeviling!                        

   Duchess Anna is quite a fan-a
   Going on a wartime shopping spree!  \\ War Point!\\
   Took a drink of Imperium Compound
   And shopped so fast we couldn't see! \\ Z-o-o-o-om!\\    (5)

  ATEN IMPERIUM (Cont.)

   Lyn of Whitewolfe, made of the right stuff,
   Twice the Queen of Atenveldt;
   Took a drink of Imperium Compound
   And the Kingdom of Caid before her knelt!              

   Duke Sir Brion, and Duke Sir Trelon,
   Won the Crown with regularity;
   Drank a lot of Imperium Compound,
   And founded a dynasty!                                 

   Stephan von Geist, was most awful nice,
   And a chivalrous fighter without any doubt
   Took a swig of Imperium Compound
   And won the Crown his first time out!                    

   All the Crusadenes were big, but not mean,
   And the finest fighters in the town.
   But they all drank Jerusalem Compound,
   Winning Crown after Crown after Crown!                 

   Good Duke Arthur couldn't get no farth-er
   A Norman King in Aten Land
   Drank too much of Imperium Compound
   And went off to conquer Engel-land!                    

   Then King Richard, a bit of a bitch, heard
   A King's Crown could be done.
   Drank a little Imperium Compound
   And became the Aten King, first one!                    

   Duchess Malinda, who doesn't do windas,
   But she does a lot of Duchess Things,
   But give her a LOT of Imperium Compound,
   And she sings and sings and sings and sings and sings!   

   Duke Sir Brion, with his pretty white suit on,
   Is a model of goodness and purity
   Never touches Imperium Compound
(spoken:) And I'll sell ya seashore property in Yuma, too!  

   Optional last verse:

   Many tales abound of Imperium Compound
   And its' strange effects on Royalty,
   But after an hour, this song has no power,
   And by now, it's boring ME!                            

   AltChorus: Oh it's too long, too long, too long
              To sing the whole song, the song, the song
              Longer than a Royal Court, it is!
              But sing it serial, this ditty Imperial
              And you'll be a bardic whiz!

        Last night I had the strangest dream in this bleak century
        I dreamed that people the world around believed in Chivalry

        I dreamed I saw a Kingly Crown enshrined in laurel leaves
        with Grace and Joy and Purity attendant at his feet

        I dreamed I saw the perfect Knight receive his accolade
        and minstrels sang and children laughed in some soft forest glade

        I dreamed I saw the finest thing that ever man could make
        grow great and strong and undefiled: Pray God I never wake!

        Last night I had the strangest dream in this bleak century
        I dreamed that people the world around believed in Chivalry

               (to the tune of ""Good King Wenceslaus"")

                Locksley Monsters never yield
                on the field of battle
                strike the helm and bash the shield
                make their eyeteeth rattle
                Bodies on the ground will lie
                bones will burst in sunder
                search for Locksleys' enemies:
                You'll find them six feet under!

                              SONG OF IVANOF

            There is a man who we know well that does the best he can
            but he's displayed in armour made of reticulated garbage cans!

            He looks so fine and fair and strong, oh how he plays the man
            and how it's prized, those galvanized, reticulated garbage cans

            The noblest Roman of them all, a good Praetorian
            a combatant who wears no pants, judst reticulated garbage cans!

            Like old Horatius at the Bridge, like the Legions of Valerian
            (O dearie me: those LOVELY knees!)
            and those reticulated garbage cans!

         (sung to the tune (obviously) of the 12 Days of Christmas)


1.           The first time I sent my device, The Heralds said to me

            ""It violates the Rule of Three""

2.           The next time I tried it, the Heralds said to me

            ""We changed the forms, and it violates the Rule of
             Three"".

3.           The third time I tried, and the Heralds said to me, 

            ""We upped the fees, we changed the forms, and it
             violates the Rule of Three"".

4.           Another time I tried and the Heralds said to me,
 
            ""We haven't got it, we upped the fees, we changed the 
             forms, and it violates the Rule of Three"".

5.           The fifth time I tried it, the Heralds said to me,  

            ""In a decision rendered by the College of Arms on
             August 1st, A.S. V it was decided that this style of
             heraldic design was not appropriate to the aims and 
             intentions of the Corporate Body. Holy! Holy! Holy! ""

 note: verse 5 is delivered in an extremely fast, mono-
       tone, similiar to a Gregorian Chant.

           "" ....we haven't got it, we upped the fees, we changed the forms,
             and it violates the Rule of Three.""

6.           I tried it a sixth time, and the Heralds said to me,

            ""We changed the rules, &c""

7.           A seventh time I tried and, the Heralds said to me,

            ""It's against the Rule of Tincture, we changed the
             rules, &c""

8.           I tried it once again and the heralds said to me,

            ""It's not a Period design, It's against the Rule of Tincture, We
             changed the rules, &c""

                                * more *



    Heralds Said To Me (cont.)

9.           I sent it in once more, and the Heralds said to me,

            ""We changed the rules again, It's not a Period design,
             it's against the Rule of Tincture, we changed the
             rules, &c""

10. (sung in cold anger)
             The LAST time I sent my device, the Heralds said to me

    (sung in a state of SMUG)
             ""Someone else has got it, &c""




              (nb: every single one of these reasons has been used by the
              CoA, at one point or another, to reject perfectly good
              heraldry, along with some even MORE stupid.  If the shoe 
              fits....................!!!!!!!!)

           or: Who was that Vermin I saw you with last, Knight?
   or: There may be Lice on all you Knice, but there ain't no Lice on me

           Once there was a Barony howling in the wilderness
           nestled in the Valley where the River doesn't flow
           and the folks were driven buggy by the insects in the Revel Hall
           Authenticity is wonderful, but this doesn't go!

                   Bugs on the Baroness, bugs on the Baroness!
                   That was the cry that you heard all the day
                   and the scratching can be heard from Ysgithr to Ered Sul
                   why did we come here? Let's go away!

           See them all a scratching, nestled in their armour tight
           the fleas have a melee team that's challenging the field!
           call Truly Nolen! Someone's gotta help us out!
           the crabs are nesting in our helms but we'll never yield!

                   (chorus)

           Dawn comes a-breaking, the bugs have won the Coronet...
           flea-infested Conan-clones in piles upon the lawn
           where is the Barony? The bugs have eaten everyone...
           termites got the stick-jocks, and all their sticks are gone!

                  For all the Lands where I have dwelt
                  Oh Atenveldt, Oh Atenveldt
                  till rivers burn and mountains melt
                  lest I forget my Atenveldt
                  From deserts stark to snow-capped peaks
                  from silent lakes and laughing creeks
                  sing: Oh let man find his heart's ease
                  on rocky plains
                  in desert breeze

                  For oft I thought of mighty men
                  who carved a Land with sword and pen
                  and lit a candle, burning bright,
                  that pierced the darkness; stirred the night!
                  tho some are gone their deeds remain
                  this sunny Crown without a stain
                  sing: Oh, their deeds were not in vain!
                  in sunlit days
                  and falling rain.....

                  So raise your banners, blazoned bright
                  Advance the Dream and Shine the Light!
                  in battle's crash and Revel's song
                  raise high the Flag and wave it long!
                  For all the Lands wherein I've dwelt
                  I love you best, my Atenveldt!
                  Sing: Oh the Joy that I have felt!

      What the use of wearing panties
      whalebone corsets of your Auntie's
      boxer shorts and other scanties
      best of all is nude
      there's such fun in going bra-less
      now that it's no longer lawless
      'specially if your figure's flawless
      best of all is nude
      nude is what you're born in
      shirts are never torn in
      underwear and lacy flimsies, garter belts and other whimsies
      yards of itchy cloth to put your form in
      ducks all do it, maidens rue it
      even ancient Picts in Britain blue it
      going naked's how to do it
      best of all is nude!

      If your garters aren't elastic
      tie them up in knots fantastic
      (panty hose is something drastic!)
      best of all is nude!
      If you're tired of wearing clotheses
      shed your garment 'mongst the roses
      never mind the old bluenoses
      best of all is nude!
      Nude is best for ducking!
      Worst for horses bucking!
      Moonlit nights will see such sights
          that are very best for fooling round
                              .....and elbows!
      Nudity is grand to see
       a well-known antidote to virginity
      take your clothes off and you'll see:
      best of all is nude!

                                  From the misty crystal sea
                                  came the Lady to the lea
                                  Sword and Roses in Her Hand
                                  spread their seeds thruout the Land

                                  Came the Stag from oaken wood
                                  saw the Lady where she stood
                                  by the fire burning bright
                                  came to know his heart's delight!

                   (end of extra verses)

                   By Sword and Harp, and Irish Hound
                   Blessed Be: the Day I've found
                   Hail to the Lady, one in Three
                   Present is Past and Past is WE

                   By Oak and Ash and Holy Thorn
                   bledded be the Day you're born!
                   Fire burn and fire bright

               they gently raised us from the slime
               and kept our hands from Hellishe Crime
               and made us a Kingdom in their own good time

               Now, Atenveldt forgets the Past

               when we shall all be....civilized....(puke)

                    WEAPONS AT THE DOOR

 Being a Polemic concerning the alleged Custom of the West Kingdom concerning 
 checking your Weapons at the Door of the Revel Hall. As the Satire is the 
 Weapon of the Bard, this said Polemic is to be checked at the Door, along with 
 swords, knives, redheaded Ladies and other such Deadly Things.....

         As I roved out to Western Lands to take the Western Air
         I went into a Revel Hall and I saw a Twelfth Night there
         but I was halted at the gate by a Privy Consellor
                 (that's the man who tells the King of the West how to go to
                  the bath room!)
         who told me I would have to check my Weapons at the door

         As I, in my astonishment, stood hung on tenter-pegs
         a Knight came in whose Prouess hung down between his legs
         the Doorman grabbed a greatsword and he struck the Knight full sore
         and gave him a reciept; he left his weapon at the door!

         a Bard was next whose goodly Voice has entertained us all
         but he, too, was prevented from entering the Hall
         and told he could not carry deadly weapons on the floor
         he left his Voice and Harp among the weapons at the door

         a Master entered graciously, a man we all know well
         who holds a 3rd Dan Black Belt, tho this he'd never tell
         the Master struggled valiantly, the Master cursed and swore
         but he left his hands, and feet, as weapons at the door

         the company was jovial, altho a bit dismayed
         for lack of proper cutlery, down to the smallest blade
         for even teeth and fingernails, each can be used in War
         were cut, and pulled, and left behind, as weapons at the door!

         And has their King not loyal Knights that He must be afraid
         of brawling in his Hall and of Assassin's bloody blade?
         the Rights of Men to carry Arms at least WE'VE not foreswore
         and a POX on them that made the Rule of Weapons at the Door!

                           THE STREETS OF ANN ARBOR

               As I walked out thru the streets of Ann Arbor
               as I walked out thru Ann Arbor one day
               I spied a young Mongol all dressed in white linen
               all dressed in white linen and cold as the clay

               I then spied another, done in on the sidewalk
               along with just about six dozen more
               their wounds were all gaping, from mace and from braoadsword
               from claymore and cannon, all dripping with gore

               what caused this grave carnage, I cried to the Monglos
               oh pray what's the reason for this awful sight
               my answer came slowly from under the corpse-pile
               ""It seems that our bark is much worse than our bite.....""

               the answer continued from pale lips a-shaking
               we sang all our songs and believed them as true
               the Dark Horde could never be beaten in battle
               we thought this was what all good Mongols could do...

               we went down to Atenveldt all for to plunder
               ""too large to defend"" was our song every night
               but Atenveldt's different from East, West or Middle
               there, even the bushes have learned how to bite!

               the Clann stole our ponies, the Scraelings our foodstuffs
               we ran into axes in AtenViking hands
               our maidens ran off with one Richard of Arkham
               and we're all that's left to return to our lands

               MacChluarains and Monsters, Lockehaven and Foxmoor
               that Kingdom is BIG and its' fighters are MEAN!
               we fought and we lost, and fled back to Ann Arbor
               we all came back home with results that you've seen

               keep away from that Land with its' cactus and marshes
               it's no place for Mongols who are bent on War
               they count their blows well, but they strick them yet better
               he crawled into his Yurt, and fell, dead, on the floor.....

                            C. A. Bethancourt III
       tune: the song of the Cowardly Lion, Tin Woodsman and Scarecrow
             in the movie version of the Wizard of Oz

        (Enter the Scarecrow, who singeth:)

        My wife is always nagging; my Prowess it is lagging
        I can't do anything
        she has got a reason, but revenge is out of season
        Oh I wish I could be King!

        If I just had the Crown on, I'd always have a frown on
        and the Barons on a string
        Heads they would be rolling, the Board would be cajoling
        Oh if only I was King!

        I am very fed up with the way this group is set up
        Oh I'd change everything!
        they are so high and mighty with the way that they do fight-ey
        Oh, someday I'll be King!

        Tho my wife is melancholic, and very...vitriolic
        she's a wasp without a sting!
        I'd have to supervise her with a pack of tranquilizers
        If I only was a King......

        (the Tin Woodsman joineth him, and singeth:)

        I grew up kind of cocky, and rather big, and stocky
        and straight as any rod
        on the field I'm a battallion, with the Ladies I'm a stallion
        ...Oh they'd better make me God!

        The other boys are jealous they say I'm over-zealous
        they'd do better to applaud
        the things that I am giving to this Dream that we are living
        oh I wish they'd make me God!

        They say that I'm conceited, but I'm just badly treated
        by people and by BoD
        just think of what they're missing by My Majesty dismissing
        Oh they'd better make me God!

        (the Cowardly Lion creepeth forth, and singeth:)

        Oh I could be a fighter, a great and mighty smiter
        and be the perfect knight
        it's a great and nasty shame, and everyone's to blame
        oh I wish that I could fight!

        Song of the Three (cont.)

        I could be a Cavalier drinking wine and ale and beer
        and be a gorgeous sight
        but it would cost me too much money so it isn't very funny
        oh I wish that I could fight!                               

        Let me at 'em on the field, I would surely make them yield
        to my Power and my Might
        with rattan, shinai and rapier they would nevermore escape here
        If they'd only let me fight

                She was afraid to come out to the Tourney
                She was worried that ""something might show..""
                She was afraid to come out to the Tourney
                And the poor thing did NOT want to go...

                  (2 - 3 - 4, tell the people what she wore!)

                  It was an itsy bitsy teeny weenie little rabbit fur bikini
                  That she wore, for the first time, that day.
                  An itsy bitsy teenie weenie little rabbit fur bikini
                  And in her apartment she wanted to stay!

                One day in the Kingdom of the Middle
                It happened at a Tourney one day:
                The Mongols invaded the Middle
                But the Middle did not want to play...

                  (eins - zwei - drei, but the Dark Horde wouldn't die!)

                  It was an itsy bitsy tiny teenie Nauseating Mongol weenie
                  That they saw, for the first time, that day.
                  An itsy bitsy tiny teenie Nauseating Mongol weenie
                  And the Mongols did NOT go away!

                Now the Heralds made up a new Rulebook
                And to read it is some kind of gas!
                It's a bureaucrat's dream, this new Rulebook
                Now NOBODY'S blazon can pass!

                  (Win - Place - Show, tell the Heralds where to go!)

                                 (insert Bronx cheer!)

                  I want an itsy bitsy teenie weenie little rabbit fur bikini
                  On my shield, as my blazon, today!
                  An itsy bitsy teenie weenie little rabbit fur bikini
                  But ""that's offensive"" the Heralds all say!

                I sat down at the Revel last evening
                To a feast of green meat, and Rat Pie...
                It was cold, and disgusting, and greasy
                And I just want to upchuck and die!

                  (6 - 7 - 8, tell them what was on your plate!)

                  It was an itsy bitsy teenie weenie little rabbit fur bikini
                  With a side dish of cold cabbage pie!
                  An itsy bitsy teenie weenie little rabbit fur bikini

          Some folks call me many names, others call me crazy
          Tom O'Bedlam's son am I, for my mind is hazy!
          I'd rather sing a song than work (if it's not too phrasey!)
          Lengthy rhymes don't bother me....truth to tell: I'm lazy!

          Yang, your yurt is very nice, and your Horde is smelly,
          And I'm sure that yak-meat will nicely fill one's belly!
          But remember this one line, or you're not worth jelly:
          FIRST you plunder, THEN you burn! That's how to be rakehelly!

          My Lady Lorelei your eyes do drive me to distraction
          And the lovely Care-Cheri causes....petrifaction!
          But I, and they, quite taken are, so I can't take action...
          Therefore, Ladies, fill my cup; I'll drink to stupefaction!

          Now Atenveldt your fighters, all, are most good and gentle
          And the Ladies, bless 'em all, are most ornamental!
          But that little Nikki-Toad....has me sentimental
          Though with boffer in her hand she is argumental!

          This stupid little song, m'lords, is mostly sung in Latin
          By the Goliards, of course, from vespers clear to matins!
          But I prefer a coarser cloth over silk or satins
          English is more understood, mine enemies to flatten!

          Good People all, I've made my Song, its' music's well-recited
          But my voice could use some work; the flowers it has blighted!
          It's rude and rusty, grim and bad, and squeaky like a door-hinge,
          But I'm a better Bard than you: I found a rhyme for ""orange!""

                      by William Poundstone
                              1983

     Two mentalities are at work here: 1960s rock fans and 1980s
fundamentalist Christians. The idea of phonographically concealed
messages dates from the Paul McCartney death scare of 1969. For
hard-core types, the secret-message rumors never really died. Avid
rock fans have auditioned ever album release since the late 1960s
for hidden nuances. Backward messages, barely audible messages,
and messages on one stereo track only have been alleged. At the
other end of the sociosensual spectrum, fundamentalist Christians
have gotten into the act. TV programs such as PRAISE THE LORD and
THE 700 CLUB have propagated rumors of a satanic plot in the
recording industry, no less, in which various albums conceal
""backward-masked"" demonic murmurings. If THAT sounds too spacey to
be taken seriously, consider that it was the fundamentalist groups
who were behind House Resolution 6363, a bill introduced in the
U.S. House of Representatives by Robert K. Dornan (R., Calif.) in
1982 to label all suspect records: ""WARNING: THIS RECORD CONTAINS
BACKWARD MASKING THAT MAKES A VERBAL STATEMENT WHICH IS AUDIBLE
WHEN THIS RECORD IS PLAYED BACKWARD AND WHICH MAY BE PERCEPTIBLE
AT A SUBLIMINAL LEVEL WHEN THIS RECORD IS PLAYED FORWARD."" In
February 1983, the Arkansas State Senate passed a similar record-
labeling bill by a vote of 86 to 0.
     Contributing to the quasi-occult status of these rumors is
the difficulty of checking them out on home audio equipment. You
pretty much have to take someone else's word for it, or dismiss
the rumors out of hand.
     From a technical standpoint, there are four simple ways to
conceal a verbal message on a recording. The most obvious is to
record the message at a very low volume. The message may then be
recovered by turning the volume up while playing the record or
tape. If the message is faint enough, though, noise levels of home
equipment may garble it. If the accompanying music or lyrics are
loud enough, or if the message itself is indistinct or
electronically modified, it may be hard to hear on any equipment.
     A second gimmick is to record a message on one stereo track
only. Records and tapes have two independent recordings, of
course, normally played simultaneously for stereo effect. On a
record, each stereo track occupies on one side of the V-shaped
groove for the needle. On a tape, the tracks are recorded in
parallel lanes of the magnetic material. The two tracks are called
""right"" and ""left"" after the stereo speakers they will play on.
Otherwise, the tracks are interchangeable -- the sound mixer can
put anything he or she wants on each track. A message on one track
can be masked by simultaneous loud music or lyrics on the opposite
track. With normal stereo balance (or mono equipment) the loud
track drowns out the message track. At home, single-track messages
can be recovered by adjusting the stereo balance so that only the
desired track plays. Sometimes this trick also makes indistinct
words clearer. Even if the words are not exclusively on one track,
they may happen to be more audible on one track.
     A message could be recorded at a speed different from the
rest of the record. Then the record would have to be played faster
or slower than usual to recover the message. Unless the message
was at one of the standard speeds (say, 45 rpm on a 33 1/3 rpm
record), it could not be played normally on home equipment.
     The fourth and most commonly alleged trick is to record a
verbal message backward. Reversed speech has several unexpected
features. One is that syllables are not a constant in the reversal
process. A one-syllable word can have two or three syllables when
played backward. Thus ""number nine"" in the Beatles' REVOLUTION 9
reverses to ""Turn me on, dead man"" (or something like it), a jump
from three to five syllables.
     There is no simple way to predict what a word or phrase will
sound like reversed. Obviously, you can't just reverse the
letters.
     Reversed messages are difficult to recover at home. Record
turntables are not built to go backwards. Some have a neutral
setting, in which the pickup and amplifier remain active and you
can turn the record backward by hand. But hardly anyone has a
stead enough hand to produce satisfactory results.
     With patience, it is possible to reverse a cassette
recording. Transfer the music from the original record or tape
onto a blank tape cassette. Place the cassette flat on a table.
Draw our the part of the tape with the suspected message and snip
it off at both ends. Hold the tape segment horizontally. Rotate it
180 degrees, keep it horizontal at all times. This turns the tape
end for end. Splice the reversed tape segment back onto the two
loose ends of the cassette with strong adhesive tape. Reel the
tape back inside the cassette. The sliced segment will play
backward on an ordinary cassette player.
     I rented a recording studio to test the secret-message
rumors. New copiies of the records in question were transcribed on
a quarter-inch master tape. Where rumor alleged that a single
stereo track contained a message, right and left stereo tracks
were transcribed separately. Records with alleged inaudible
messages were treated similarly. To test claims of reversed
messages, recordings on the master tape were edited out and
spliced in backward. Twenty cuts or portions of cuts from sixteen
albums were tested.


""Another One Bites the Dust""
Queen, THE GAME

Rumor: When played backward, the lyrics say, ""It's fun to smoke
marijuana.""
Findings: There is something that sounds like ""It's fun to smoke
marijuana"" in the reversed music. It is repeated over and over. It
might be rendered no less faithfully, however, as ""sfun to scout
mare wanna."" This ""message"" is the reversal of the song title,
which is repeated as a line in the song.
     Let's make a distinction between engineered and phonetic
reversals. When an artist records a verbal statement, reverses it
by turning the tape end for end, mixes the reversed statement onto
a master tape, and has records and tapes produced from the master,
that is an engineered reversal. When the phonetic properties of
song lyrics are such that they can be reversed to sound like
something else, that is a phonetic reversal.
     ""It's fun to smoke marijuna"" is clearly a phonetic reversal.
The lyrics are perfectly plain played forward (""Another one bites
the dust""), no so plain played backward (""sfun to scout mare
wanna""). With an engineered reversal, the opposite should hold
true: gibberish forward, clear as a bell backward. Some are
prepared to believe that phonetic reversals are just as
intentional as engineered reversals -- that the songwriter
painstakinginly planned the phonetic double-entendre. In the
absence of confirming evidence, that just doesn't wash. It's too
easy to find coincidences. If, for example, the letters of the
alphabet are recited in conventional fashion (Ay, Bee, Cee, etc.)
and reversed, at least five sound like English language words. D
reverses to ""eden,"" F becomes ""pray,"" S becomes ""say,"" V becomes
""even,"" and Z becomes ""easy."" ""It's fun to smoke marijuana"" is
likewise a coincidence.


""A Child is Coming""
Jefferson Starship, BLOWS AGAINST THE EMPIRE

Rumor: When played backward, ""son of Satan.""
Findings: Another phonetic coincidence. The repeated ""It's getting
better"" reverses to an iffy ""son of Satan,"" the ""of"" drawn out and
the ""Satan"" strongly accented on the first syllable.


""Eldorado""
Electric Light Orchestra, ELDORADO

Rumor: When played backward, ""He is the nasty one/ Christ, you're
infernal/ It is said we're dead men/ Everyone who has the mark
will live.""
Findings: Coincidence. The supposed message lurks around the line
""On a voyage of no return to see."" Reversed, this passage becomes
the expected syllable salad -- no one hearing it would describe it
as anything but reversed music. Only if you listen while reading
along with what you're supposed to hear will you get anything. The
rumored version of the message is somewhat fudged. The passage
sounds more like ""He's to nasty one/ Christ you are, Christ,
you're fernal/ There wiss uh, we're dead men..."" There is no ""in""
in what is taken to be ""infernal."" The line that is supposed to be
""Everyone who has the mark will live"" isn't even close, though the
syllable count is right.


""Shoo Be Doo""
The Cars, CANDY-O

Rumor: When played backward, the word ""Satan"" repeated
approximately eleven times.
Findings: Coincidence. The rumor refers to the reversal of the ""Shoo
be doo, shoo be doo, shoo be doo..."" near the end of the song. Given
the mysterious logic of reversed phonemes, these three-syllable units
can be hard as a repeated two-syllable word. The word sounds a little
like ""Satan.""


""Snowblind""
Styx, PARADISE THEATER

Rumor: According to a mimeographed list of suspect records distributed
by Congressman Dornan, the words ""Satan move through our voices"" when
played backwards.
Findings: Negative. Despite repeated listenings, it was not even
possible to identify the part of the reversed track that Dornan et al.
are talking about.


""Stairway to Heaven""
Led Zeppelin, untitled, a.k.a. STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN

Rumor: In reverse, ""I live for Satan... The Lord turns me off...
There's no escaping it... Here's to my sweet Satan... There's power in
Satan... He will give you 666.""
Findings: Coincidence. If you listen very carefully to the ""And it
makes me wonder"" lines in reverse, you'll hear something approaching
""There's no escaping it."" A better description is ""There's no escape
do."" Knock of the last syllable, and you have ""There's no escape,"" a
complete, intelligible sentence in reverse. It's there, all right, but
it's not an unlikely enough coincidence to -- well, make you wonder.
      The ""Satan"" in ""I live for Satan"" is good and clear. The ""I live
for"" part isn't. The other alleged lines are unremarkable. All are
phonetic reversals of the entirely lucid forward lyrics and obviously
just accidents.


""When Electricity Came to Arkansas""
Black Oak Arkansas, BLACK OAK ARKANSAS and RONCH AND ROLL

Rumor: In reverse, ""Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan. He is God. He
is God.""
Findings: The BLACK OAK ARKANSAS cut was reversed. Again, pairs of
reversed syllables are being freely interpreted as ""Satan."" ""He is
God"" was not identifiable.


""Rain""
The Beatles, HEY JUDE

Rumor: Unintelligible lyrics at the end are reversed.
Findings: A true engineered reversal and not really a secret. ""Rain""
seems to have been the first popular recording to incorporate an
obviously reversed lyric. The story is that John Lennon accidentally
spliced the last part of the song in backward and liked the effect.
When reversed, the strange-sounding vocals at the end become
intelligible as a reprise starting with the drawn-out word
""sunshine.""
      The reversal is less apparent to the casual listener than it
might be because the accompanying music is not reversed. The ending
fits in smoothly with the rest of the song, the vocals suggesting a
foreign language.


""Fire on High""
Electric Light Orchestra, FACE THE MUSIC

Rumor: When played backward, ""The music is reversible, but time --
turn back!""
Findings: ""Fire on High"" is instrumental. About twenty-six seconds
into the music, scrambled speech is heard. It is mostly louder than
the accompanying music and begins with a two-syllable unit repeated
several times. The seeming speech lasts for about fourteen seconds.
      Reversing the music confirms that there is a true, engineered
message. In reverse, a voice (Jeff Lynne's?) says, ""The music is
reversible, but time -- turn back! Turn back! Turn back! Turn back!""
All the words are clear and unambiguous. Anyone comparing this to the
alleged reversal on ELO's ""Eldorado"" will have no trouble telling
which is genuine.


""Goodbye Blue Sky""
Pink Floyd, THE WALL

Rumor: In reverse, ""You have discovered the secret message.""
Findings: The ""secret message"" is at the very end of the instrumental
passage following the ""Goodbye Blue Sky"" vocals. It comes just before
the words ""What shall we do"" at the start of the song that is
identified as ""Empty Spaces"" on the record label and as ""What shall we
do now?"" on the record sleeve. Played forward, the message is less
apparent than the FACE THE MUSIC reversal: A reasonably attentive
listener might play THE WALL through and not catch it. It suggests
speech not quite close enough to be overheard. In context this is not
unusual because the ""Goodbye Blue Sky"" instrumental passage includes
""airport noises"" and other sound effects. A loud climax in the music
further masks the unintelligible voice.
      When played backward, the voice (Roger Waters?) plainly intones,
""Congratulations, you have just discovered the secret message. Please
send your answer to old Pink, care of the funny farm..."" As the voice
fades out, there may be another word -- perhaps ""Chalfonte or
""Chelsea"" -- after ""funny farm.""


""Heavy Metal Poisoning""
Styx, KILROY WAS HERE

Rumor: A red sticker on the KILROY WAS HERE cover warns, ""By order of
the Majority for Musical Morality, this album contains secret backward
messages...""
Findings: This is a case of second-generation backward-masking. Styx'
PARADISE THEATER did not contain a backward message, though a lot of
people said it did. So Styx has included a sure enough backward
message on KILROY WAS HERE. It is at the very beginning of ""Heavy
Metal Poisoning."" The reversed speech last about three seconds. There
is no musical background. The words reverse to ""Annuit coeptis. Novus
ordo seclorum."" This is the Latin motto encircling the pyramid on the
back of a dollar bill. The usual translation: ""God has favored our
undertakings. A new order of the ages.""
      The cover sticker's ""Majority for Musical Morality"" is a
fictitious Falwellesque group in the KILROY WAS HERE video. Although
the sticker suggests a plurality of ""messages,"" only one was found.


Space between ""I'm So Tired"" and ""Blackbird""
The Beatles, untitled, a.k.a. THE WHITE ALBUM

Rumor: A reversed message. At the time of the Paul-is-dead stories,
the segue from ""I'm So Tired"" to ""Blackbird"" was offered as evidence.
It was held to contain John Lennon's voice, reveresed, saying ""Paul is
dead, miss him, miss him, miss him."" That interpretation seems
unlikely now, but there is a mysterious low muttering between the
songs.
Findings: The mumbling is actually just to the ""I'm So Tired"" side of
the shiny ""space"" between cuts on the record. Each of the stereo
tracks was recorded separately, twice, and a copy of each track was
reversed. This produced four versions of the two-second passage: right
forward, left forward, right reversed, and left reversed. All were
equally unintelligible. It was not even apparent whether the voice is
forward or reversed. Nor could John Lennon be identified as the
speaker. There are nine or ten syllables. The first six (when played
forward) are a two-syllable unit repeated three times. There is little
or no difference betwen the stereo tracks. Any claimed interpretation
of the sounds seems doubtful.


""Strawberry Fields Forever""
The Beatles, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR

Rumor: It was, of course, claimed that John Lennon says ""I buried
Paul"" at the end. (It's forward, at the very end after the music
fades to complete silence, returns, and starts to fade out again.)
But Lennon told ROLLING STONE that the words are ""cranberry
sauce.""
Findings: They are ""cranberry sauce."" The ""sauce""/""Paul"" part is
indistinct, but the first syllable sounds a lot more like ""cran""
than ""I.""


""Baby You're a Rich Man""
The Beatles, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR

Rumor: On one of the tracks the line ""Baby you're a rich man too""
is sung as ""Baby you're a rich fag Jew,"" a dig at Brian Epstein.
Or some think it's ""rich fat Jew"" and claim it as evidence of
Beatle anti-Semitism.
Findings: Negative. The two stereo tracks are nearly identical.
It's always possible to hear words as similar-sounding words, but
basically, the lyrics jibe with the published version.


""Revolution 9""
The Beatles, untitled, a.k.a. THE WHITE ALBUM

Rumor: Various reversed and/or one-track speech. The reversal of
""Number nine"" to ""Turn me on, dead man"" has pretty much been
discounted as coincidence (though it appears on Congressman
Dornan's list).
Findings: Distinction between lyrics and any hidden message blurs
on ""Revolution 9."" The eight-minute cut is a montage of sounds
collected by John Lennon and Yoko Ono. It includes discordant
music, radio broadcasts, sirens, applause, gunfights, sports
cheers, the crackling of a fire, screams, a baby gurgling, a choir
singing, and much that cannot be identified. For this
investigation, ""Revolution 9"" was transcribed four times, twice on
each stereo channel. One copy of each of the tracks was reversed.
The four resulting versions were compared with each other and
against the original two-channel version.
     ""Revolution 9"" contains a lot of talking. Played in stereo,
forward, the longest stretch of understandable speech is probably
an announcer saying, ""...every one of them knew that as time went
by they'd get a little bit older and a little bit slower...""
     One believable instance of reversed speech occurs: someone
saying ""Let me out! Let me out!"" (once held to represent McCartney
in his totaled Aston-Martin). Two iffy reversals occur on the
backward recording of the right stereo track:""She used to be
assistant"" and ""There were two men..."" Neither is clear enough or
long enough to be convincing. Some of the music, including the
recurring theme, sounds more natural in reverse.
     ""Turn me on, dead man"" is a typical phonetic reversal. The
forward ""number nine"" (repeated throughout the cut) is clear; the
reversal is slurred -- something like ""turn me on dedmun."" It has
been claimed that ""number nine"" must be pronounced with a British
accent or with some careful inflection in order to reverse to
""Turn me on, dead man."" This seems not to be so. As an experiment,
three American-accent renderings of ""number nine"" were reversed.
All sound about as much like ""Turn me on, dead man"" as the record
did. Like the other phonetic reversals, ""Turn me on, dead man""
must be considered a coincidence.
     Much of ""Revolution 9"" is on one stereo track only. Near the
end a voice says ""A fine natural imbalance...the Watusi...the
twist...Eldorado...Eldorado."" ""A fine natural imbalance"" is on the
right track only, though the words that follow are in stereo. One
of the longer bits of speech -- ""Who could tell what he was
saying? His voice was low and his [unintelligible] was high and
his eyes were low"" -- is clear on the left track, a bare whisper
on the right.
     There is a stereophonically concealed ""secret message"" on
""Revolution 9."" The words are on the right track. They begin about
four minutes, fifty-eight seconds into the cut and run for about
twenty-two seconds. They are not likely to be noticed in stereo
because of the much louder left track. The sound of applause
begins on the left track at about five minutes, one second into
the cut. Deafening noises -- the clapping, sirens, music --
continue on the left track until five minutes, forty seconds. It
may or may not have been Lennon's and Ono's intention to conceal
the spoken passage. Given the haphazard quality of ""Revolution 9,""
the concealment may have been accidental. To recover the passage,
the left track must be switched off. The right track can then be
heard to contain a sound like a stopwatch ticking, behind these
words:

     So the wife called, and we better go to see a
     surgeon....[A SCREAM MUFFLES A LINE THAT SOUNDS LIKE
     Well, what with the prices, the prices have snowballed,
     no wonder it's closed.] ...So any and all, we went to
     see the dentist instead, who gave him a pair of teeth,
     which wasn't any good at all. So instead of that he
     joined the bloody navy and went to sea.
                      by William Poundstone
                              1986

     There really are backward messages on rock albums. And the
controversy over ""backward masking"" and ""porn rock"" has inspired a
whole new spate of messages. There may have been more genuine
backward messages in the past few years than ever before.
     The backward message controversy is usually traced to the
1960s and John Lennon's avant-garde sound mixing on such tracks as
""Revolution 9"" on the Beatles' WHITE ALBUM. Lennon probably wasn't
trying to conceal a message so much as create an interesting
sound.
     The matter might have ended right there had it not been for
the Paul McCartney death rumor. College kids tried playing Beatles
records forward, backward, and at various speeds to find ""clues""
to McCartney's fate. In the process they found snippets of speech
from Lennon's experiments. Even after McCartney was found safe and
sound in Scotland, some listeners continued to look for hidden
messages.
     Somehow, fundamentalist Christian groups became convinced
(ca. 1982) that the alleged messages were commercials for devil
worship. Not a single indisputable satanic message has turned up,
but there were scattered attempts to ban or label certain albums.
In 1986 one fundamentalist group announced that the theme song for
the old MR. ED TV show contains the word ""Satan"" when played
backward.)
     Ironically, the publicity accorded nonexistent messages has
inspired several artists -- among them porn rock hearing witness
Frank Zappa -- to hide real background messages in their music.
It's easy to do.
     The performer speaks or sings the message normally, then
reverses the tape, which is mixed into the soundtrack. This is all
accomplished simply enough at any recording studio.
     What's not so simple is playing it back. More home record,
cassette, and compact disk players won't play backward. You can
turn a record backward with a pencil eraser, but it's not good for
the needle or the turntable. The only way to reproduce the message
with full fidelity is to use a professional-quality reel-to-reel
tape player and splice the tape in backward.
     We used the facilities of KLOS radio in Los Angeles to
reverse some recent records containing true backward messages.


""Secret Messages""
Electric Light Orchestra, SECRET MESSAGES

ELO's ELDORADO album was among those alleged to contain satanic
backward masked messages. A patient listening to ELDORADO played
backward reveals no such messages. You hear only what you ought to
hear -- the reversed lyrics of the songs, which sound nothing like
the ""messages"" claimed to be there. In the wake of such
allegations, ELO did put an (innocuous) backward message on their
FACE THE MUSIC album. Perhaps they thought this would show how
silly the allegations were. Instead, the backward-masking people
seized on this as proof that the other ""messages"" were real. In
the latest volley, ELO has named an album after the controversy.
     In Britain (where the backward-masking issue is viewed as an
American eccentricity), the cover of SECRET MESSAGES has a mock
warning label to youth about the hidden label. Word of the albums'
impending release in the United States caused enough of a furor to
chill CBS Records into deleting the cover blurb.
     The reversed message is easy to find. It's at the beginning
of the first song, which is itself called ""Secret Messages."" You
can hear reversed speech when you play the record normally. A
voice intones ""secret messages"" -- forward -- in the middle of the
reversed speech, lest anyone dare be so unhip as to not know
what's going on.
     We transferred a new copy of SECRET MESSAGES to reel-to-reel
tapes and played it backward. The backward message goes: ""WELCOME
TO THE BIG SHOW/ WELCOME TO THE BIG SHOW.""
     That's it.


""Ya Hozna""
Frank Zappa, THEM OR US

""Ya Hozna,"" a six-minute composition on the first record of the
THEM OR US double album, is ENTIRELY backward. The albums' inner
cover, which includes lyrics for the other songs, says, ""backwards
vocal -- you figure it out"" of this cut. It credits Frank and Moon
Zappa, George Duke, and Napoleon Murphy Brock as vocalists.
     Played forward, ""Ya Howza"" sounds like a record played
backward -- reasonably so. The vocals are prominent and
unintelligible. Moon Zappa's voice is curiously recognizable, even
in reverse. It is hard to tell whether the music was recorded
forward or backward.
     When ""Ya Howza"" is played in reverse, you discover that the
music is virtually a palindrome -- it sounds about the same
forward and backward. The voices are all backward. In some cases
they have been modified electronically. Many of the words are
muffled. Even after repeated careful listening on both stereo
tracks, it is difficult to make out many of the lyrics. It doesn't
help that some of the words seem to be stream-of-consciousness
nonsense. Some of the unintelligible stuff sounds like opera.
     Starting at the beginning of the reversed tape -- the end of
the forward tape -- the clearer vocals go like this: ""I am the
heaven, I am the water."" This is in a hymnlike register. ""You are
a lonely little girl./ But your mommy and your daddy hold you."" A
singsong synthesizer voice.
     The most interesting part of the lyrics is an intermittently
orgasmic rap in Moon Zappa's Valley Girl voice. There are three
short monologues:

I'm like green!
I'm like squat!
I'm like soul!
Repeat, like soul!
I'm like pull, push,
Okay, like slow, slow.

You're never too old
Like slow, like slow, like slow
Okay, I like it.


All right, faster, faster,
Go, do it, do it twice,
Yeah, that feels good,
I'm looking great,
Yeah, fer shure!
Like, no way!


""No Anchovies, Please""
J. Geils Band, LOVE STINKS

""No Anchovies, Please"" is a novelty song, really a narration with
sound effects, about a woman who is kidnapped after eating
anchovies. She is taken to a ""foreign-speaking"" country. The sound
effect of the foreign tongue seems reversed. When you do play it
in reverse, it becomes: ""It doesn't take a genius to know the
difference between chicken shit and chicken salad.""


""Darling Nikki""
Prince, PURPLE RAIN

""Darling Nikki,"" cited as porn rock before Congress, is about a
dominatrix in a hotel lobby masturbating with a magazine. In part,
the complaint was that the album cover (flowers, and Prince on a
motorcycle) wasn't explicit enough to warn kids of the suggestive
lyrics. Senator Paula Hawkins apparently was not aware of a
backward message hidden in ""Darling Nikki."" The last thirty-five
seconds of the song is gibberish. The music changes abruptly and
becomes a repeated glottal sound. Then a two-syllable sound is
repeated twice, something like ""heaven, heaven."" Unintelligible
speech follows. At the end is a sound reminiscent of rain or bacon
frying , and wind sounds.
     Played backward, the message becomes:

     Hello, how are you?
     I'm fine 'cause I know that the Lord is coming soon.
     Coming, coming soon.

     It is clearly Prince and the Revolution singing this. The
words are clear but the intonation is funny -- the linger on some
words. Perhaps this is to make the reversed message you hear
playing the record normally a little less conspicuous.
     This is a weird reversal of the supposed secret message
menace. Raunchy forward lyrics conceal a religious secret message.


""Judas Kiss""
Petra, MORE POWER TO YOU

Petra is an obscure group that sings religious songs to a rock
beat. As further proof that things have gone full circle, the
backward-masking controversy prompted Petra to include a wholesome
backward message on their MORE POWER TO YOU album. It is in the
transition between two songs, just before ""Judas Kiss."" Clearly
audible gibberish reverses to this (the husky voice a cross
between George Beverly Shea and Dee Snider): ""What are you looking
for the Devil for, when you ought to be looking for the Lord?""

AFL JoyceM Welcome to the Apple II Music & Sound chat - our discussion will
           be on NoiseTracker - the new FTA music program for the GS.  AFA
           Gene will be our host this evening...Gene, the floor is yours :)

AFA Gene   Hi all... well first I'd like to point out, if y'all aren't aware
           yet, that a spanking new version of NoiseTracker has recently
           been released (9 days ago) and is now available in our New Files
           library. It is version 0.5. I haven't played around with it much
           yet, but it's supposed to fix a lot of the little bugs in 0.3
           (the first version we had online).  NoiseTracker also includes
           the ability to directly import ""modules,"" a term used for a
           certain type of Amiga song file which has become popular among PC
           users using the SoundBlaster sound card.

           Now, via NT, these ""MOD"" files are accessible by the GS. We
           expect to see a lot of activity on this end as far as ports from
           the PC and Amiga go. Note that you should be able to go straight
           to the PC music forum and download any recently uploaded MOD
           songfiles (there was a bug in the first wide release of the PCAO
           software, however, so a bunch of files with dates between around
           March 1991 and September 1991 may not download properly. Note that
           to use these PC MOD files, you'll have to rename the downloaded
           file ""MOD.xxxxxx"" if you want it to show up automatically in NT's
           ""open"" dialog box. (On the PC, all MOD files are named
           ""xxxxxxxx.MOD"" instead.)   Also, if the files are packed with ZIP
           compression, you'll need a program from the Communications Forum
           called AGATE -- it's a terminal program that includes the ability
           to unpack ZIP files.

           Now, I guess the best thing to do would be to talk about our
           favorite songfiles... there have been a few complaints, in fact,
           that people were not being ""descriptive"" enough in their file
           descriptions for uploads in describing the songs.

AFC Eddie  ?

AFA Gene   GA ed

AFC Eddie  Once a MOD file is unpacked with Agate, is a file type change
           needed?

AFA Gene   Nope, since all that NT looks for is the ""MOD."" being the first
           four characters in the filename.

AFC Eddie  OK, Thanks!

Deanna7332 Question...

JonL7      Can you list some of the features of Noisetracker?

AFA Gene   (you don't even need that ""MOD."" if you want to type the name in
           directly.)

Deanna7332 Did any of these mod files have anything to do with FTA's ""Module
           A""

AFA Gene   Sure Jon, right after we answer Deanna's question. Deanna, you
           mean ""Modulae?""

Deanna7332 Yes, that's it.

AFA Gene   Modulae was a demo written by FTA last year. (i'll get to you in a
           sec Doors).  It used SoundSmith v0.95 for all it's music. There
           is no connection between MOD files and Modulae by FTA.

Deanna7332 Throughout the demo it said ""Loading modules""

AFA Gene   Those ""modules"" are not the same as Amiga soundfile ""modules"" --
           you see, what Modulae really was was a ""stringing together"" of a
           bunch of neat little tiny demos that FTA had written. So they
           called each little demo a ""module"" and thus the entire demo as a
           whole, ""Modulae"" (fancy plural of module?)

Deanna7332 Ok I understand.  Thank you. :)

AFL JoyceM Latin, Gene :)

AFA Gene   The term ""MODule"" from the Amiga comes from the idea that all the
           stuff needed to play the songfile (all the instruments + the
           sequence file) are included into one file, the ""module.""

TheDoors1  Gene, I have tried to d/l some recent uploaded MODs in the PC
           music area and still the problem exists.

AFA Gene   As I understand it, the problem was fixed VERY recently (correct
           me on this Joyce) and files uploaded as recently as early
           November still might not work depending on the version of the
           PCAO software that the uploader used.

AFL JoyceM Actually, Gene...I was under the impression that it had been, but
           if Doors is still having a problem, then it must not be fixed.

AFA Gene   What date was the file you tried to d/l, Door?

TheDoors1  umm 11/17, around there

AFA Gene   hmmm.... well i can tell you one thing... if it didn't work, don't
           waste your time again later... the problem is in the Apple
           software's method of d/lling files, and there are no plans to
           upgrade the Apple AO software.

AFL JoyceM I will endeavor to get an answer to that PC downloading
           problem/question :)

ThomasK63  i have a quick question... what can you use to unpack amiga mod
           files? On the PC side, that is.

TheDoors1  Agate Thomas

ELECTMUSIC Doors... what happens on after downloading..

Deanna7332 If it's LZHed you can't unless you have an IBM or
           PC/Transporter.

AFA Gene   If GS-ShrinkIt doesn't have that ability, i don't think there
           exists any such utility on the GS.

TheDoors1  What do you mean Elect?

ELECTMUSIC After you download the file... where do you encounter a problem?

TheDoors1  ok, you know when you download the file and at some point in the
           download the file starts to appear on your screen.  That's when I
           cancel it.

ThomasK63  I am sure soething good can be made w/out resorting to Amiga
           files

AFC Eddie  Yes, Doors, I believe the problem is with the PC software it was
           UL'd with.

TheDoors1  yeah Eddie.

GNO Tim    Amiga MOD files are typically compressed using LHarc.  I've
           uncompressed several on my Unix machine at school.

ThomasK63  good time for someone to make a lharc unpacker...

AFC DYAJim someone might be ;)

GNO Tim    Several people are already

AFC Eddie  Can't wait, Jim!

AFA Gene   Jon, did you have a question?

JonL7      The features of Noisetracker :)

AFA Gene   Oh yes... okay, here goes, in a nutshell, from most important to
           least:


AFA Gene   *  ability to import MOD files

           *  ability to import Soundsmith files

           *  ProDOS 8 based

           *  virtually no editing abilities (not a feature but important to
           know)

AFC DYAJim :)

AFA Gene   *  forgot: and the most important feature of all, the ability to
           hold instrument files in regular system RAM instead of DOC RAM,
           allowing for instruments far beyond the regular 64K limit found
           in ALL other GS music programs.

ThomasK63  I'll buy that!

TheDoors1  I have another question...when you're ready.

AFA Gene   GA Doors

TheDoors1  ok..is it true that NoiseTracker will take in soundsmith files and
           play them more clearly

AFA Gene   Well, as far as ""what you hear,"" yes there is a definite
           difference with some instruments. It does NOT play the sounds
           more ""clearly,"" but it just plays them in a different way. What
           many people seem to like about this ""different way"" is that
           sustained instruments (i.e. instruments designed to be played
           in a loop to simulate a long held note) seem to work better (or
           perhaps simply the way they were originally intended to work).

TheDoors1  I see

Deanna7332 Which takes up more space - MOD or NT  w/soundfile ?

AFA Gene   Deanna, it depends a few things, such as how big the sequence is,
           how many instruments you have, etc. Once you have a lot of
           assorted files, it'll probably average out to be about the same
           give or take a hundred blocks on your HD. So it basically depends
           on whether you prefer to have your instruments separate or not.

Deanna7332 Does playing quality differ with either one ?

AFA Gene   Nope. It's exactly the same either way. Loading time is the same
           too.

AFC Eddie  Can NT save songs as MOD files?

AFA Gene   Nope. It has options for Open and Close module, but these are
           still inactive.

AFA Gene   If there are no more questions, I'd like to talk about which NT
           files out there are the ""hottest,"" since this info could be
           useful to many users who are interested in downloading NT/MOD
           files.

           My personal favorite is ""Lambada,"" which is supplied by FTA with
           the program but is available separately on America
           Online.Everything about this file is really impressive except
           perhaps the sound quality of the horn-ish melody instrument.

           What about y'all, what are your favorite NT files?

AFL JoyceM Gene, there is a classical song for NT, but can't remember the
           name, but it is good.

AFC Eddie  I like Dragnet!

ELECTMUSIC So do I Ed

TheDoors1  I like Seven something

Deanna7332 My most favorite of all mod files is Pleasure Principle

AFC Eddie  <--appreciate's Greg's taste!

AFL JoyceM :)

AFA Gene   Deanna, i assume you got that from a local board?

Deanna7332 I got it from the PC forum here.

TheDoors1  I saw it there also

Deanna7332 I think under ""Pleasure""

AFA Gene   Would you be able to upload it here? If it's really that good, we
           ought to have it available directly in our oun NT lib here (BTW
           folks, we will be releasing a new NoiseTracker software library
           soon!)

AFC Eddie  What a Forum!!!

Deanna7332 That sounds great!

AFL JoyceM Gene, do you think it will be possible for synthLAB files to be
           converted to MOD files?

AFL JoyceM MOD files?

AFA Gene   I doubt it, Joyce. The formats are so diametrically opposed in
           their entire basis of their file formats that it wouldn't be
           worth the time for a programmer to develop such a convertor.

Deanna7332 Isn't it possible to move the mod file from the PC forum to our
           music library?

AFA Gene   But..... it might be worth the time for a MIDI File Format to MOD
           convertor, since these two formats are more widely accepted.

Nuzz       they have nothing better to do Gene

ELECTMUSIC Gene.. some interesting similarities with DTune and NTracker

AFA Gene   They lose the file, tho, Deanna. :)

AFL JoyceM In what way, Greg?

ELECTMUSIC Both Prodos 8

Deanna7332 Shhh they won't know a thing :)

ELECTMUSIC I also believe Bill uses a shuttling of sound data between Doc
           Ram and Ram.

AFC Eddie  Interesting, Greg.

ELECTMUSIC Thats how he gets some of the excellent instrument quality

AFC Eddie  But Diversitune has that one distinction:  MIDI input.

AFL JoyceM Deanna, we would greatly appreciate it if you would upload that
           'Pleasure' song to our library :)

ELECTMUSIC Agreed Ed.. one of the factors FTA doesn't like to incorporate
           into their programs.

Deanna7332 I'll u/l it tonight if possible.

AFL JoyceM Thanks :)

AFC Eddie  Thanks, Deanna!

AFL JoyceM I will send Bill B a copy of NoiseTracker + some MOD files...to
           see what comments we get from him (will send when I get back).

AFC DYAJim What ever happened to that diversitune upgrade that was talked
           about ?

ELECTMUSIC That would be interesting Joyce

AFC Eddie  Bill apparently still working on it, Jim.

ELECTMUSIC I am sure he would appreciate the Prodos 8

AFC DYAJim good..

AFL JoyceM Jim...RSN....he was hoping by Christmas (this year), but he is
           soooo busy with his job, who knows?

AFC DYAJim Oh yeah, I noticed the speed calcuation in NT .5 is inaccurate
           :)

AFC DYAJim I recall he has set a lot of Christmas projected dates :)

ELECTMUSIC He was one of the first ""Free Tools"" experts in breaking all the
           rules for economic sake.

AFC DYAJim like for the vaporware DT inst editor like 2 years ago.

Deanna7332 Are there any Christmas Mod or NT songs?

AFC Eddie  Oh yeah, Diversi-Editor!

AFL JoyceM I know, Jim - but that I know he has been working on.

AFC DYAJim he projected Christmas for it, and it never came :)

AFA Gene   Not yet in AMS, but hopefully the Holiday Contest will change all
           that. :)

AFC DYAJim I look foreward to any upgrades..

AFL JoyceM Not that I am aware of Deanna - you have some?  hint, hint

Deanna7332 Nope sorry.  I was hoping there were some that could be u/led
           here

AFC DYAJim I'll be breaking out the xmas tune book rsn.. I should be able to
           midi a few :) (which rules out nt)

AFL JoyceM Question...

AFC Eddie  It would be more appropriate to have a converter from Appleworks
           spreadsheet to MOD than from MIDI!

AFL JoyceM If I got ahold of an Amiga song (MOD) disk...how would I convert
           them for here?

AFA Gene   You mean an Amiga-formatted disk?

AFL JoyceM Yes

AFC DYAJim Ack.. methinks you need an amiga and a null modem cable or a
           modem.

AFA Gene   Methinks Jim is right

AFC DYAJim LOL!!  Design your music in the spreadsheet then import to NT :)
           IT might actually have better editing?!! :)

AFC Eddie  Right!

AFL JoyceM Me thinks he is right.  If I had them upload to me, would that
           work?

AFA Gene   Yep; should work like a charm.

AFC DYAJim Yah.. as long as they're coming from an amiga

AFL JoyceM Great....I will work on that when I get back  (making note now).

AFL JoyceM Gene, will you get some of those files (NT) sent to that area
           tonight?  If so, I will leave the needed message :)

AFA Gene   That's all I have planned for tonight's chat, Joyce. Yep, I'll
           move some files right now.

AFL JoyceM Thanks...

AFL JoyceM Then we should have our NoiseTracker Library by end of the week in
           AMS :)

ELECTMUSIC Gene... quick question:  Are you launching NTracker from a 3.5
           disk?

AFL JoyceM Okay, guys...I will see you all the week of December 11th (may the
           4th) as I am off on vacation.

AFA Gene   Yep greg

AFC JohnC  Where are you going?

ELECTMUSIC Do you encounter out of memory problems

AFL JoyceM Night all...and Gene, thanks for an excellent chat and great
           explanations of NoiseTracker.

Nuzz       Joyce, I have good news for FutureSound owners. SoundConvert will
           support it in the first release

AFC Eddie  Great, Mike!

AFA Gene   Greg, i always keep my RAMdisk at 0 when using noisetracker. Not
           only are

AFC JohnC  Mike...SoundConvert...released?

AFL JoyceM Great, Mike.  When can we get SoundConvert, Mike? and FutureSound
           :)

AFA Gene   there a couple of bugs with memory management, but if you're
           loading in a MOD file that's really big, NT will eat your RAMdisk.

AFC Eddie  Sounds good.

Nuzz       The manual is being ""layout"". Release date should be about 1st
           week of Dec

ELECTMUSIC Tnxs Gene

AFC JohnC  YES.......WTG Nuzz!!!!!!!!

Deanna7332 Yes, why is there on some MOD files a stop somewhere in the middle
           ?

Deanna7332 That's really frustrating!

AFL JoyceM Mike, leave me E-Mail on when and how I can send your the $$ to
           get it.

AFL JoyceM Again...night all

Nuzz       gee John, I had to do something to explain the delay :)

ELECTMUSIC Thanks Gene for a GREAT chat!

AFC Eddie  Yes, Gene!  Great!

AFA Gene   Thanks Greg, 'night!

AFA Gene   thanx, see y'all later :)

Copyright 1987 Bob Szekely.

    John Michael Osbourne, (known as ""Ozzy"" to his fans), has in his long 
career as vocalist for Black Sabbath had his work with the group misconstrued 
as advocating Satanism.  In a 1983 radio special featuring Ozzy, the 
interviewer expressed precisely this point; ""...Ozzy has always been shrouded 
in the darkest of Satanic imagery.  Yet if you really listen to his music, 
you'll find that what he is saying differs greatly from his image....""(1)  Even 
the group's image has often been described as ""occult and diabolic"".(2)

    The important point to remember here is to differentiate between appearance 
and reality.  Although the name ""Black Sabbath"" conjures up images of witches 
and sorcerers paying homage to Satan for the powers bestowed upon them, this 
does not make it safe to assume that the group that went by this name 
necessarily drew the inspiration from the occult.(3)  The closest they ever 
came to it was a gothic horror film featuring Boris Karloff as narrator; they 
adopted their name directly from the name of this film.(4)  Black Sabbath was 
involved in the black arts as much as Karloff practiced casting spells off-
screen.  Tony Iommi, the group's guitarist, summed it up best when he described 
the group as having basically ""...the same appeal as a horror movie.  It's all 
an act.""(5)










    Just as their film counterpart did, Ozzy and Sabbath found the occult 
mythos to be an effective vehicle for powerful social commentary; particularly 
when put in the context of heavy-metal rock and roll.  Ozzy himself noted that 
there are ""...people who pick up my [album] cover[s] and go...'This guy's got 
to be singing about Devil, doom, death and destruction.'  Which is not the 
case....""(6)

    The late Lester Bangs likened the group to Bob Dylan and William Burroughs, 
describing them all as ""...moralists...trying to deal with a serious present 
situation in an honest way....""(7)  Ozzy and Black Sabbath merely bring to 
light the many evils of our world in their work, to try and make us realize 
that we are all victim to their influence.  They hope to make us recognize 
these evils so that we may take up arms against them; a point Ozzy emphatically 
stresses:  ""...one thing everybody has got to understand about Black Sabbath's 
lyrics.  They're not downer lyrics, they're just telling everybody where it's 
at...""(8)  He also cites the group's most controversial tune, ""Black Sabbath"", 
as a response to the ignorant hippie culture still force when the tune was 
written in 1970:  ""The hippies said: 'The world is beautiful man.' (sic)  You 
only had to look around you to see how crappy it was.  It was ridiculous 
listening to that stuff, let alone playing it, so we just wrote about the world 
the way it really was and how it affected us - and we felt better in ourselves 
because we were really being honest....""(9)

    I   1   HAVE YOU EVER THOUGH ABOUT YOUR SOUL-
        2   CAN IT BE SAVED?
        3   OR PERHAPS YOU THINK THAT WHEN YOU ARE DEAD
        4   YOU JUST STAY IN YOUR GRAVE.
        5   IS GOD JUST A THOUGHT WITHIN YOUR HEAD OR IS
        6   HE A PART OF YOU?
        7   IS CHRIST JUST A NAME THAT YOU READ IN A BOOK
        8   WHEN YOU WERE AT SCHOOL?

    II  9   WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT DEATH DO YOU LOSE
        10  YOUR BREATH OR DO YOU KEEP YOUR COOL?
        11  WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE THE POPE ON THE END

        13  WELL I'VE SEEN THE TRUTH - YES I'VE SEEN 
        14  THE LIGHT AND I'VE CHANGED MY WAYS.
        15  AND I'LL BE PREPARED WHEN YOU'RE LONELY

        18  FRIENDS MIGHT SAY 
        19  IF THEY NEW YOU BELIEVED IN GOD ABOVE
        20  THEY SHOULD REALISE BEFORE THE CRITICISE
        21  THAT GOD IS THE ONLY WAY TO LOVE.

    IV  23  IS YOUR MIND SO SMALL THAT YOU HAVE TO FALL
        24 IN WITH THE PACK WHEREVER THEY RUN

        32  SAY YOU DON'T BELIEVE?
        33  YOU HAD THE CHANCE BUT YOU TURNED IT DOWN
        34  NOW YOU CAN'T RETRIEVE.










    VI  35  PERHAPS YOU'LL THINK BEFORE YOU SAY THAT
        36  GOD IS DEAD AND GONE
        37  OPEN YOUR EYES, JUST REALIZE THAT HE IS THE
        38  ONE.
        39  THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN SAVE YOU KNOW FROM
        40  ALL THIS SIN AND HATE.
        41  OR WILL YOU STILL JEER AT ALL YOU HEAR?
        42  YES!-I THINK IT'S TOO LATE.

    In this piece, the group asserts a belief in an afterlife and spiritual 
redemption.  As grisly as the image of a hanged pontiff is, its shock value is 
a necessary part of the message:  They reject religious dogma, stating that a 
belief in God, in one's own heart, is the only guiding light to help one inn 
his life (lines 11/12, 39/40).  Furthermore, the reject religious hypocrisy 
(lines 5/6, 7/8) and peer pressure (verses III, IV) as excuses for not 
accepting God.  To clarify further:  following the crowd does not justify 
shrugging responsibility for one's own actions.

    After re-reading, it becomes obvious that this song is an ascerbic critique 
of atheism; (line 35/36) I refer here again to verses three and four.  In these 
two verses, the picture painted in one of Godless conformity and how it's 
viewed as being as foolish as Paganism.  These lyrics set an example for the 
listener by relating personal experience (lines 13-16).  However, for those who 
cannot accept this the group has no recourse but to condemn them, although 
rather ironically; they hope that their rhetorical loss of faith in the 
listener will open his eyes (line 42).










                           B L A C K   S A B B A T H 



            WHAT IS THIS, THAT STANDS BEFORE ME?
            FIGURE IN BLACK, WHICH POINTS AT ME
            TURN ROUND QUICK AND START TO RUN
            FIND OUT I'M THE CHOSEN ONE.  OH, NO!
            
            BIG BLACK SHAPE WITH EYES OF FIRE
            TELLING PEOPLE THEIR DESIRE
            SATAN'S SITTING THERE, HE'S SMILING
            WATCHES THOSE FLAMES GET HIGHER AND HIGHER
            OH, NO, NO, -- PLEASE GOD HELP ME!
            
                IS THIS THE END MY FRIEND?
                SATAN'S COMING 'ROUND THE BEND
                PEOPLE RUNNING 'CAUSE THEY'RE SCARED
                THE PEOPLE BETTER GO AND BEWARE
                NO, NO!  PLEASE--NO!!
                
                
    The all time controversy winner!  Is this not irrefutably  THE song about 
Black Magic in rock?  It's all so obvious, suffuse with evil imagery; Satan, 
walls of flame, figure in black, and damnation at the end.  Yes, I see the 
images too; it definitely concerns Black Magic.  Then again, Shakespeare's 
Macbeth employed scenes of witches involved in conjurations; does that mean 
that Shakespeare was a warlock?  Poe used to write sardonic tragedies about 
twisted murderers and the bizarre nature of acts, did that make him an evil, 
leering, demented killer?  Did either of them advocated what they wrote about?  
One has to remember that writing about something is not necessarily the same as 
emulating it.  Tony Iommi spoke out quite strongly about this:  ""People are 
bringing us down saying that we are a Black Magic group.  I think they must be










getting mixed up with Black Widow.  We don't do any sacrifices on stage, and 
we're not on a black magic kick.  We wanted to do heavy numbers and the guitar 
riffs we worked out were more suited to evil things than love.  We play songs 
about black magic, but they are more likely to be against than for it.""(12)  

    By now, you're probably asking yourself who Black Widow is, right?  Then 
it's time for a little history:

        Sabbath, before they were known as Sabbath, had the same line-up but 
two earlier names.  The first one was Polka Tulk, which seemed sure to doom 
them to obscurity.(13)  The soon realized this and changed the group's name to 
Earth.  Now, Earth was a blues band at the end of the English blues boom.  As 
if that wasn't bad enough, they soon discovered that not only was there another 
group named Earth, but they had also released a single.  To avoid confusion, 
they changed their name again.(14)  But what made them decide on that name?  
Just ask Ozzy:  ""I just liked the name Black Sabbath because of the succession 
of vowel sounds.(15)  If that sounds ludicrous just consider this:  Sabbath was 
""...the first of the really committed, loud and heavy bands...""(16)  They 
needed a name to match the gut-wrenching power they were developing.  Tony knew 
that he wanted Sabbath to be noticed above all the rest of the British blues 
bands:  ""We wanted something of our own that we'd like and people would like.  
And we wanted something loud!""










    Tony didn't hate the blues.  He'd cut his teeth as a guitarist on the likes 
of The Shadows, Buddy Holly and Django Rheinhardt, developing his own style 
from there.  But he realized the group had no future in the blues:

        'We couldn't keep playing 12-bars forever.  We just got fed up with 
Earth music.  It was jazz, blues stuff.  It was good for practice but nothing 
else.'

    In the late 'Sixties, blues groups were a dime a dozen in Birmingham and 
interest was waning in the blues boom due to the glut of groups.  One man, by 
the name of Jim Simpson, had heard Earth around the Birmingham club circuit and 
understood what they were trying to do.  He decided to take them under his 
wing.  With the aid of his massive record collection, Jim expanded the group's 
horizons in the areas of jazz and blues.  He introduced them to artists like 
Wes Montgomery, Count Basie and Jimmy Rushing.  It was from Rushing in 
particular that they derived the repetitive riff style so readily noticeable in 
their later incarnation as Black Sabbath.

    The Count Basie influence is evidenced in the song ""Wicked World"" from the 
first album; Sabbath drummer Bill Ward uses a ""'sighing hi-hat'...in the manner 
of Basie's drummer Jo Jones.""










    The influence is subtle, almost subliminal.  Yet it is one which was not 
thought capable of hard, 'heavy' rock bands in the late 'Sixties.  Although Led 
Zeppelin and Jimi Hendrix also had their work steeped in blues and jazz 
derivations (Hendrix' ""Third Stone From the Sun"" and Zeppelin's version of 
Willie Dixon's ""I Can't Quit You Baby"" from their first album), neither was 
able to match the intense energy of Black Sabbath.  Iommi has always had a 
preference for music with an original, distinct style of its' own; as an 
example, he mentions guitarists Joe Pass and Alvin Lee as two of his strongest 
songwriting influences.

    It would also be necessary that Sabbath develop a unique, distinctive style 
and image of their own.  Though they had changed their name from Earth to Black 
Sabbath to avoid confusion with the other Earth; at the same time another group 
emerged by the name of Black Widow ""...who WERE profoundly influenced by the 
occult, had a male witch as a patron, and wrote pieces like ""Come to The 
Sabbat.""  Unfortunately, Sabbath was constantly reaping the benefits of Widow's 
publicity.

    Sabbath was a group that never minced words.  If they saw something as 
destructive, they would be sure to rub the listener's face it it.  They did not 
want their point to be missed.

    With their straightforward, sometimes brutal way of looking at things, they 
try to shock the listener's conscience back into awareness.  The imagery of 
""Hand of Doom"", from the Paranoid album, is candid and condemning; it is a 
strong statement against drug addiction and rightly so...

    Many people felt the group's overall direction was pessimistic and had a 
negative effect on its listener's due to that.  ""Ozzy insisted that if people 
thought he was having a bad effect on the minds of young kids, they should go 
and watch the TV news where real murder and mayhem were a way of life, and 
shown night after night."" (18)

    Sabbath was never negative in their message; they were simply truthful 
about waht they saw as wrong in the world.  If you ""Strip away the horror 
stories, the imagery and the hysteria, (and) turn down the amps a notch...you 
have a well-rehearsed, solid blues and rock band, powered by a dedication to 
well defined objectives.""  On the top of the list of those objectives was 
truth; Sabbath never feared facing that truth squarely, regardless of what many 
people thought of them.

Long, long, time ago,
I can still remember,
When the local calls were ""free"".
And I knew if I paid my bill,
And never wished them any ill,
That the phone company would let me be...

But Uncle Sam said he knew better,
Split 'em up, for all and ever!
We'll foster competition:
It's good capital-ism!

I can't remember if I cried,
When my phone bill first tripled in size.
But something touched me deep inside,
The day... Bell System... died.

And we were singing...

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

Is your office Step by Step,
Or have you gotten some Crossbar yet?
Everybody used to ask...
Oh, is TSPS coming soon?
IDDD will be a boon!
And, I hope to get a Touch-Tone phone, real soon...

The color phones are really neat,
And direct dialing can't be beat!
My area code is ""low"":
The prestige way to go!

Oh, they just raised phone booths to a dime!
Well, I suppose it's about time.
I remember how the payphones chimed,
The day... Bell System... died.

And we were singing...

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

Back then we were all at one rate,
Phone installs didn't cause debate,
About who'd put which wire where...
Installers came right out to you,
No ""phone stores"" with their ballyhoo,
And 411 was free, seemed very fair!

But FCC wanted it seems,
To let others skim long-distance creams,
No matter 'bout the locals,
They're mostly all just yokels!

And so one day it came to pass,
That the great Bell System did collapse,
In rubble now, we all do mass,
The day... Bell System... died.

So bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

I drove on out to Murray Hill,
To see Bell Labs, some time to kill,
But the sign there said the Labs were gone.
I went back to my old CO,
Where I'd had my phone lines, years ago,
But it was empty, dark, and ever so forlorn...

No relays pulsed,
No data crooned,
No MF tones did play their tunes,
There wasn't a word spoken,
All carrier paths were broken...

And so that's how it all occurred,
Microwave horns just nests for birds,
Everything became so absurd,
The day... Bell System... died.

So bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

We were singing:

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?

'Cause she's good enough for me!      With her pagan poetry!

Shall we sing a verse for Venus,    Well the Christians all are humming
Of the Gods she is the meanest,     Cause they say their God is coming,

And it's good enough for me.        And that's good enough for me.

Rites by carrying a part out             He's just itching to unwrap us.

But it's good enough for me!             And that's good enough for me!)

We will all bow down to Allah     Where's the gong gone? I can't find it

I was singing Hari Rama              We will pray with those Egyptians
With my friend the Dalai Lama        Build pyramids to put our crypts in

But that's good enough for me        which is good enough for me.....!

One-eyed Odin we will follow      We will pray to Zarathustra

Hare Krishna gets a laugh on         I'll arise at early mornin'

We will venerate Bubastis            Call Him God, or call him Allah

but She's good enough for me!        And that's good enough for me!       
 
And what about this Bacchus,         Diana is a little spikey
Who lives just to raise a ruckus?    And she is a little dyke-ey
Loosens women so they'll f*** us,    You don't have to be a Psych-e
Well, that's good enough for me!     To know that's right for me!

Lilith wears a lacy nightie        That Bob Larson shrieks and hollers
And She is a little flighty        Fighting demons in his callers
She will get you all excite-y      Save his program: SEND YOUR DOLLARS! 
She's wet-dream enough for me!     And that's good enough for me.

                      (Tune: ""Lily the Pink"")

   Now here's a story, a little bit gory,
   A little bit happy, a little bit sad.
   About a drink called Imperium Compound
   And how the SCA's been had!                       (1)

   Chorus: Oh we think, we think, we think,

           Rules the Kingdom thru Imperium Compound
           The results are plain to see!

   All the Crusadenes were big, but not mean,
   And the finest fighters in the town.
   But they all drank Jerusalem Compound,
   Winning Crown after Crown after Crown!                   (5)

   Good Duke Arthur couldn't get no farth-er
   A Norman King in Aten Land
   Drank too much of Imperium Compound
   And went off to conquer Engel-land!                      (5)

   Then King Richard, a bit of a bitch, heard
   A King's Crown could be done.
   Drank a little Imperium Compound
   And became the Aten King, first one!                     (5)

   There was Astra, no one ever asked her
   And she was for having fun!
   Then she sampled Imperium Compound,
   And today she is a nun   \\ not better!\\               (19)

   There's good old Igor, his prowess is meager
   For he never learned to water-ski!
   But instead he drinks Imperium Compound
   Then he howls and climbs a tree!  \\Hoo Hah!\\          (19)

   Then there's Dagan, his brother's the Ka-Khan,
   Which is quite funny in a King!
   If he gets hooked on Imperium Compound
   There'll be new songs to sing!    \\ Oh, really?\\       (19)  

   Fredrick of Holland, who dwells in the Northland,
   A Master from the West, he came!
   Spends all his money for Imperium Compound
   That's why his garb's always the same!                   (20)

   Now Gyrth Oldcastle, round as a beer barrel,
   Once chose to quarrel with a certain Bard;
   The poet served him with Imperium Compound,
   And left him rendered down to lard!                      (20)

   Many tales abound of Imperium Compound
   And its' strange effects on Royalty,
   But after an hour, this song has no power,
   And by now, it's boring ME!                             (16)

   Duchess Malinda, who doesn't do windas
   But she does a lot of Duchess Things,
   But give her a LOT of Imperium Compound,
   And she sings and sings and sings and sings and sings!   (5)

   AltChorus: Oh it's too long, too long, too long
              To sing the whole song, the song, the song
              Longer than a Royal Court, it is!
              But sing it serial, this ditty Imperial
              And you'll be a bardic whiz!                 (5)

                                             IMPERIUM COMPOUND    
                                             (Atenveldt Verses)

   Now here's a story, a little bit gory,
   A little bit happy, a little bit sad.
   About a drink called Imperium Compound
   And how the SCA's been had!                       

   Chorus: Oh we think, we think, we think,
           The King is a fink, a fink, a fink,
           A figure of respectability
           Rules the Kingdom thru Imperium Compound
           The results are plain to see!

   Mongol Hordemen, those free-living swordsmen
   Subverting the Kingdoms from underneath!
   Have no use for Imperium Compound
   Except perhaps to brush their teeth!

   AltChorus: Oh we fink, we fink, we fink,
              The Khan and the Kink, the Kink, the Kink,
              And the Board, their Great Senilities!
              The Western Irgun, drinks Imperium Compound
              And we're BACK, with results you'll see!    

   Lady Laurel, with Authority Royal,
   Passes and rejects our heraldry
   She needs a swig of Imperium Compound
   Then perhaps she'd deign to talk to me!            

   Lady Trude thought it her duty
   To turn a social wrong into a Right
   Proved her point with Imperium Compound
   And showed that Cheshire Cats can fight!  //and scratch//

   The Board of Directors styled themselves The Electors
   And another con they tried to swing
   Now the BoD drinks Imperium Compound
   So we no longer need a King!                        

   AltChorus: Oh the Bod, the BoD, the BoD,
              It thinks it is God, is God, is God,
              The figure of Supreme Authority!
              And if we O.D.'d on Imperium Compund
              there'd be no need for Royalty!          

   Oh, MEDIEVAL Net, we thought it was all wet
   With witty remarks, and other kinds of sass
   We'll feed our computers on Imperium Compound
   And BYTE the BoD right on its' righteous ass!         

   Good old Duncan was often drunken
   Chasing all the ladies fair
   He bathed himself in Imperium Compound
   Now he has a little savoir faire!                     

                    (more)


  ATEN IMPERIUM (cont.)

   Ioseph of Locksley, never changes his socks, he
   Runs around looking like a Cavalier,
   He stocked up on Imperium Compound
   And he has enough to last for years and years!        

   AltChorus: Oh they forgot, forgot, forgot
              The Locks-e-ly Plot, the Plot, the Plot!
              And it works the best when it is underground!
              It isn't a hassle for a green-and-white tassle
              They're the ones that BREW Imperium Compound!  

   Trelon of the Wood, he was very good, he
   Was a leader that had never been beat before;
   But Caid had Imperium Compound,
   And Imperial Roman Caid won the War!  //with help!//   

   In Tyr Ysgithr, it's regularly whispered there
   That the Kingdom is ruled over by a King    // What's THAT? //
   They're ""democratic"" and quite erratic....
   They've forgot the purpose of the whole damn thing!     

   King Sir Mark von, with his pretty white suit on,
   Rules the Kingdom both with Grace and Purity!
   He never touches Imperium Compound
   At least not where anyone else can see!               

   Duke Sir Deaton, was never beaten
   On the field, or in the drinking hall;
   At the Catbox War with Caid,
   Left thirty bodies piled against the wall!             

   Denis O'Titans was good at smitin'
   A Locksley Monster in every single way!
   Drank a little Imperium Compound
   And ATE Deaton's sword that day  // No! REALLY! //       

   Wotan the Mongoloid, a little bit paranoid,
   But a nice guy none the less;
   Drank a mess of Imperium Compound
   Now he's Justin du Roc, I confess!                       

   Then there's Duke Reynard, with a face like a St. Bernard
   Of the Dukes, he is the homliest
   He tends to toke up on Imperium Compound
   And go out and whomp on anybody's best!                   

   This song'll bedevil the folks at a revel,
   And most of the time it will annoy the King,
   So take a drink of Imperium Compound
   And let's go Royalty-bedeviling!                        

   Duchess Anna is quite a fan-a
   Going on a wartime shopping spree!  \\ War Point!\\
   Took a drink of Imperium Compound
   And shopped so fast we couldn't see! \\ Z-o-o-o-om!\\    (5)

                     (more)


  ATEN IMPERIUM (Cont.)

   Lyn of Whitewolfe, made of the right stuff,
   Twice the Queen of Atenveldt;
   Took a drink of Imperium Compound
   And the Kingdom of Caid before her knelt!              

   Duke Sir Brion, and Duke Sir Trelon,
   Won the Crown with regularity;
   Drank a lot of Imperium Compound,
   And founded a dynasty!                                 

   Stephan von Geist, was most awful nice,
   And a chivalrous fighter without any doubt
   Took a swig of Imperium Compound
   And won the Crown his first time out!                    

   All the Crusadenes were big, but not mean,
   And the finest fighters in the town.
   But they all drank Jerusalem Compound,
   Winning Crown after Crown after Crown!                 

   Good Duke Arthur couldn't get no farth-er
   A Norman King in Aten Land
   Drank too much of Imperium Compound
   And went off to conquer Engel-land!                    

   Then King Richard, a bit of a bitch, heard
   A King's Crown could be done.
   Drank a little Imperium Compound
   And became the Aten King, first one!                    

   Duchess Malinda, who doesn't do windas,
   But she does a lot of Duchess Things,
   But give her a LOT of Imperium Compound,
   And she sings and sings and sings and sings and sings!   

   Duke Sir Brion, with his pretty white suit on,
   Is a model of goodness and purity
   Never touches Imperium Compound
(spoken:) And I'll sell ya seashore property in Yuma, too!  

   Optional last verse:

   Many tales abound of Imperium Compound
   And its' strange effects on Royalty,
   But after an hour, this song has no power,
   And by now, it's boring ME!                            

   AltChorus: Oh it's too long, too long, too long
              To sing the whole song, the song, the song
              Longer than a Royal Court, it is!
              But sing it serial, this ditty Imperial
              And you'll be a bardic whiz!

                recorded: CELTIC CIRCLE DANCE
                          WTP-0002C

        Last night I had the strangest dream in this bleak century
        I dreamed that people the world around believed in Chivalry

        I dreamed I saw a Kingly Crown enshrined in laurel leaves
        with Grace and Joy and Purity attendant at his feet

        I dreamed I saw the perfect Knight receive his accolade
        and minstrels sang and children laughed in some soft forest glade

        I dreamed I saw the finest thing that ever man could make
        grow great and strong and undefiled: Pray God I never wake!

        Last night I had the strangest dream in this bleak century
        I dreamed that people the world around believed in Chivalry

               (to the tune of ""Good King Wenceslaus"")

                Locksley Monsters never yield
                on the field of battle
                strike the helm and bash the shield
                make their eyeteeth rattle
                Bodies on the ground will lie
                bones will burst in sunder
                search for Locksleys' enemies:
                You'll find them six feet under!

                              SONG OF IVANOF

            There is a man who we know well that does the best he can
            but he's displayed in armour made of reticulated garbage cans!

            He looks so fine and fair and strong, oh how he plays the man
            and how it's prized, those galvanized, reticulated garbage cans

            The noblest Roman of them all, a good Praetorian
            a combatant who wears no pants, judst reticulated garbage cans!

            Like old Horatius at the Bridge, like the Legions of Valerian
            (O dearie me: those LOVELY knees!)
            and those reticulated garbage cans!

                         C. McCray Bethancourt

         (sung to the tune (obviously) of the 12 Days of Christmas)


1.           The first time I sent my device, The Heralds said to me

            ""It violates the Rule of Three""

2.           The next time I tried it, the Heralds said to me

            ""We changed the forms, and it violates the Rule of
             Three"".

3.           The third time I tried, and the Heralds said to me, 

            ""We upped the fees, we changed the forms, and it
             violates the Rule of Three"".

4.           Another time I tried and the Heralds said to me,
 
            ""We haven't got it, we upped the fees, we changed the 
             forms, and it violates the Rule of Three"".

5.           The fifth time I tried it, the Heralds said to me,  

            ""In a decision rendered by the College of Arms on
             August 1st, A.S. V it was decided that this style of
             heraldic design was not appropriate to the aims and 
             intentions of the Corporate Body. Holy! Holy! Holy! ""

 note: verse 5 is delivered in an extremely fast, mono-
       tone, similiar to a Gregorian Chant.

           "" ....we haven't got it, we upped the fees, we changed the forms,
             and it violates the Rule of Three.""

6.           I tried it a sixth time, and the Heralds said to me,

            ""We changed the rules, &c""

7.           A seventh time I tried and, the Heralds said to me,

            ""It's against the Rule of Tincture, we changed the
             rules, &c""

8.           I tried it once again and the heralds said to me,

            ""It's not a Period design, It's against the Rule of Tincture, We
             changed the rules, &c""

                                * more *



    Heralds Said To Me (cont.)

9.           I sent it in once more, and the Heralds said to me,

            ""We changed the rules again, It's not a Period design,
             it's against the Rule of Tincture, we changed the
             rules, &c""

10. (sung in cold anger)
             The LAST time I sent my device, the Heralds said to me

    (sung in a state of SMUG)
             ""Someone else has got it, &c""




              (nb: every single one of these reasons has been used by the
              CoA, at one point or another, to reject perfectly good
              heraldry, along with some even MORE stupid.  If the shoe 
              fits....................!!!!!!!!)

                        BUGS ON THE BARONESS
                        Tune: Waltzing Matilda
 
           or: Who was that Vermin I saw you with last, Knight?
   or: There may be Lice on all you Knice, but there ain't no Lice on me

           Once there was a Barony howling in the wilderness
           nestled in the Valley where the River doesn't flow
           and the folks were driven buggy by the insects in the Revel Hall
           Authenticity is wonderful, but this doesn't go!

                   Bugs on the Baroness, bugs on the Baroness!
                   That was the cry that you heard all the day
                   and the scratching can be heard from Ysgithr to Ered Sul
                   why did we come here? Let's go away!

           See them all a scratching, nestled in their armour tight
           the fleas have a melee team that's challenging the field!
           call Truly Nolen! Someone's gotta help us out!
           the crabs are nesting in our helms but we'll never yield!

                   (chorus)

           Dawn comes a-breaking, the bugs have won the Coronet...
           flea-infested Conan-clones in piles upon the lawn
           where is the Barony? The bugs have eaten everyone...
           termites got the stick-jocks, and all their sticks are gone!

                   (chorus)

                          ATENVELDT
                          tune: The West's Awake

                  For all the Lands where I have dwelt
                  Oh Atenveldt, Oh Atenveldt
                  till rivers burn and mountains melt
                  lest I forget my Atenveldt
                  From deserts stark to snow-capped peaks
                  from silent lakes and laughing creeks
                  sing: Oh let man find his heart's ease
                  on rocky plains
                  in desert breeze

                  For oft I thought of mighty men
                  who carved a Land with sword and pen
                  and lit a candle, burning bright,
                  that pierced the darkness; stirred the night!
                  tho some are gone their deeds remain
                  this sunny Crown without a stain
                  sing: Oh, their deeds were not in vain!
                  in sunlit days
                  and falling rain.....

                  So raise your banners, blazoned bright
                  Advance the Dream and Shine the Light!
                  in battle's crash and Revel's song
                  raise high the Flag and wave it long!
                  For all the Lands wherein I've dwelt
                  I love you best, my Atenveldt!
                  Sing: Oh the Joy that I have felt!
                  My Atenveldt

      What the use of wearing panties
      whalebone corsets of your Auntie's
      boxer shorts and other scanties
      best of all is nude
      there's such fun in going bra-less
      now that it's no longer lawless
      'specially if your figure's flawless
      best of all is nude
      nude is what you're born in
      shirts are never torn in
      underwear and lacy flimsies, garter belts and other whimsies
      yards of itchy cloth to put your form in
      ducks all do it, maidens rue it
      even ancient Picts in Britain blue it
      going naked's how to do it
      best of all is nude!

      If your garters aren't elastic
      tie them up in knots fantastic
      (panty hose is something drastic!)
      best of all is nude!
      If you're tired of wearing clotheses
      shed your garment 'mongst the roses
      never mind the old bluenoses
      best of all is nude!
      Nude is best for ducking!
      Worst for horses bucking!
      Moonlit nights will see such sights
          that are very best for fooling round
                              .....and elbows!
      Nudity is grand to see
       a well-known antidote to virginity
      take your clothes off and you'll see:
      best of all is nude!

                   Hi said the Norn, sittin in the sand
                   once I talked to a great Grey Man
                   spun three times and said with a sigh
                   hadn't been for the Runes had his other eye!

                   Chorus: hi diddle i diddle i day

                   Hi said the Lady, dressed in green
                   prettiest thing I've ever seen
                   she went down underneath the hill
                   and came back out of her own free will

                   Brian Boru, on Irish ground
                   walked three times the Island round
                   Norsemen came lookin for a fight
                   just another Irish Saturday night!

                   Hi said Lugh on the banquest night
                   a poet and a player and a good wheelwright
                   a harper and a warrior and none the least:
                   a Druid and he got in to the Feast!

                   Harold Haardrada's face was red!
                   Came to Britain and he wound up dead
                   Stamford Bridge is where he's found
                   got six feet of English ground

                   the Legion with it's Eagles bright
                   marched into the Pictish night
                   met them there upon the sand
                   gave em up to the Wicker Man!

                   eight-legged steed and hound of Hel
                   the one-eyed Man, he loves ya well
                   fire burn and fire spark
                   are you then feared of the dark?

                   The Circle forms, the Circle flows
                   the Circle goes where no man knows
                   Hail to the Lady, one in three:
                   Present is Past and Past is Me!

                   Rhiannon's Birds are still in flight
                   all thru the Day all thru the Night
                   Hail to the Lady, one in Three
                   Present is Past and Past is Thee!

                   Hi said the Lady dressed in white
                   sang the Day and sang the Night
                   sang the Land and sang the Sea
                   sang the Song, and then sang Me!

                   (extra verses) Salt and oil and mirror bright
                                  fire and fleet and candlelight

                                  fill the cup and blessed be!

                                  From the misty crystal sea
                                  came the Lady to the lea
                                  Sword and Roses in Her Hand
                                  spread their seeds thruout the Land

                                  Came the Stag from oaken wood
                                  saw the Lady where she stood
                                  by the fire burning bright
                                  came to know his heart's delight!

                   Present is Past and Past is WE

                   By Oak and Ash and Holy Thorn

               Of those that Rule all Lands above

               When we were Sauvage, Fierce and Wilde
               they came as a Mother to her childe
               they gently raised us from the slime
               and kept our hands from Hellishe Crime
               and made us a Kingdom in their own good time

               Now, Atenveldt forgets the Past
               and thinks on a Day that's coming fast
               when we shall all be....civilized....(puke)
               neat, and clean.....and WELL-ADVISED
               oh won't the Directors be....suprised?!

        I thought all girls were beautiful and the sun was always shinin'

        Then one day, M'Lady came, and stopped the clocks from tickin'

                    WEAPONS AT THE DOOR

 Being a Polemic concerning the alleged Custom of the West Kingdom concerning 
 checking your Weapons at the Door of the Revel Hall. As the Satire is the 
 Weapon of the Bard, this said Polemic is to be checked at the Door, along with 
 swords, knives, redheaded Ladies and other such Deadly Things.....

         As I roved out to Western Lands to take the Western Air
         I went into a Revel Hall and I saw a Twelfth Night there
         but I was halted at the gate by a Privy Consellor
                 (that's the man who tells the King of the West how to go to
                  the bath room!)
         who told me I would have to check my Weapons at the door

         As I, in my astonishment, stood hung on tenter-pegs
         a Knight came in whose Prouess hung down between his legs
         the Doorman grabbed a greatsword and he struck the Knight full sore
         and gave him a reciept; he left his weapon at the door!

         a Bard was next whose goodly Voice has entertained us all
         but he, too, was prevented from entering the Hall
         and told he could not carry deadly weapons on the floor
         he left his Voice and Harp among the weapons at the door

         a Master entered graciously, a man we all know well
         who holds a 3rd Dan Black Belt, tho this he'd never tell
         the Master struggled valiantly, the Master cursed and swore
         but he left his hands, and feet, as weapons at the door

         the company was jovial, altho a bit dismayed
         for lack of proper cutlery, down to the smallest blade
         for even teeth and fingernails, each can be used in War
         were cut, and pulled, and left behind, as weapons at the door!

         And has their King not loyal Knights that He must be afraid
         of brawling in his Hall and of Assassin's bloody blade?
         the Rights of Men to carry Arms at least WE'VE not foreswore
         and a POX on them that made the Rule of Weapons at the Door!

                           THE STREETS OF ANN ARBOR

               As I walked out thru the streets of Ann Arbor
               as I walked out thru Ann Arbor one day
               I spied a young Mongol all dressed in white linen
               all dressed in white linen and cold as the clay

               I then spied another, done in on the sidewalk
               along with just about six dozen more
               their wounds were all gaping, from mace and from braoadsword
               from claymore and cannon, all dripping with gore

               what caused this grave carnage, I cried to the Monglos
               oh pray what's the reason for this awful sight
               my answer came slowly from under the corpse-pile
               ""It seems that our bark is much worse than our bite.....""

               the answer continued from pale lips a-shaking
               we sang all our songs and believed them as true
               the Dark Horde could never be beaten in battle
               we thought this was what all good Mongols could do...

               we went down to Atenveldt all for to plunder
               ""too large to defend"" was our song every night
               but Atenveldt's different from East, West or Middle
               there, even the bushes have learned how to bite!

               the Clann stole our ponies, the Scraelings our foodstuffs
               we ran into axes in AtenViking hands
               our maidens ran off with one Richard of Arkham
               and we're all that's left to return to our lands

               MacChluarains and Monsters, Lockehaven and Foxmoor
               that Kingdom is BIG and its' fighters are MEAN!
               we fought and we lost, and fled back to Ann Arbor
               we all came back home with results that you've seen

               keep away from that Land with its' cactus and marshes
               it's no place for Mongols who are bent on War
               they count their blows well, but they strick them yet better
               he crawled into his Yurt, and fell, dead, on the floor.....

       tune: the song of the Cowardly Lion, Tin Woodsman and Scarecrow
             in the movie version of the Wizard of Oz

        (Enter the Scarecrow, who singeth:)

        My wife is always nagging; my Prowess it is lagging
        I can't do anything
        she has got a reason, but revenge is out of season
        Oh I wish I could be King!

        If I just had the Crown on, I'd always have a frown on
        and the Barons on a string
        Heads they would be rolling, the Board would be cajoling
        Oh if only I was King!

        I am very fed up with the way this group is set up
        Oh I'd change everything!
        they are so high and mighty with the way that they do fight-ey
        Oh, someday I'll be King!

        Tho my wife is melancholic, and very...vitriolic
        she's a wasp without a sting!
        I'd have to supervise her with a pack of tranquilizers
        If I only was a King......

        (the Tin Woodsman joineth him, and singeth:)

        I grew up kind of cocky, and rather big, and stocky
        and straight as any rod
        on the field I'm a battallion, with the Ladies I'm a stallion
        ...Oh they'd better make me God!

        The other boys are jealous they say I'm over-zealous
        they'd do better to applaud
        the things that I am giving to this Dream that we are living
        oh I wish they'd make me God!

        They say that I'm conceited, but I'm just badly treated
        by people and by BoD
        just think of what they're missing by My Majesty dismissing
        Oh they'd better make me God!

        (the Cowardly Lion creepeth forth, and singeth:)

        Oh I could be a fighter, a great and mighty smiter
        and be the perfect knight
        it's a great and nasty shame, and everyone's to blame
        oh I wish that I could fight!

        Song of the Three (cont.)

        I could be a Cavalier drinking wine and ale and beer
        and be a gorgeous sight
        but it would cost me too much money so it isn't very funny
        oh I wish that I could fight!                               

        Let me at 'em on the field, I would surely make them yield
        to my Power and my Might
        with rattan, shinai and rapier they would nevermore escape here
        If they'd only let me fight

                She was afraid to come out to the Tourney
                She was worried that ""something might show..""
                She was afraid to come out to the Tourney
                And the poor thing did NOT want to go...

                  (2 - 3 - 4, tell the people what she wore!)

                  It was an itsy bitsy teeny weenie little rabbit fur bikini
                  That she wore, for the first time, that day.
                  An itsy bitsy teenie weenie little rabbit fur bikini
                  And in her apartment she wanted to stay!

                One day in the Kingdom of the Middle
                It happened at a Tourney one day:
                The Mongols invaded the Middle
                But the Middle did not want to play...

                  (eins - zwei - drei, but the Dark Horde wouldn't die!)

                  It was an itsy bitsy tiny teenie Nauseating Mongol weenie
                  That they saw, for the first time, that day.
                  An itsy bitsy tiny teenie Nauseating Mongol weenie
                  And the Mongols did NOT go away!

                Now the Heralds made up a new Rulebook
                And to read it is some kind of gas!
                It's a bureaucrat's dream, this new Rulebook
                Now NOBODY'S blazon can pass!

                  (Win - Place - Show, tell the Heralds where to go!)

                                 (insert Bronx cheer!)

                  I want an itsy bitsy teenie weenie little rabbit fur bikini
                  On my shield, as my blazon, today!
                  An itsy bitsy teenie weenie little rabbit fur bikini
                  But ""that's offensive"" the Heralds all say!

                I sat down at the Revel last evening
                To a feast of green meat, and Rat Pie...
                It was cold, and disgusting, and greasy
                And I just want to upchuck and die!

                  (6 - 7 - 8, tell them what was on your plate!)

                  It was an itsy bitsy teenie weenie little rabbit fur bikini
                  With a side dish of cold cabbage pie!
                  An itsy bitsy teenie weenie little rabbit fur bikini
                  With the fur on, and NOTHING inside!

                      by William Poundstone
                              1983

     Two mentalities are at work here: 1960s rock fans and 1980s
fundamentalist Christians. The idea of phonographically concealed
messages dates from the Paul McCartney death scare of 1969. For
hard-core types, the secret-message rumors never really died. Avid
rock fans have auditioned ever album release since the late 1960s
for hidden nuances. Backward messages, barely audible messages,
and messages on one stereo track only have been alleged. At the
other end of the sociosensual spectrum, fundamentalist Christians
have gotten into the act. TV programs such as PRAISE THE LORD and
THE 700 CLUB have propagated rumors of a satanic plot in the
recording industry, no less, in which various albums conceal
""backward-masked"" demonic murmurings. If THAT sounds too spacey to
be taken seriously, consider that it was the fundamentalist groups
who were behind House Resolution 6363, a bill introduced in the
U.S. House of Representatives by Robert K. Dornan (R., Calif.) in
1982 to label all suspect records: ""WARNING: THIS RECORD CONTAINS
BACKWARD MASKING THAT MAKES A VERBAL STATEMENT WHICH IS AUDIBLE
WHEN THIS RECORD IS PLAYED BACKWARD AND WHICH MAY BE PERCEPTIBLE
AT A SUBLIMINAL LEVEL WHEN THIS RECORD IS PLAYED FORWARD."" In
February 1983, the Arkansas State Senate passed a similar record-
labeling bill by a vote of 86 to 0.
     Contributing to the quasi-occult status of these rumors is
the difficulty of checking them out on home audio equipment. You
pretty much have to take someone else's word for it, or dismiss
the rumors out of hand.
     From a technical standpoint, there are four simple ways to
conceal a verbal message on a recording. The most obvious is to
record the message at a very low volume. The message may then be
recovered by turning the volume up while playing the record or
tape. If the message is faint enough, though, noise levels of home
equipment may garble it. If the accompanying music or lyrics are
loud enough, or if the message itself is indistinct or
electronically modified, it may be hard to hear on any equipment.
     A second gimmick is to record a message on one stereo track
only. Records and tapes have two independent recordings, of
course, normally played simultaneously for stereo effect. On a
record, each stereo track occupies on one side of the V-shaped
groove for the needle. On a tape, the tracks are recorded in
parallel lanes of the magnetic material. The two tracks are called
""right"" and ""left"" after the stereo speakers they will play on.
Otherwise, the tracks are interchangeable -- the sound mixer can
put anything he or she wants on each track. A message on one track
can be masked by simultaneous loud music or lyrics on the opposite
track. With normal stereo balance (or mono equipment) the loud
track drowns out the message track. At home, single-track messages
can be recovered by adjusting the stereo balance so that only the
desired track plays. Sometimes this trick also makes indistinct
words clearer. Even if the words are not exclusively on one track,
they may happen to be more audible on one track.
     A message could be recorded at a speed different from the
rest of the record. Then the record would have to be played faster
or slower than usual to recover the message. Unless the message
was at one of the standard speeds (say, 45 rpm on a 33 1/3 rpm
record), it could not be played normally on home equipment.
     The fourth and most commonly alleged trick is to record a
verbal message backward. Reversed speech has several unexpected
features. One is that syllables are not a constant in the reversal
process. A one-syllable word can have two or three syllables when
played backward. Thus ""number nine"" in the Beatles' REVOLUTION 9
reverses to ""Turn me on, dead man"" (or something like it), a jump
from three to five syllables.
     There is no simple way to predict what a word or phrase will
sound like reversed. Obviously, you can't just reverse the
letters.
     Reversed messages are difficult to recover at home. Record
turntables are not built to go backwards. Some have a neutral
setting, in which the pickup and amplifier remain active and you
can turn the record backward by hand. But hardly anyone has a
stead enough hand to produce satisfactory results.
     With patience, it is possible to reverse a cassette
recording. Transfer the music from the original record or tape
onto a blank tape cassette. Place the cassette flat on a table.
Draw our the part of the tape with the suspected message and snip
it off at both ends. Hold the tape segment horizontally. Rotate it
180 degrees, keep it horizontal at all times. This turns the tape
end for end. Splice the reversed tape segment back onto the two
loose ends of the cassette with strong adhesive tape. Reel the
tape back inside the cassette. The sliced segment will play
backward on an ordinary cassette player.
     I rented a recording studio to test the secret-message
rumors. New copiies of the records in question were transcribed on
a quarter-inch master tape. Where rumor alleged that a single
stereo track contained a message, right and left stereo tracks
were transcribed separately. Records with alleged inaudible
messages were treated similarly. To test claims of reversed
messages, recordings on the master tape were edited out and
spliced in backward. Twenty cuts or portions of cuts from sixteen
albums were tested.


""Another One Bites the Dust""
Queen, THE GAME

Rumor: When played backward, the lyrics say, ""It's fun to smoke
marijuana.""
Findings: There is something that sounds like ""It's fun to smoke
marijuana"" in the reversed music. It is repeated over and over. It
might be rendered no less faithfully, however, as ""sfun to scout
mare wanna."" This ""message"" is the reversal of the song title,
which is repeated as a line in the song.
     Let's make a distinction between engineered and phonetic
reversals. When an artist records a verbal statement, reverses it
by turning the tape end for end, mixes the reversed statement onto
a master tape, and has records and tapes produced from the master,
that is an engineered reversal. When the phonetic properties of
song lyrics are such that they can be reversed to sound like
something else, that is a phonetic reversal.
     ""It's fun to smoke marijuna"" is clearly a phonetic reversal.
The lyrics are perfectly plain played forward (""Another one bites
the dust""), no so plain played backward (""sfun to scout mare
wanna""). With an engineered reversal, the opposite should hold
true: gibberish forward, clear as a bell backward. Some are
prepared to believe that phonetic reversals are just as
intentional as engineered reversals -- that the songwriter
painstakinginly planned the phonetic double-entendre. In the
absence of confirming evidence, that just doesn't wash. It's too
easy to find coincidences. If, for example, the letters of the
alphabet are recited in conventional fashion (Ay, Bee, Cee, etc.)
and reversed, at least five sound like English language words. D
reverses to ""eden,"" F becomes ""pray,"" S becomes ""say,"" V becomes
""even,"" and Z becomes ""easy."" ""It's fun to smoke marijuana"" is
likewise a coincidence.


""A Child is Coming""
Jefferson Starship, BLOWS AGAINST THE EMPIRE

Rumor: When played backward, ""son of Satan.""
Findings: Another phonetic coincidence. The repeated ""It's getting
better"" reverses to an iffy ""son of Satan,"" the ""of"" drawn out and
the ""Satan"" strongly accented on the first syllable.


""Eldorado""
Electric Light Orchestra, ELDORADO

Rumor: When played backward, ""He is the nasty one/ Christ, you're
infernal/ It is said we're dead men/ Everyone who has the mark
will live.""
Findings: Coincidence. The supposed message lurks around the line
""On a voyage of no return to see."" Reversed, this passage becomes
the expected syllable salad -- no one hearing it would describe it
as anything but reversed music. Only if you listen while reading
along with what you're supposed to hear will you get anything. The
rumored version of the message is somewhat fudged. The passage
sounds more like ""He's to nasty one/ Christ you are, Christ,
you're fernal/ There wiss uh, we're dead men..."" There is no ""in""
in what is taken to be ""infernal."" The line that is supposed to be
""Everyone who has the mark will live"" isn't even close, though the
syllable count is right.


""Shoo Be Doo""
The Cars, CANDY-O

Rumor: When played backward, the word ""Satan"" repeated
approximately eleven times.
Findings: Coincidence. The rumor refers to the reversal of the ""Shoo
be doo, shoo be doo, shoo be doo..."" near the end of the song. Given
the mysterious logic of reversed phonemes, these three-syllable units
can be hard as a repeated two-syllable word. The word sounds a little
like ""Satan.""


""Snowblind""
Styx, PARADISE THEATER

Rumor: According to a mimeographed list of suspect records distributed
by Congressman Dornan, the words ""Satan move through our voices"" when
played backwards.
Findings: Negative. Despite repeated listenings, it was not even
possible to identify the part of the reversed track that Dornan et al.
are talking about.


""Stairway to Heaven""
Led Zeppelin, untitled, a.k.a. STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN

Rumor: In reverse, ""I live for Satan... The Lord turns me off...
There's no escaping it... Here's to my sweet Satan... There's power in
Satan... He will give you 666.""
Findings: Coincidence. If you listen very carefully to the ""And it
makes me wonder"" lines in reverse, you'll hear something approaching
""There's no escaping it."" A better description is ""There's no escape
do."" Knock of the last syllable, and you have ""There's no escape,"" a
complete, intelligible sentence in reverse. It's there, all right, but
it's not an unlikely enough coincidence to -- well, make you wonder.
      The ""Satan"" in ""I live for Satan"" is good and clear. The ""I live
for"" part isn't. The other alleged lines are unremarkable. All are
phonetic reversals of the entirely lucid forward lyrics and obviously
just accidents.


""When Electricity Came to Arkansas""
Black Oak Arkansas, BLACK OAK ARKANSAS and RONCH AND ROLL

Rumor: In reverse, ""Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan. He is God. He
is God.""
Findings: The BLACK OAK ARKANSAS cut was reversed. Again, pairs of
reversed syllables are being freely interpreted as ""Satan."" ""He is
God"" was not identifiable.


""Rain""
The Beatles, HEY JUDE

Rumor: Unintelligible lyrics at the end are reversed.
Findings: A true engineered reversal and not really a secret. ""Rain""
seems to have been the first popular recording to incorporate an
obviously reversed lyric. The story is that John Lennon accidentally
spliced the last part of the song in backward and liked the effect.
When reversed, the strange-sounding vocals at the end become
intelligible as a reprise starting with the drawn-out word
""sunshine.""
      The reversal is less apparent to the casual listener than it
might be because the accompanying music is not reversed. The ending
fits in smoothly with the rest of the song, the vocals suggesting a
foreign language.


""Fire on High""
Electric Light Orchestra, FACE THE MUSIC

Rumor: When played backward, ""The music is reversible, but time --
turn back!""
Findings: ""Fire on High"" is instrumental. About twenty-six seconds
into the music, scrambled speech is heard. It is mostly louder than
the accompanying music and begins with a two-syllable unit repeated
several times. The seeming speech lasts for about fourteen seconds.
      Reversing the music confirms that there is a true, engineered
message. In reverse, a voice (Jeff Lynne's?) says, ""The music is
reversible, but time -- turn back! Turn back! Turn back! Turn back!""
All the words are clear and unambiguous. Anyone comparing this to the
alleged reversal on ELO's ""Eldorado"" will have no trouble telling
which is genuine.


""Goodbye Blue Sky""
Pink Floyd, THE WALL

Rumor: In reverse, ""You have discovered the secret message.""
Findings: The ""secret message"" is at the very end of the instrumental
passage following the ""Goodbye Blue Sky"" vocals. It comes just before
the words ""What shall we do"" at the start of the song that is
identified as ""Empty Spaces"" on the record label and as ""What shall we
do now?"" on the record sleeve. Played forward, the message is less
apparent than the FACE THE MUSIC reversal: A reasonably attentive
listener might play THE WALL through and not catch it. It suggests
speech not quite close enough to be overheard. In context this is not
unusual because the ""Goodbye Blue Sky"" instrumental passage includes
""airport noises"" and other sound effects. A loud climax in the music
further masks the unintelligible voice.
      When played backward, the voice (Roger Waters?) plainly intones,
""Congratulations, you have just discovered the secret message. Please
send your answer to old Pink, care of the funny farm..."" As the voice
fades out, there may be another word -- perhaps ""Chalfonte or
""Chelsea"" -- after ""funny farm.""


""Heavy Metal Poisoning""
Styx, KILROY WAS HERE

Rumor: A red sticker on the KILROY WAS HERE cover warns, ""By order of
the Majority for Musical Morality, this album contains secret backward
messages...""
Findings: This is a case of second-generation backward-masking. Styx'
PARADISE THEATER did not contain a backward message, though a lot of
people said it did. So Styx has included a sure enough backward
message on KILROY WAS HERE. It is at the very beginning of ""Heavy
Metal Poisoning."" The reversed speech last about three seconds. There
is no musical background. The words reverse to ""Annuit coeptis. Novus
ordo seclorum."" This is the Latin motto encircling the pyramid on the
back of a dollar bill. The usual translation: ""God has favored our
undertakings. A new order of the ages.""
      The cover sticker's ""Majority for Musical Morality"" is a
fictitious Falwellesque group in the KILROY WAS HERE video. Although
the sticker suggests a plurality of ""messages,"" only one was found.


Space between ""I'm So Tired"" and ""Blackbird""
The Beatles, untitled, a.k.a. THE WHITE ALBUM

Rumor: A reversed message. At the time of the Paul-is-dead stories,
the segue from ""I'm So Tired"" to ""Blackbird"" was offered as evidence.
It was held to contain John Lennon's voice, reveresed, saying ""Paul is
dead, miss him, miss him, miss him."" That interpretation seems
unlikely now, but there is a mysterious low muttering between the
songs.
Findings: The mumbling is actually just to the ""I'm So Tired"" side of
the shiny ""space"" between cuts on the record. Each of the stereo
tracks was recorded separately, twice, and a copy of each track was
reversed. This produced four versions of the two-second passage: right
forward, left forward, right reversed, and left reversed. All were
equally unintelligible. It was not even apparent whether the voice is
forward or reversed. Nor could John Lennon be identified as the
speaker. There are nine or ten syllables. The first six (when played
forward) are a two-syllable unit repeated three times. There is little
or no difference betwen the stereo tracks. Any claimed interpretation
of the sounds seems doubtful.


""Strawberry Fields Forever""
The Beatles, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR

Rumor: It was, of course, claimed that John Lennon says ""I buried
Paul"" at the end. (It's forward, at the very end after the music
fades to complete silence, returns, and starts to fade out again.)
But Lennon told ROLLING STONE that the words are ""cranberry
sauce.""
Findings: They are ""cranberry sauce."" The ""sauce""/""Paul"" part is
indistinct, but the first syllable sounds a lot more like ""cran""
than ""I.""


""Baby You're a Rich Man""
The Beatles, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR

Rumor: On one of the tracks the line ""Baby you're a rich man too""
is sung as ""Baby you're a rich fag Jew,"" a dig at Brian Epstein.
Or some think it's ""rich fat Jew"" and claim it as evidence of
Beatle anti-Semitism.
Findings: Negative. The two stereo tracks are nearly identical.
It's always possible to hear words as similar-sounding words, but
basically, the lyrics jibe with the published version.


""Revolution 9""
The Beatles, untitled, a.k.a. THE WHITE ALBUM

Rumor: Various reversed and/or one-track speech. The reversal of
""Number nine"" to ""Turn me on, dead man"" has pretty much been
discounted as coincidence (though it appears on Congressman
Dornan's list).
Findings: Distinction between lyrics and any hidden message blurs
on ""Revolution 9."" The eight-minute cut is a montage of sounds
collected by John Lennon and Yoko Ono. It includes discordant
music, radio broadcasts, sirens, applause, gunfights, sports
cheers, the crackling of a fire, screams, a baby gurgling, a choir
singing, and much that cannot be identified. For this
investigation, ""Revolution 9"" was transcribed four times, twice on
each stereo channel. One copy of each of the tracks was reversed.
The four resulting versions were compared with each other and
against the original two-channel version.
     ""Revolution 9"" contains a lot of talking. Played in stereo,
forward, the longest stretch of understandable speech is probably
an announcer saying, ""...every one of them knew that as time went
by they'd get a little bit older and a little bit slower...""
     One believable instance of reversed speech occurs: someone
saying ""Let me out! Let me out!"" (once held to represent McCartney
in his totaled Aston-Martin). Two iffy reversals occur on the
backward recording of the right stereo track:""She used to be
assistant"" and ""There were two men..."" Neither is clear enough or
long enough to be convincing. Some of the music, including the
recurring theme, sounds more natural in reverse.
     ""Turn me on, dead man"" is a typical phonetic reversal. The
forward ""number nine"" (repeated throughout the cut) is clear; the
reversal is slurred -- something like ""turn me on dedmun."" It has
been claimed that ""number nine"" must be pronounced with a British
accent or with some careful inflection in order to reverse to
""Turn me on, dead man."" This seems not to be so. As an experiment,
three American-accent renderings of ""number nine"" were reversed.
All sound about as much like ""Turn me on, dead man"" as the record
did. Like the other phonetic reversals, ""Turn me on, dead man""
must be considered a coincidence.
     Much of ""Revolution 9"" is on one stereo track only. Near the
end a voice says ""A fine natural imbalance...the Watusi...the
twist...Eldorado...Eldorado."" ""A fine natural imbalance"" is on the
right track only, though the words that follow are in stereo. One
of the longer bits of speech -- ""Who could tell what he was
saying? His voice was low and his [unintelligible] was high and
his eyes were low"" -- is clear on the left track, a bare whisper
on the right.
     There is a stereophonically concealed ""secret message"" on
""Revolution 9."" The words are on the right track. They begin about
four minutes, fifty-eight seconds into the cut and run for about
twenty-two seconds. They are not likely to be noticed in stereo
because of the much louder left track. The sound of applause
begins on the left track at about five minutes, one second into
the cut. Deafening noises -- the clapping, sirens, music --
continue on the left track until five minutes, forty seconds. It
may or may not have been Lennon's and Ono's intention to conceal
the spoken passage. Given the haphazard quality of ""Revolution 9,""
the concealment may have been accidental. To recover the passage,
the left track must be switched off. The right track can then be
heard to contain a sound like a stopwatch ticking, behind these
words:

     So the wife called, and we better go to see a
     surgeon....[A SCREAM MUFFLES A LINE THAT SOUNDS LIKE
     Well, what with the prices, the prices have snowballed,
     no wonder it's closed.] ...So any and all, we went to
     see the dentist instead, who gave him a pair of teeth,
     which wasn't any good at all. So instead of that he
     joined the bloody navy and went to sea.
                      by William Poundstone
                              1986

     There really are backward messages on rock albums. And the
controversy over ""backward masking"" and ""porn rock"" has inspired a
whole new spate of messages. There may have been more genuine
backward messages in the past few years than ever before.
     The backward message controversy is usually traced to the
1960s and John Lennon's avant-garde sound mixing on such tracks as
""Revolution 9"" on the Beatles' WHITE ALBUM. Lennon probably wasn't
trying to conceal a message so much as create an interesting
sound.
     The matter might have ended right there had it not been for
the Paul McCartney death rumor. College kids tried playing Beatles
records forward, backward, and at various speeds to find ""clues""
to McCartney's fate. In the process they found snippets of speech
from Lennon's experiments. Even after McCartney was found safe and
sound in Scotland, some listeners continued to look for hidden
messages.
     Somehow, fundamentalist Christian groups became convinced
(ca. 1982) that the alleged messages were commercials for devil
worship. Not a single indisputable satanic message has turned up,
but there were scattered attempts to ban or label certain albums.
In 1986 one fundamentalist group announced that the theme song for
the old MR. ED TV show contains the word ""Satan"" when played
backward.)
     Ironically, the publicity accorded nonexistent messages has
inspired several artists -- among them porn rock hearing witness
Frank Zappa -- to hide real background messages in their music.
It's easy to do.
     The performer speaks or sings the message normally, then
reverses the tape, which is mixed into the soundtrack. This is all
accomplished simply enough at any recording studio.
     What's not so simple is playing it back. More home record,
cassette, and compact disk players won't play backward. You can
turn a record backward with a pencil eraser, but it's not good for
the needle or the turntable. The only way to reproduce the message
with full fidelity is to use a professional-quality reel-to-reel
tape player and splice the tape in backward.
     We used the facilities of KLOS radio in Los Angeles to
reverse some recent records containing true backward messages.


""Secret Messages""
Electric Light Orchestra, SECRET MESSAGES

ELO's ELDORADO album was among those alleged to contain satanic
backward masked messages. A patient listening to ELDORADO played
backward reveals no such messages. You hear only what you ought to
hear -- the reversed lyrics of the songs, which sound nothing like
the ""messages"" claimed to be there. In the wake of such
allegations, ELO did put an (innocuous) backward message on their
FACE THE MUSIC album. Perhaps they thought this would show how
silly the allegations were. Instead, the backward-masking people
seized on this as proof that the other ""messages"" were real. In
the latest volley, ELO has named an album after the controversy.
     In Britain (where the backward-masking issue is viewed as an
American eccentricity), the cover of SECRET MESSAGES has a mock
warning label to youth about the hidden label. Word of the albums'
impending release in the United States caused enough of a furor to
chill CBS Records into deleting the cover blurb.
     The reversed message is easy to find. It's at the beginning
of the first song, which is itself called ""Secret Messages."" You
can hear reversed speech when you play the record normally. A
voice intones ""secret messages"" -- forward -- in the middle of the
reversed speech, lest anyone dare be so unhip as to not know
what's going on.
     We transferred a new copy of SECRET MESSAGES to reel-to-reel
tapes and played it backward. The backward message goes: ""WELCOME
TO THE BIG SHOW/ WELCOME TO THE BIG SHOW.""
     That's it.


""Ya Hozna""
Frank Zappa, THEM OR US

""Ya Hozna,"" a six-minute composition on the first record of the
THEM OR US double album, is ENTIRELY backward. The albums' inner
cover, which includes lyrics for the other songs, says, ""backwards
vocal -- you figure it out"" of this cut. It credits Frank and Moon
Zappa, George Duke, and Napoleon Murphy Brock as vocalists.
     Played forward, ""Ya Howza"" sounds like a record played
backward -- reasonably so. The vocals are prominent and
unintelligible. Moon Zappa's voice is curiously recognizable, even
in reverse. It is hard to tell whether the music was recorded
forward or backward.
     When ""Ya Howza"" is played in reverse, you discover that the
music is virtually a palindrome -- it sounds about the same
forward and backward. The voices are all backward. In some cases
they have been modified electronically. Many of the words are
muffled. Even after repeated careful listening on both stereo
tracks, it is difficult to make out many of the lyrics. It doesn't
help that some of the words seem to be stream-of-consciousness
nonsense. Some of the unintelligible stuff sounds like opera.
     Starting at the beginning of the reversed tape -- the end of
the forward tape -- the clearer vocals go like this: ""I am the
heaven, I am the water."" This is in a hymnlike register. ""You are
a lonely little girl./ But your mommy and your daddy hold you."" A
singsong synthesizer voice.
     The most interesting part of the lyrics is an intermittently
orgasmic rap in Moon Zappa's Valley Girl voice. There are three
short monologues:

I'm like green!
I'm like squat!
I'm like soul!
Repeat, like soul!
I'm like pull, push,
Okay, like slow, slow.

You're never too old
Like slow, like slow, like slow
Okay, I like it.


All right, faster, faster,
Go, do it, do it twice,
Yeah, that feels good,
I'm looking great,
Yeah, fer shure!
Like, no way!


""No Anchovies, Please""
J. Geils Band, LOVE STINKS

""No Anchovies, Please"" is a novelty song, really a narration with
sound effects, about a woman who is kidnapped after eating
anchovies. She is taken to a ""foreign-speaking"" country. The sound
effect of the foreign tongue seems reversed. When you do play it
in reverse, it becomes: ""It doesn't take a genius to know the
difference between chicken shit and chicken salad.""


""Darling Nikki""
Prince, PURPLE RAIN

""Darling Nikki,"" cited as porn rock before Congress, is about a
dominatrix in a hotel lobby masturbating with a magazine. In part,
the complaint was that the album cover (flowers, and Prince on a
motorcycle) wasn't explicit enough to warn kids of the suggestive
lyrics. Senator Paula Hawkins apparently was not aware of a
backward message hidden in ""Darling Nikki."" The last thirty-five
seconds of the song is gibberish. The music changes abruptly and
becomes a repeated glottal sound. Then a two-syllable sound is
repeated twice, something like ""heaven, heaven."" Unintelligible
speech follows. At the end is a sound reminiscent of rain or bacon
frying , and wind sounds.
     Played backward, the message becomes:

     Hello, how are you?
     I'm fine 'cause I know that the Lord is coming soon.
     Coming, coming soon.

     It is clearly Prince and the Revolution singing this. The
words are clear but the intonation is funny -- the linger on some
words. Perhaps this is to make the reversed message you hear
playing the record normally a little less conspicuous.
     This is a weird reversal of the supposed secret message
menace. Raunchy forward lyrics conceal a religious secret message.


""Judas Kiss""
Petra, MORE POWER TO YOU

Petra is an obscure group that sings religious songs to a rock
beat. As further proof that things have gone full circle, the
backward-masking controversy prompted Petra to include a wholesome
backward message on their MORE POWER TO YOU album. It is in the
transition between two songs, just before ""Judas Kiss."" Clearly
audible gibberish reverses to this (the husky voice a cross
between George Beverly Shea and Dee Snider): ""What are you looking
for the Devil for, when you ought to be looking for the Lord?""

AFL JoyceM Welcome to the Apple II Music & Sound chat - our discussion will
           be on NoiseTracker - the new FTA music program for the GS.  AFA
           Gene will be our host this evening...Gene, the floor is yours :)

AFA Gene   Hi all... well first I'd like to point out, if y'all aren't aware
           yet, that a spanking new version of NoiseTracker has recently
           been released (9 days ago) and is now available in our New Files
           library. It is version 0.5. I haven't played around with it much
           yet, but it's supposed to fix a lot of the little bugs in 0.3
           (the first version we had online).  NoiseTracker also includes
           the ability to directly import ""modules,"" a term used for a
           certain type of Amiga song file which has become popular among PC
           users using the SoundBlaster sound card.

           Now, via NT, these ""MOD"" files are accessible by the GS. We
           expect to see a lot of activity on this end as far as ports from
           the PC and Amiga go. Note that you should be able to go straight
           to the PC music forum and download any recently uploaded MOD
           songfiles (there was a bug in the first wide release of the PCAO
           software, however, so a bunch of files with dates between around
           March 1991 and September 1991 may not download properly. Note that
           to use these PC MOD files, you'll have to rename the downloaded
           file ""MOD.xxxxxx"" if you want it to show up automatically in NT's
           ""open"" dialog box. (On the PC, all MOD files are named
           ""xxxxxxxx.MOD"" instead.)   Also, if the files are packed with ZIP
           compression, you'll need a program from the Communications Forum
           called AGATE -- it's a terminal program that includes the ability
           to unpack ZIP files.

           Now, I guess the best thing to do would be to talk about our
           favorite songfiles... there have been a few complaints, in fact,
           that people were not being ""descriptive"" enough in their file
           descriptions for uploads in describing the songs.

AFC Eddie  ?

AFA Gene   GA ed

AFC Eddie  Once a MOD file is unpacked with Agate, is a file type change
           needed?

AFA Gene   Nope, since all that NT looks for is the ""MOD."" being the first
           four characters in the filename.

AFC Eddie  OK, Thanks!

Deanna7332 Question...

JonL7      Can you list some of the features of Noisetracker?

AFA Gene   (you don't even need that ""MOD."" if you want to type the name in
           directly.)

Deanna7332 Did any of these mod files have anything to do with FTA's ""Module
           A""

AFA Gene   Sure Jon, right after we answer Deanna's question. Deanna, you
           mean ""Modulae?""

Deanna7332 Yes, that's it.

AFA Gene   Modulae was a demo written by FTA last year. (i'll get to you in a
           sec Doors).  It used SoundSmith v0.95 for all it's music. There
           is no connection between MOD files and Modulae by FTA.

Deanna7332 Throughout the demo it said ""Loading modules""

AFA Gene   Those ""modules"" are not the same as Amiga soundfile ""modules"" --
           you see, what Modulae really was was a ""stringing together"" of a
           bunch of neat little tiny demos that FTA had written. So they
           called each little demo a ""module"" and thus the entire demo as a
           whole, ""Modulae"" (fancy plural of module?)

Deanna7332 Ok I understand.  Thank you. :)

AFL JoyceM Latin, Gene :)

AFA Gene   The term ""MODule"" from the Amiga comes from the idea that all the
           stuff needed to play the songfile (all the instruments + the
           sequence file) are included into one file, the ""module.""

TheDoors1  Gene, I have tried to d/l some recent uploaded MODs in the PC
           music area and still the problem exists.

AFA Gene   As I understand it, the problem was fixed VERY recently (correct
           me on this Joyce) and files uploaded as recently as early
           November still might not work depending on the version of the
           PCAO software that the uploader used.

AFL JoyceM Actually, Gene...I was under the impression that it had been, but
           if Doors is still having a problem, then it must not be fixed.

AFA Gene   What date was the file you tried to d/l, Door?

TheDoors1  umm 11/17, around there

AFA Gene   hmmm.... well i can tell you one thing... if it didn't work, don't
           waste your time again later... the problem is in the Apple
           software's method of d/lling files, and there are no plans to
           upgrade the Apple AO software.

AFL JoyceM I will endeavor to get an answer to that PC downloading
           problem/question :)

ThomasK63  i have a quick question... what can you use to unpack amiga mod
           files? On the PC side, that is.

TheDoors1  Agate Thomas

ELECTMUSIC Doors... what happens on after downloading..

Deanna7332 If it's LZHed you can't unless you have an IBM or
           PC/Transporter.

AFA Gene   If GS-ShrinkIt doesn't have that ability, i don't think there
           exists any such utility on the GS.

TheDoors1  What do you mean Elect?

ELECTMUSIC After you download the file... where do you encounter a problem?

TheDoors1  ok, you know when you download the file and at some point in the
           download the file starts to appear on your screen.  That's when I
           cancel it.

ThomasK63  I am sure soething good can be made w/out resorting to Amiga
           files

AFC Eddie  Yes, Doors, I believe the problem is with the PC software it was
           UL'd with.

TheDoors1  yeah Eddie.

GNO Tim    Amiga MOD files are typically compressed using LHarc.  I've
           uncompressed several on my Unix machine at school.

ThomasK63  good time for someone to make a lharc unpacker...

AFC DYAJim someone might be ;)

GNO Tim    Several people are already

AFC Eddie  Can't wait, Jim!

AFA Gene   Jon, did you have a question?

JonL7      The features of Noisetracker :)

AFA Gene   Oh yes... okay, here goes, in a nutshell, from most important to
           least:


AFA Gene   *  ability to import MOD files

           *  ability to import Soundsmith files

           *  ProDOS 8 based

           *  virtually no editing abilities (not a feature but important to
           know)

AFC DYAJim :)

AFA Gene   *  forgot: and the most important feature of all, the ability to
           hold instrument files in regular system RAM instead of DOC RAM,
           allowing for instruments far beyond the regular 64K limit found
           in ALL other GS music programs.

ThomasK63  I'll buy that!

TheDoors1  I have another question...when you're ready.

AFA Gene   GA Doors

TheDoors1  ok..is it true that NoiseTracker will take in soundsmith files and
           play them more clearly

AFA Gene   Well, as far as ""what you hear,"" yes there is a definite
           difference with some instruments. It does NOT play the sounds
           more ""clearly,"" but it just plays them in a different way. What
           many people seem to like about this ""different way"" is that
           sustained instruments (i.e. instruments designed to be played
           in a loop to simulate a long held note) seem to work better (or
           perhaps simply the way they were originally intended to work).

TheDoors1  I see

Deanna7332 Which takes up more space - MOD or NT  w/soundfile ?

AFA Gene   Deanna, it depends a few things, such as how big the sequence is,
           how many instruments you have, etc. Once you have a lot of
           assorted files, it'll probably average out to be about the same
           give or take a hundred blocks on your HD. So it basically depends
           on whether you prefer to have your instruments separate or not.

Deanna7332 Does playing quality differ with either one ?

AFA Gene   Nope. It's exactly the same either way. Loading time is the same
           too.

AFC Eddie  Can NT save songs as MOD files?

AFA Gene   Nope. It has options for Open and Close module, but these are
           still inactive.

AFA Gene   If there are no more questions, I'd like to talk about which NT
           files out there are the ""hottest,"" since this info could be
           useful to many users who are interested in downloading NT/MOD
           files.

           My personal favorite is ""Lambada,"" which is supplied by FTA with
           the program but is available separately on America
           Online.Everything about this file is really impressive except
           perhaps the sound quality of the horn-ish melody instrument.

           What about y'all, what are your favorite NT files?

AFL JoyceM Gene, there is a classical song for NT, but can't remember the
           name, but it is good.

AFC Eddie  I like Dragnet!

ELECTMUSIC So do I Ed

TheDoors1  I like Seven something

Deanna7332 My most favorite of all mod files is Pleasure Principle

AFC Eddie  <--appreciate's Greg's taste!

AFL JoyceM :)

AFA Gene   Deanna, i assume you got that from a local board?

Deanna7332 I got it from the PC forum here.

TheDoors1  I saw it there also

Deanna7332 I think under ""Pleasure""

AFA Gene   Would you be able to upload it here? If it's really that good, we
           ought to have it available directly in our oun NT lib here (BTW
           folks, we will be releasing a new NoiseTracker software library
           soon!)

AFC Eddie  What a Forum!!!

Deanna7332 That sounds great!

AFL JoyceM Gene, do you think it will be possible for synthLAB files to be
           converted to MOD files?

AFL JoyceM MOD files?

AFA Gene   I doubt it, Joyce. The formats are so diametrically opposed in
           their entire basis of their file formats that it wouldn't be
           worth the time for a programmer to develop such a convertor.

Deanna7332 Isn't it possible to move the mod file from the PC forum to our
           music library?

AFA Gene   But..... it might be worth the time for a MIDI File Format to MOD
           convertor, since these two formats are more widely accepted.

Nuzz       they have nothing better to do Gene

ELECTMUSIC Gene.. some interesting similarities with DTune and NTracker

AFA Gene   They lose the file, tho, Deanna. :)

AFL JoyceM In what way, Greg?

ELECTMUSIC Both Prodos 8

Deanna7332 Shhh they won't know a thing :)

ELECTMUSIC I also believe Bill uses a shuttling of sound data between Doc
           Ram and Ram.

AFC Eddie  Interesting, Greg.

ELECTMUSIC Thats how he gets some of the excellent instrument quality

AFC Eddie  But Diversitune has that one distinction:  MIDI input.

AFL JoyceM Deanna, we would greatly appreciate it if you would upload that
           'Pleasure' song to our library :)

ELECTMUSIC Agreed Ed.. one of the factors FTA doesn't like to incorporate
           into their programs.

Deanna7332 I'll u/l it tonight if possible.

AFL JoyceM Thanks :)

AFC Eddie  Thanks, Deanna!

AFL JoyceM I will send Bill B a copy of NoiseTracker + some MOD files...to
           see what comments we get from him (will send when I get back).

AFC DYAJim What ever happened to that diversitune upgrade that was talked
           about ?

ELECTMUSIC That would be interesting Joyce

AFC Eddie  Bill apparently still working on it, Jim.

ELECTMUSIC I am sure he would appreciate the Prodos 8

AFC DYAJim good..

AFL JoyceM Jim...RSN....he was hoping by Christmas (this year), but he is
           soooo busy with his job, who knows?

AFC DYAJim Oh yeah, I noticed the speed calcuation in NT .5 is inaccurate
           :)

AFC DYAJim I recall he has set a lot of Christmas projected dates :)

ELECTMUSIC He was one of the first ""Free Tools"" experts in breaking all the
           rules for economic sake.

AFC DYAJim like for the vaporware DT inst editor like 2 years ago.

Deanna7332 Are there any Christmas Mod or NT songs?

AFC Eddie  Oh yeah, Diversi-Editor!

AFL JoyceM I know, Jim - but that I know he has been working on.

AFC DYAJim he projected Christmas for it, and it never came :)

AFA Gene   Not yet in AMS, but hopefully the Holiday Contest will change all
           that. :)

AFC DYAJim I look foreward to any upgrades..

AFL JoyceM Not that I am aware of Deanna - you have some?  hint, hint

Deanna7332 Nope sorry.  I was hoping there were some that could be u/led
           here

AFC DYAJim I'll be breaking out the xmas tune book rsn.. I should be able to
           midi a few :) (which rules out nt)

AFL JoyceM Question...

AFC Eddie  It would be more appropriate to have a converter from Appleworks
           spreadsheet to MOD than from MIDI!

AFL JoyceM If I got ahold of an Amiga song (MOD) disk...how would I convert
           them for here?

AFA Gene   You mean an Amiga-formatted disk?

AFL JoyceM Yes

AFC DYAJim Ack.. methinks you need an amiga and a null modem cable or a
           modem.

AFA Gene   Methinks Jim is right

AFC DYAJim LOL!!  Design your music in the spreadsheet then import to NT :)
           IT might actually have better editing?!! :)

AFC Eddie  Right!

AFL JoyceM Me thinks he is right.  If I had them upload to me, would that
           work?

AFA Gene   Yep; should work like a charm.

AFC DYAJim Yah.. as long as they're coming from an amiga

AFL JoyceM Great....I will work on that when I get back  (making note now).

AFL JoyceM Gene, will you get some of those files (NT) sent to that area
           tonight?  If so, I will leave the needed message :)

AFA Gene   That's all I have planned for tonight's chat, Joyce. Yep, I'll
           move some files right now.

AFL JoyceM Thanks...

AFL JoyceM Then we should have our NoiseTracker Library by end of the week in
           AMS :)

ELECTMUSIC Gene... quick question:  Are you launching NTracker from a 3.5
           disk?

AFL JoyceM Okay, guys...I will see you all the week of December 11th (may the
           4th) as I am off on vacation.

AFA Gene   Yep greg

AFC JohnC  Where are you going?

ELECTMUSIC Do you encounter out of memory problems

AFL JoyceM Night all...and Gene, thanks for an excellent chat and great
           explanations of NoiseTracker.

Nuzz       Joyce, I have good news for FutureSound owners. SoundConvert will
           support it in the first release

AFC Eddie  Great, Mike!

AFA Gene   Greg, i always keep my RAMdisk at 0 when using noisetracker. Not
           only are

AFC JohnC  Mike...SoundConvert...released?

AFL JoyceM Great, Mike.  When can we get SoundConvert, Mike? and FutureSound
           :)

AFA Gene   there a couple of bugs with memory management, but if you're
           loading in a MOD file that's really big, NT will eat your RAMdisk.

AFC Eddie  Sounds good.

Nuzz       The manual is being ""layout"". Release date should be about 1st
           week of Dec

ELECTMUSIC Tnxs Gene

AFC JohnC  YES.......WTG Nuzz!!!!!!!!

Deanna7332 Yes, why is there on some MOD files a stop somewhere in the middle
           ?

Deanna7332 That's really frustrating!

AFL JoyceM Mike, leave me E-Mail on when and how I can send your the $$ to
           get it.

AFL JoyceM Again...night all

Nuzz       gee John, I had to do something to explain the delay :)

ELECTMUSIC Thanks Gene for a GREAT chat!

AFC Eddie  Yes, Gene!  Great!

AFA Gene   Thanks Greg, 'night!

AFA Gene   thanx, see y'all later :)

Copyright 1987 Bob Szekely.

    John Michael Osbourne, (known as ""Ozzy"" to his fans), has in his long 
career as vocalist for Black Sabbath had his work with the group misconstrued 
as advocating Satanism.  In a 1983 radio special featuring Ozzy, the 
interviewer expressed precisely this point; ""...Ozzy has always been shrouded 
in the darkest of Satanic imagery.  Yet if you really listen to his music, 
you'll find that what he is saying differs greatly from his image....""(1)  Even 
the group's image has often been described as ""occult and diabolic"".(2)

    The important point to remember here is to differentiate between appearance 
and reality.  Although the name ""Black Sabbath"" conjures up images of witches 
and sorcerers paying homage to Satan for the powers bestowed upon them, this 
does not make it safe to assume that the group that went by this name 
necessarily drew the inspiration from the occult.(3)  The closest they ever 
came to it was a gothic horror film featuring Boris Karloff as narrator; they 
adopted their name directly from the name of this film.(4)  Black Sabbath was 
involved in the black arts as much as Karloff practiced casting spells off-
screen.  Tony Iommi, the group's guitarist, summed it up best when he described 
the group as having basically ""...the same appeal as a horror movie.  It's all 
an act.""(5)










    Just as their film counterpart did, Ozzy and Sabbath found the occult 
mythos to be an effective vehicle for powerful social commentary; particularly 
when put in the context of heavy-metal rock and roll.  Ozzy himself noted that 
there are ""...people who pick up my [album] cover[s] and go...'This guy's got 
to be singing about Devil, doom, death and destruction.'  Which is not the 
case....""(6)

    The late Lester Bangs likened the group to Bob Dylan and William Burroughs, 
describing them all as ""...moralists...trying to deal with a serious present 
situation in an honest way....""(7)  Ozzy and Black Sabbath merely bring to 
light the many evils of our world in their work, to try and make us realize 
that we are all victim to their influence.  They hope to make us recognize 
these evils so that we may take up arms against them; a point Ozzy emphatically 
stresses:  ""...one thing everybody has got to understand about Black Sabbath's 
lyrics.  They're not downer lyrics, they're just telling everybody where it's 
at...""(8)  He also cites the group's most controversial tune, ""Black Sabbath"", 
as a response to the ignorant hippie culture still force when the tune was 
written in 1970:  ""The hippies said: 'The world is beautiful man.' (sic)  You 
only had to look around you to see how crappy it was.  It was ridiculous 
listening to that stuff, let alone playing it, so we just wrote about the world 
the way it really was and how it affected us - and we felt better in ourselves 
because we were really being honest....""(9)

    IV  23  IS YOUR MIND SO SMALL THAT YOU HAVE TO FALL
        24 IN WITH THE PACK WHEREVER THEY RUN
        25  WILL YOU STILL SNEER WHEN DEATH IS NEAR

        28  THAT CRUCIFIED CHRIST
        29  I THINK IT IS SAD THE OPINION YOU HADE WAS THE
        30  ONLY ONE VOICED.
        31  WILL YOU BE SO SURE WHEN YOUR DAY IS NEAR
        32  SAY YOU DON'T BELIEVE?
        33  YOU HAD THE CHANCE BUT YOU TURNED IT DOWN
        34  NOW YOU CAN'T RETRIEVE.










    VI  35  PERHAPS YOU'LL THINK BEFORE YOU SAY THAT
        36  GOD IS DEAD AND GONE
        37  OPEN YOUR EYES, JUST REALIZE THAT HE IS THE
        38  ONE.
        39  THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN SAVE YOU KNOW FROM
        40  ALL THIS SIN AND HATE.
        41  OR WILL YOU STILL JEER AT ALL YOU HEAR?
        42  YES!-I THINK IT'S TOO LATE.

    In this piece, the group asserts a belief in an afterlife and spiritual 
redemption.  As grisly as the image of a hanged pontiff is, its shock value is 
a necessary part of the message:  They reject religious dogma, stating that a 
belief in God, in one's own heart, is the only guiding light to help one inn 
his life (lines 11/12, 39/40).  Furthermore, the reject religious hypocrisy 
(lines 5/6, 7/8) and peer pressure (verses III, IV) as excuses for not 
accepting God.  To clarify further:  following the crowd does not justify 
shrugging responsibility for one's own actions.

    After re-reading, it becomes obvious that this song is an ascerbic critique 
of atheism; (line 35/36) I refer here again to verses three and four.  In these 
two verses, the picture painted in one of Godless conformity and how it's 
viewed as being as foolish as Paganism.  These lyrics set an example for the 
listener by relating personal experience (lines 13-16).  However, for those who 
cannot accept this the group has no recourse but to condemn them, although 
rather ironically; they hope that their rhetorical loss of faith in the 
listener will open his eyes (line 42).

            WHAT IS THIS, THAT STANDS BEFORE ME?
            FIGURE IN BLACK, WHICH POINTS AT ME
            TURN ROUND QUICK AND START TO RUN
            FIND OUT I'M THE CHOSEN ONE.  OH, NO!
            
            BIG BLACK SHAPE WITH EYES OF FIRE
            TELLING PEOPLE THEIR DESIRE
            SATAN'S SITTING THERE, HE'S SMILING
            WATCHES THOSE FLAMES GET HIGHER AND HIGHER
            OH, NO, NO, -- PLEASE GOD HELP ME!
            
                IS THIS THE END MY FRIEND?
                SATAN'S COMING 'ROUND THE BEND
                PEOPLE RUNNING 'CAUSE THEY'RE SCARED
                THE PEOPLE BETTER GO AND BEWARE
                NO, NO!  PLEASE--NO!!
                
                
    The all time controversy winner!  Is this not irrefutably  THE song about 
Black Magic in rock?  It's all so obvious, suffuse with evil imagery; Satan, 
walls of flame, figure in black, and damnation at the end.  Yes, I see the 
images too; it definitely concerns Black Magic.  Then again, Shakespeare's 
Macbeth employed scenes of witches involved in conjurations; does that mean 
that Shakespeare was a warlock?  Poe used to write sardonic tragedies about 
twisted murderers and the bizarre nature of acts, did that make him an evil, 
leering, demented killer?  Did either of them advocated what they wrote about?  
One has to remember that writing about something is not necessarily the same as 
emulating it.  Tony Iommi spoke out quite strongly about this:  ""People are 
bringing us down saying that we are a Black Magic group.  I think they must be










getting mixed up with Black Widow.  We don't do any sacrifices on stage, and 
we're not on a black magic kick.  We wanted to do heavy numbers and the guitar 
riffs we worked out were more suited to evil things than love.  We play songs 
about black magic, but they are more likely to be against than for it.""(12)  

    By now, you're probably asking yourself who Black Widow is, right?  Then 
it's time for a little history:

        Sabbath, before they were known as Sabbath, had the same line-up but 
two earlier names.  The first one was Polka Tulk, which seemed sure to doom 
them to obscurity.(13)  The soon realized this and changed the group's name to 
Earth.  Now, Earth was a blues band at the end of the English blues boom.  As 
if that wasn't bad enough, they soon discovered that not only was there another 
group named Earth, but they had also released a single.  To avoid confusion, 
they changed their name again.(14)  But what made them decide on that name?  
Just ask Ozzy:  ""I just liked the name Black Sabbath because of the succession 
of vowel sounds.(15)  If that sounds ludicrous just consider this:  Sabbath was 
""...the first of the really committed, loud and heavy bands...""(16)  They 
needed a name to match the gut-wrenching power they were developing.  Tony knew 
that he wanted Sabbath to be noticed above all the rest of the British blues 
bands:  ""We wanted something of our own that we'd like and people would like.  
And we wanted something loud!""










    Tony didn't hate the blues.  He'd cut his teeth as a guitarist on the likes 
of The Shadows, Buddy Holly and Django Rheinhardt, developing his own style 
from there.  But he realized the group had no future in the blues:

        'We couldn't keep playing 12-bars forever.  We just got fed up with 
Earth music.  It was jazz, blues stuff.  It was good for practice but nothing 
else.'

    In the late 'Sixties, blues groups were a dime a dozen in Birmingham and 
interest was waning in the blues boom due to the glut of groups.  One man, by 
the name of Jim Simpson, had heard Earth around the Birmingham club circuit and 
understood what they were trying to do.  He decided to take them under his 
wing.  With the aid of his massive record collection, Jim expanded the group's 
horizons in the areas of jazz and blues.  He introduced them to artists like 
Wes Montgomery, Count Basie and Jimmy Rushing.  It was from Rushing in 
particular that they derived the repetitive riff style so readily noticeable in 
their later incarnation as Black Sabbath.

    The Count Basie influence is evidenced in the song ""Wicked World"" from the 
first album; Sabbath drummer Bill Ward uses a ""'sighing hi-hat'...in the manner 
of Basie's drummer Jo Jones.""










    The influence is subtle, almost subliminal.  Yet it is one which was not 
thought capable of hard, 'heavy' rock bands in the late 'Sixties.  Although Led 
Zeppelin and Jimi Hendrix also had their work steeped in blues and jazz 
derivations (Hendrix' ""Third Stone From the Sun"" and Zeppelin's version of 
Willie Dixon's ""I Can't Quit You Baby"" from their first album), neither was 
able to match the intense energy of Black Sabbath.  Iommi has always had a 
preference for music with an original, distinct style of its' own; as an 
example, he mentions guitarists Joe Pass and Alvin Lee as two of his strongest 
songwriting influences.

    It would also be necessary that Sabbath develop a unique, distinctive style 
and image of their own.  Though they had changed their name from Earth to Black 
Sabbath to avoid confusion with the other Earth; at the same time another group 
emerged by the name of Black Widow ""...who WERE profoundly influenced by the 
occult, had a male witch as a patron, and wrote pieces like ""Come to The 
Sabbat.""  Unfortunately, Sabbath was constantly reaping the benefits of Widow's 
publicity.

    Sabbath was a group that never minced words.  If they saw something as 
destructive, they would be sure to rub the listener's face it it.  They did not 
want their point to be missed.

    With their straightforward, sometimes brutal way of looking at things, they 
try to shock the listener's conscience back into awareness.  The imagery of 
""Hand of Doom"", from the Paranoid album, is candid and condemning; it is a 
strong statement against drug addiction and rightly so...

            LIFE'S REALITY
            
            PUSH THE NEEDLE IN,
            FACE DEATH'S SICKLY GRIN

            DEATH'S HANDS START TO WEAVE
            
            IT'S TO LATE TOO TURN
            YOU DON'T WANNA LEARN
            PRICE OF LIFE YOU CRY
            NOW YOU'RE GONNA DIE
            
            
    Many people felt the group's overall direction was pessimistic and had a 
negative effect on its listener's due to that.  ""Ozzy insisted that if people 
thought he was having a bad effect on the minds of young kids, they should go 
and watch the TV news where real murder and mayhem were a way of life, and 
shown night after night."" (18)

    Sabbath was never negative in their message; they were simply truthful 
about waht they saw as wrong in the world.  If you ""Strip away the horror 
stories, the imagery and the hysteria, (and) turn down the amps a notch...you 
have a well-rehearsed, solid blues and rock band, powered by a dedication to 
well defined objectives.""  On the top of the list of those objectives was 
truth; Sabbath never feared facing that truth squarely, regardless of what many 
people thought of them.

Long, long, time ago,
I can still remember,
When the local calls were ""free"".
And I knew if I paid my bill,
And never wished them any ill,
That the phone company would let me be...

But Uncle Sam said he knew better,
Split 'em up, for all and ever!
We'll foster competition:
It's good capital-ism!

I can't remember if I cried,
When my phone bill first tripled in size.
But something touched me deep inside,
The day... Bell System... died.

And we were singing...

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

Is your office Step by Step,
Or have you gotten some Crossbar yet?
Everybody used to ask...
Oh, is TSPS coming soon?
IDDD will be a boon!
And, I hope to get a Touch-Tone phone, real soon...

The color phones are really neat,
And direct dialing can't be beat!
My area code is ""low"":
The prestige way to go!

Oh, they just raised phone booths to a dime!
Well, I suppose it's about time.
I remember how the payphones chimed,
The day... Bell System... died.

And we were singing...

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

Back then we were all at one rate,
Phone installs didn't cause debate,
About who'd put which wire where...
Installers came right out to you,
No ""phone stores"" with their ballyhoo,
And 411 was free, seemed very fair!

But FCC wanted it seems,
To let others skim long-distance creams,
No matter 'bout the locals,
They're mostly all just yokels!

And so one day it came to pass,
That the great Bell System did collapse,
In rubble now, we all do mass,
The day... Bell System... died.

So bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

I drove on out to Murray Hill,
To see Bell Labs, some time to kill,
But the sign there said the Labs were gone.
I went back to my old CO,
Where I'd had my phone lines, years ago,
But it was empty, dark, and ever so forlorn...

No relays pulsed,
No data crooned,
No MF tones did play their tunes,
There wasn't a word spoken,
All carrier paths were broken...

And so that's how it all occurred,
Microwave horns just nests for birds,
Everything became so absurd,
The day... Bell System... died.

So bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

We were singing:

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?

And we sing in harmony!            But that's good enough for me!

There are those who worship science     I'll go get my golden sickle
And some would send 'em to the Lions    And I'll wear it where it tickles
But without 'em we'd have no appliance  It ain't used for cuttin' pickles!
So they're good enough for me!          And it's good enough for me!

In the church of Aphrodite                 John, Paul, George and Ringo
The Priestess wears a see through nightie  We will worship playing Bingo
She's a mighty righteous sightie,          We will listen to them sing-o
And she's good enough for me!              And that's good enough for me!

   ""This stuff is too damn sweet!""                        (16)

   When Setanta ascended the Eastern Throne
   He was nothing special to behold;
   Until he drank some Imperium Compound:
   Now he's a Playgirl centerfold!                        (16)

   When Setanta was the Crown Prince
   He wore garments of a sombre hue
   Then he tasted Imperium Compound
   And now he's berry, berry blue!                        (16)

   Imperium Compound is a manly brew
   As many a puissant Countess will assert!
   It makes you wonder about King Vissevald
   The King who wears a skirt!                            (16)

   Vissevald is King of the Eastland
   Drinks Imperium Compound by the quart
   He likes it so much he's never noticed
   We now wear daggers into Court!                        (16)

   Vissevald and his Lady Mara
   Danced ""La Volta"" through the night;
   He drank too deep of Imperium Compound,
   And she's now a satellite!                             (16)

   Gavin Kilkenny asked ""Is there any-
   One who would dispute my rightful Throne?
   I'll take a double Imperium Compound,
   For it seems I have a clone!""                          (16)

   AElfwine the Saxon, whose family's flaxen
   Whose courtesy is all the Northland's pride;
   Mixes his mead now with Imperium Compound
   Often a bridesmaid, now a bride!                       (16)

   Siegfried, thrice King, showed us a new thing
   When fighting for the Eastern Crown:
   He took a swig of Imperium Compound
   And proved you CAN win from one-down!                  (16)

   Richard of Mont Roy-al, the Short he
   Is very fast and very hard to kill;
   As tall as Frodo, or his dog, Odo,
   But he kisses Froggies with a will!                     (5)

   Duke Sir Deaton, was never beaten
   On the field, or in the drinking hall;
   At the Catbox War with Caid,
   Left thirty bodies piled against the wall!              (5)

   Denis O'Titans was good at smitin'
   A Locksley Monster in every single way!
   Drank a little Imperium Compound
   And ATE Deaton's sword that day  // No! REALLY! //       (5)

   Wotan the Mongoloid, a little bit paranoid,
   But a nice guy none the less;
   Drank a mess of Imperium Compound
   Now he's Justin du Roc, I confess!                       (5)

10
   Then there's Duke Reynard, with a face like a St. Bernard
   Of the Dukes, he is the homliest
   He tends to toke up on Imperium Compound
   And go out and whomp on anybody's best!                   

   Oh, Ebenezer, thought he was Julius Caesar
   So they put him in the Funny Home.
   Then they gave him Imperium Compound,
   Now he's Emperor of Rome.
                 
   AltChorus: Oh let's drink a drink, a drink, a drink,  
              To Lily the Pink, the Pink, the Pink,
              The savior of the human ra-aa-ace.
              She invented Imperium Compound,
              Most effacatious in evr'y case.

   There was Horic, We thought he was sick,
   As a War-Puppy he was insane,
   Gave up Tranya for Imperium Compound,
   Now we have an Acid Reign!            //Oh wow, man!//   (18)

   This song'll bedevil the folks at a revel,
   And most of the time it will annoy the King,
   So take a drink of Imperium Compound
   And let's go Royalty-bedeviling!                         (5)

   Duchess Anna is quite a fan-a
   Going on a wartime shopping spree!  \\ War Point!\\
   Took a drink of Imperium Compound
   And shopped so fast we couldn't see! \\ Z-o-o-o-om!\\    (5)

   Lyn of Whitewolfe, made of the right stuff,
   Twice the Queen of Atenveldt;
   Took a drink of Imperium Compound
   And the Kingdom of Caid before her knelt!                (5)

   Duke Sir Brion, and Duke Sir Trelon,
   Won the Crown with regularity;
   Drank a lot of Imperium Compound,
   And founded a dynasty!                                   (5)

   Stephan von Geist, was most awful nice,
   And a chivalrous fighter without any doubt
   Took a swig of Imperium Compound
   And won the Crown his first time out!                    (5)

   All the Crusadenes were big, but not mean,
   And the finest fighters in the town.
   But they all drank Jerusalem Compound,
   Winning Crown after Crown after Crown!                   (5)

   Good Duke Arthur couldn't get no farth-er
   A Norman King in Aten Land
   Drank too much of Imperium Compound
   And went off to conquer Engel-land!                      (5)

   Then King Richard, a bit of a bitch, heard
   A King's Crown could be done.
   Drank a little Imperium Compound
   And became the Aten King, first one!                     (5)
11
   There was Astra, no one ever asked her
   And she was for having fun!
   Then she sampled Imperium Compound,
   And today she is a nun   \\ not better!\\               (19)

   There's good old Igor, his prowess is meager
   For he never learned to water-ski!
   But instead he drinks Imperium Compound
   Then he howls and climbs a tree!  \\Hoo Hah!\\          (19)

   Then there's Dagan, his brother's the Ka-Khan,
   Which is quite funny in a King!
   If he gets hooked on Imperium Compound
   There'll be new songs to sing!    \\ Oh, really?\\       (19)  

   Fredrick of Holland, who dwells in the Northland,
   A Master from the West, he came!
   Spends all his money for Imperium Compound
   That's why his garb's always the same!                   (20)

   Now Gyrth Oldcastle, round as a beer barrel,
   Once chose to quarrel with a certain Bard;
   The poet served him with Imperium Compound,
   And left him rendered down to lard!                      (20)

   Many tales abound of Imperium Compound
   And its' strange effects on Royalty,
   But after an hour, this song has no power,
   And by now, it's boring ME!                             (16)

   Duchess Malinda, who doesn't do windas
   But she does a lot of Duchess Things,
   But give her a LOT of Imperium Compound,
   And she sings and sings and sings and sings and sings!   (5)

   AltChorus: Oh it's too long, too long, too long
              To sing the whole song, the song, the song
              Longer than a Royal Court, it is!
              But sing it serial, this ditty Imperial
              And you'll be a bardic whiz!                 (5)

                                             IMPERIUM COMPOUND    
                                             (Atenveldt Verses)

   Now here's a story, a little bit gory,
   A little bit happy, a little bit sad.
   About a drink called Imperium Compound
   And how the SCA's been had!                       

   Chorus: Oh we think, we think, we think,
           The King is a fink, a fink, a fink,
           A figure of respectability
           Rules the Kingdom thru Imperium Compound
           The results are plain to see!

   Mongol Hordemen, those free-living swordsmen
   Subverting the Kingdoms from underneath!
   Have no use for Imperium Compound
   Except perhaps to brush their teeth!

   AltChorus: Oh we fink, we fink, we fink,
              The Khan and the Kink, the Kink, the Kink,
              And the Board, their Great Senilities!
              The Western Irgun, drinks Imperium Compound
              And we're BACK, with results you'll see!    

   Lady Laurel, with Authority Royal,
   Passes and rejects our heraldry
   She needs a swig of Imperium Compound
   Then perhaps she'd deign to talk to me!            

   Lady Trude thought it her duty
   To turn a social wrong into a Right
   Proved her point with Imperium Compound
   And showed that Cheshire Cats can fight!  //and scratch//

   The Board of Directors styled themselves The Electors
   And another con they tried to swing
   Now the BoD drinks Imperium Compound
   So we no longer need a King!                        

   AltChorus: Oh the Bod, the BoD, the BoD,
              It thinks it is God, is God, is God,
              The figure of Supreme Authority!
              And if we O.D.'d on Imperium Compund
              there'd be no need for Royalty!          

   Oh, MEDIEVAL Net, we thought it was all wet
   With witty remarks, and other kinds of sass
   We'll feed our computers on Imperium Compound
   And BYTE the BoD right on its' righteous ass!         

   Good old Duncan was often drunken
   Chasing all the ladies fair
   He bathed himself in Imperium Compound
   Now he has a little savoir faire!                     

                    (more)


  ATEN IMPERIUM (cont.)

   Ioseph of Locksley, never changes his socks, he
   Runs around looking like a Cavalier,
   He stocked up on Imperium Compound
   And he has enough to last for years and years!        

   AltChorus: Oh they forgot, forgot, forgot
              The Locks-e-ly Plot, the Plot, the Plot!
              And it works the best when it is underground!
              It isn't a hassle for a green-and-white tassle
              They're the ones that BREW Imperium Compound!  

   Trelon of the Wood, he was very good, he
   Was a leader that had never been beat before;
   But Caid had Imperium Compound,
   And Imperial Roman Caid won the War!  //with help!//   

   In Tyr Ysgithr, it's regularly whispered there
   That the Kingdom is ruled over by a King    // What's THAT? //
   They're ""democratic"" and quite erratic....
   They've forgot the purpose of the whole damn thing!     

   King Sir Mark von, with his pretty white suit on,
   Rules the Kingdom both with Grace and Purity!
   He never touches Imperium Compound
   At least not where anyone else can see!               

   Duke Sir Deaton, was never beaten
   On the field, or in the drinking hall;
   At the Catbox War with Caid,
   Left thirty bodies piled against the wall!             

   Denis O'Titans was good at smitin'
   A Locksley Monster in every single way!
   Drank a little Imperium Compound
   And ATE Deaton's sword that day  // No! REALLY! //

                          WTP-0002C

        Last night I had the strangest dream in this bleak century
        I dreamed that people the world around believed in Chivalry

        I dreamed I saw a Kingly Crown enshrined in laurel leaves
        with Grace and Joy and Purity attendant at his feet

        I dreamed I saw the perfect Knight receive his accolade
        and minstrels sang and children laughed in some soft forest glade

        I dreamed I saw the finest thing that ever man could make
        grow great and strong and undefiled: Pray God I never wake!

        Last night I had the strangest dream in this bleak century
        I dreamed that people the world around believed in Chivalry

               (to the tune of ""Good King Wenceslaus"")

                Locksley Monsters never yield
                on the field of battle
                strike the helm and bash the shield
                make their eyeteeth rattle
                Bodies on the ground will lie
                bones will burst in sunder
                search for Locksleys' enemies:
                You'll find them six feet under!

                              SONG OF IVANOF

            There is a man who we know well that does the best he can
            but he's displayed in armour made of reticulated garbage cans!

            He looks so fine and fair and strong, oh how he plays the man
            and how it's prized, those galvanized, reticulated garbage cans

            The noblest Roman of them all, a good Praetorian
            a combatant who wears no pants, judst reticulated garbage cans!

            Like old Horatius at the Bridge, like the Legions of Valerian
            (O dearie me: those LOVELY knees!)
            and those reticulated garbage cans!

                         C. McCray Bethancourt

         (sung to the tune (obviously) of the 12 Days of Christmas)


1.           The first time I sent my device, The Heralds said to me

            ""It violates the Rule of Three""

2.           The next time I tried it, the Heralds said to me

            ""We changed the forms, and it violates the Rule of
             Three"".

3.           The third time I tried, and the Heralds said to me, 

            ""We upped the fees, we changed the forms, and it
             violates the Rule of Three"".

4.           Another time I tried and the Heralds said to me,
 
            ""We haven't got it, we upped the fees, we changed the 
             forms, and it violates the Rule of Three"".

5.           The fifth time I tried it, the Heralds said to me,  

            ""In a decision rendered by the College of Arms on
             August 1st, A.S. V it was decided that this style of
             heraldic design was not appropriate to the aims and 
             intentions of the Corporate Body. Holy! Holy! Holy! ""

 note: verse 5 is delivered in an extremely fast, mono-
       tone, similiar to a Gregorian Chant.

           "" ....we haven't got it, we upped the fees, we changed the forms,
             and it violates the Rule of Three.""

6.           I tried it a sixth time, and the Heralds said to me,

            ""We changed the rules, &c""

7.           A seventh time I tried and, the Heralds said to me,

            ""It's against the Rule of Tincture, we changed the
             rules, &c""

8.           I tried it once again and the heralds said to me,

            ""It's not a Period design, It's against the Rule of Tincture, We
             changed the rules, &c""

                                * more *



    Heralds Said To Me (cont.)

9.           I sent it in once more, and the Heralds said to me,

            ""We changed the rules again, It's not a Period design,
             it's against the Rule of Tincture, we changed the
             rules, &c""

10. (sung in cold anger)
             The LAST time I sent my device, the Heralds said to me

    (sung in a state of SMUG)
             ""Someone else has got it, &c""




              (nb: every single one of these reasons has been used by the
              CoA, at one point or another, to reject perfectly good
              heraldry, along with some even MORE stupid.  If the shoe 
              fits....................!!!!!!!!)

           or: Who was that Vermin I saw you with last, Knight?
   or: There may be Lice on all you Knice, but there ain't no Lice on me

           Once there was a Barony howling in the wilderness
           nestled in the Valley where the River doesn't flow
           and the folks were driven buggy by the insects in the Revel Hall
           Authenticity is wonderful, but this doesn't go!

                   Bugs on the Baroness, bugs on the Baroness!
                   That was the cry that you heard all the day
                   and the scratching can be heard from Ysgithr to Ered Sul
                   why did we come here? Let's go away!

           See them all a scratching, nestled in their armour tight
           the fleas have a melee team that's challenging the field!
           call Truly Nolen! Someone's gotta help us out!
           the crabs are nesting in our helms but we'll never yield!

                   (chorus)

           Dawn comes a-breaking, the bugs have won the Coronet...
           flea-infested Conan-clones in piles upon the lawn
           where is the Barony? The bugs have eaten everyone...
           termites got the stick-jocks, and all their sticks are gone!

                   (chorus)

                  For all the Lands where I have dwelt
                  Oh Atenveldt, Oh Atenveldt
                  till rivers burn and mountains melt
                  lest I forget my Atenveldt
                  From deserts stark to snow-capped peaks
                  from silent lakes and laughing creeks
                  sing: Oh let man find his heart's ease
                  on rocky plains
                  in desert breeze

                  For oft I thought of mighty men
                  who carved a Land with sword and pen
                  and lit a candle, burning bright,
                  that pierced the darkness; stirred the night!
                  tho some are gone their deeds remain
                  this sunny Crown without a stain
                  sing: Oh, their deeds were not in vain!
                  in sunlit days

                  So raise your banners, blazoned bright
                  Advance the Dream and Shine the Light!
                  in battle's crash and Revel's song
                  raise high the Flag and wave it long!
                  For all the Lands wherein I've dwelt
                  I love you best, my Atenveldt!
                  Sing: Oh the Joy that I have felt!

      What the use of wearing panties
      whalebone corsets of your Auntie's
      boxer shorts and other scanties
      best of all is nude
      there's such fun in going bra-less
      now that it's no longer lawless
      'specially if your figure's flawless
      best of all is nude
      nude is what you're born in
      shirts are never torn in
      underwear and lacy flimsies, garter belts and other whimsies
      yards of itchy cloth to put your form in
      ducks all do it, maidens rue it
      even ancient Picts in Britain blue it
      going naked's how to do it
      best of all is nude!

      If your garters aren't elastic
      tie them up in knots fantastic
      (panty hose is something drastic!)
      best of all is nude!
      If you're tired of wearing clotheses
      shed your garment 'mongst the roses
      never mind the old bluenoses
      best of all is nude!
      Nude is best for ducking!
      Worst for horses bucking!
      Moonlit nights will see such sights
          that are very best for fooling round
                              .....and elbows!
      Nudity is grand to see
       a well-known antidote to virginity
      take your clothes off and you'll see:
      best of all is nude!

                   once I talked to a great Grey Man
                   spun three times and said with a sigh
                   hadn't been for the Runes had his other eye!

                   prettiest thing I've ever seen
                   she went down underneath the hill
                   and came back out of her own free will

                   Brian Boru, on Irish ground
                   walked three times the Island round
                   Norsemen came lookin for a fight
                   just another Irish Saturday night!

                   Hi said Lugh on the banquest night
                   a poet and a player and a good wheelwright
                   a harper and a warrior and none the least:
                   a Druid and he got in to the Feast!

                   Harold Haardrada's face was red!

                   got six feet of English ground

                   the Legion with it's Eagles bright
                   marched into the Pictish night
                   met them there upon the sand
                   gave em up to the Wicker Man!

                   Present is Past and Past is Me!

                   Rhiannon's Birds are still in flight

                   Hi said the Lady dressed in white
                   sang the Day and sang the Night
                   sang the Land and sang the Sea
                   sang the Song, and then sang Me!

                                  came the Lady to the lea
                                  Sword and Roses in Her Hand
                                  spread their seeds thruout the Land

                                  saw the Lady where she stood
                                  by the fire burning bright
                                  came to know his heart's delight!

                    WEAPONS AT THE DOOR

 Being a Polemic concerning the alleged Custom of the West Kingdom concerning 
 checking your Weapons at the Door of the Revel Hall. As the Satire is the 
 Weapon of the Bard, this said Polemic is to be checked at the Door, along with 
 swords, knives, redheaded Ladies and other such Deadly Things.....

         As I roved out to Western Lands to take the Western Air
         I went into a Revel Hall and I saw a Twelfth Night there
         but I was halted at the gate by a Privy Consellor
                 (that's the man who tells the King of the West how to go to
                  the bath room!)
         who told me I would have to check my Weapons at the door

         As I, in my astonishment, stood hung on tenter-pegs
         a Knight came in whose Prouess hung down between his legs
         the Doorman grabbed a greatsword and he struck the Knight full sore
         and gave him a reciept; he left his weapon at the door!

         a Bard was next whose goodly Voice has entertained us all
         but he, too, was prevented from entering the Hall
         and told he could not carry deadly weapons on the floor
         he left his Voice and Harp among the weapons at the door

         a Master entered graciously, a man we all know well
         who holds a 3rd Dan Black Belt, tho this he'd never tell
         the Master struggled valiantly, the Master cursed and swore
         but he left his hands, and feet, as weapons at the door

         the company was jovial, altho a bit dismayed
         for lack of proper cutlery, down to the smallest blade
         for even teeth and fingernails, each can be used in War
         were cut, and pulled, and left behind, as weapons at the door!

         And has their King not loyal Knights that He must be afraid
         of brawling in his Hall and of Assassin's bloody blade?
         the Rights of Men to carry Arms at least WE'VE not foreswore
         and a POX on them that made the Rule of Weapons at the Door!

                           THE STREETS OF ANN ARBOR

               As I walked out thru the streets of Ann Arbor
               as I walked out thru Ann Arbor one day
               I spied a young Mongol all dressed in white linen
               all dressed in white linen and cold as the clay

               I then spied another, done in on the sidewalk
               along with just about six dozen more
               their wounds were all gaping, from mace and from braoadsword
               from claymore and cannon, all dripping with gore

               what caused this grave carnage, I cried to the Monglos
               oh pray what's the reason for this awful sight
               my answer came slowly from under the corpse-pile
               ""It seems that our bark is much worse than our bite.....""

               the answer continued from pale lips a-shaking
               we sang all our songs and believed them as true
               the Dark Horde could never be beaten in battle
               we thought this was what all good Mongols could do...

               we went down to Atenveldt all for to plunder
               ""too large to defend"" was our song every night
               but Atenveldt's different from East, West or Middle
               there, even the bushes have learned how to bite!

               the Clann stole our ponies, the Scraelings our foodstuffs
               we ran into axes in AtenViking hands
               our maidens ran off with one Richard of Arkham
               and we're all that's left to return to our lands

               MacChluarains and Monsters, Lockehaven and Foxmoor
               that Kingdom is BIG and its' fighters are MEAN!
               we fought and we lost, and fled back to Ann Arbor
               we all came back home with results that you've seen

               keep away from that Land with its' cactus and marshes
               it's no place for Mongols who are bent on War
               they count their blows well, but they strick them yet better
               he crawled into his Yurt, and fell, dead, on the floor.....

       tune: the song of the Cowardly Lion, Tin Woodsman and Scarecrow
             in the movie version of the Wizard of Oz

        (Enter the Scarecrow, who singeth:)

        My wife is always nagging; my Prowess it is lagging
        I can't do anything
        she has got a reason, but revenge is out of season
        Oh I wish I could be King!

        If I just had the Crown on, I'd always have a frown on
        and the Barons on a string
        Heads they would be rolling, the Board would be cajoling
        Oh if only I was King!

        I am very fed up with the way this group is set up
        Oh I'd change everything!
        they are so high and mighty with the way that they do fight-ey
        Oh, someday I'll be King!

        Tho my wife is melancholic, and very...vitriolic
        she's a wasp without a sting!
        I'd have to supervise her with a pack of tranquilizers
        If I only was a King......

        (the Tin Woodsman joineth him, and singeth:)

        I grew up kind of cocky, and rather big, and stocky
        and straight as any rod
        on the field I'm a battallion, with the Ladies I'm a stallion
        ...Oh they'd better make me God!

        The other boys are jealous they say I'm over-zealous
        they'd do better to applaud
        the things that I am giving to this Dream that we are living
        oh I wish they'd make me God!

        They say that I'm conceited, but I'm just badly treated
        by people and by BoD
        just think of what they're missing by My Majesty dismissing
        Oh they'd better make me God!

        (the Cowardly Lion creepeth forth, and singeth:)

        Oh I could be a fighter, a great and mighty smiter
        and be the perfect knight
        it's a great and nasty shame, and everyone's to blame
        oh I wish that I could fight!

        Song of the Three (cont.)

        I could be a Cavalier drinking wine and ale and beer
        and be a gorgeous sight
        but it would cost me too much money so it isn't very funny
        oh I wish that I could fight!                               

        Let me at 'em on the field, I would surely make them yield
        to my Power and my Might
        with rattan, shinai and rapier they would nevermore escape here
        If they'd only let me fight

                She was afraid to come out to the Tourney
                She was worried that ""something might show..""
                She was afraid to come out to the Tourney
                And the poor thing did NOT want to go...

                  (2 - 3 - 4, tell the people what she wore!)

                One day in the Kingdom of the Middle
                It happened at a Tourney one day:
                The Mongols invaded the Middle
                But the Middle did not want to play...

                  (eins - zwei - drei, but the Dark Horde wouldn't die!)

                      by William Poundstone
                              1983

     Two mentalities are at work here: 1960s rock fans and 1980s
fundamentalist Christians. The idea of phonographically concealed
messages dates from the Paul McCartney death scare of 1969. For
hard-core types, the secret-message rumors never really died. Avid
rock fans have auditioned ever album release since the late 1960s
for hidden nuances. Backward messages, barely audible messages,
and messages on one stereo track only have been alleged. At the
other end of the sociosensual spectrum, fundamentalist Christians
have gotten into the act. TV programs such as PRAISE THE LORD and
THE 700 CLUB have propagated rumors of a satanic plot in the
recording industry, no less, in which various albums conceal
""backward-masked"" demonic murmurings. If THAT sounds too spacey to
be taken seriously, consider that it was the fundamentalist groups
who were behind House Resolution 6363, a bill introduced in the
U.S. House of Representatives by Robert K. Dornan (R., Calif.) in
1982 to label all suspect records: ""WARNING: THIS RECORD CONTAINS
BACKWARD MASKING THAT MAKES A VERBAL STATEMENT WHICH IS AUDIBLE
WHEN THIS RECORD IS PLAYED BACKWARD AND WHICH MAY BE PERCEPTIBLE
AT A SUBLIMINAL LEVEL WHEN THIS RECORD IS PLAYED FORWARD."" In
February 1983, the Arkansas State Senate passed a similar record-
labeling bill by a vote of 86 to 0.
     Contributing to the quasi-occult status of these rumors is
the difficulty of checking them out on home audio equipment. You
pretty much have to take someone else's word for it, or dismiss
the rumors out of hand.
     From a technical standpoint, there are four simple ways to
conceal a verbal message on a recording. The most obvious is to
record the message at a very low volume. The message may then be
recovered by turning the volume up while playing the record or
tape. If the message is faint enough, though, noise levels of home
equipment may garble it. If the accompanying music or lyrics are
loud enough, or if the message itself is indistinct or
electronically modified, it may be hard to hear on any equipment.
     A second gimmick is to record a message on one stereo track
only. Records and tapes have two independent recordings, of
course, normally played simultaneously for stereo effect. On a
record, each stereo track occupies on one side of the V-shaped
groove for the needle. On a tape, the tracks are recorded in
parallel lanes of the magnetic material. The two tracks are called
""right"" and ""left"" after the stereo speakers they will play on.
Otherwise, the tracks are interchangeable -- the sound mixer can
put anything he or she wants on each track. A message on one track
can be masked by simultaneous loud music or lyrics on the opposite
track. With normal stereo balance (or mono equipment) the loud
track drowns out the message track. At home, single-track messages
can be recovered by adjusting the stereo balance so that only the
desired track plays. Sometimes this trick also makes indistinct
words clearer. Even if the words are not exclusively on one track,
they may happen to be more audible on one track.
     A message could be recorded at a speed different from the
rest of the record. Then the record would have to be played faster
or slower than usual to recover the message. Unless the message
was at one of the standard speeds (say, 45 rpm on a 33 1/3 rpm
record), it could not be played normally on home equipment.
     The fourth and most commonly alleged trick is to record a
verbal message backward. Reversed speech has several unexpected
features. One is that syllables are not a constant in the reversal
process. A one-syllable word can have two or three syllables when
played backward. Thus ""number nine"" in the Beatles' REVOLUTION 9
reverses to ""Turn me on, dead man"" (or something like it), a jump
from three to five syllables.
     There is no simple way to predict what a word or phrase will
sound like reversed. Obviously, you can't just reverse the
letters.
     Reversed messages are difficult to recover at home. Record
turntables are not built to go backwards. Some have a neutral
setting, in which the pickup and amplifier remain active and you
can turn the record backward by hand. But hardly anyone has a
stead enough hand to produce satisfactory results.
     With patience, it is possible to reverse a cassette
recording. Transfer the music from the original record or tape
onto a blank tape cassette. Place the cassette flat on a table.
Draw our the part of the tape with the suspected message and snip
it off at both ends. Hold the tape segment horizontally. Rotate it
180 degrees, keep it horizontal at all times. This turns the tape
end for end. Splice the reversed tape segment back onto the two
loose ends of the cassette with strong adhesive tape. Reel the
tape back inside the cassette. The sliced segment will play
backward on an ordinary cassette player.
     I rented a recording studio to test the secret-message
rumors. New copiies of the records in question were transcribed on
a quarter-inch master tape. Where rumor alleged that a single
stereo track contained a message, right and left stereo tracks
were transcribed separately. Records with alleged inaudible
messages were treated similarly. To test claims of reversed
messages, recordings on the master tape were edited out and
spliced in backward. Twenty cuts or portions of cuts from sixteen
albums were tested.


""Another One Bites the Dust""
Queen, THE GAME

Rumor: When played backward, the lyrics say, ""It's fun to smoke
marijuana.""
Findings: There is something that sounds like ""It's fun to smoke
marijuana"" in the reversed music. It is repeated over and over. It
might be rendered no less faithfully, however, as ""sfun to scout
mare wanna."" This ""message"" is the reversal of the song title,
which is repeated as a line in the song.
     Let's make a distinction between engineered and phonetic
reversals. When an artist records a verbal statement, reverses it
by turning the tape end for end, mixes the reversed statement onto
a master tape, and has records and tapes produced from the master,
that is an engineered reversal. When the phonetic properties of
song lyrics are such that they can be reversed to sound like
something else, that is a phonetic reversal.
     ""It's fun to smoke marijuna"" is clearly a phonetic reversal.
The lyrics are perfectly plain played forward (""Another one bites
the dust""), no so plain played backward (""sfun to scout mare
wanna""). With an engineered reversal, the opposite should hold
true: gibberish forward, clear as a bell backward. Some are
prepared to believe that phonetic reversals are just as
intentional as engineered reversals -- that the songwriter
painstakinginly planned the phonetic double-entendre. In the
absence of confirming evidence, that just doesn't wash. It's too
easy to find coincidences. If, for example, the letters of the
alphabet are recited in conventional fashion (Ay, Bee, Cee, etc.)
and reversed, at least five sound like English language words. D
reverses to ""eden,"" F becomes ""pray,"" S becomes ""say,"" V becomes
""even,"" and Z becomes ""easy."" ""It's fun to smoke marijuana"" is
likewise a coincidence.


""A Child is Coming""
Jefferson Starship, BLOWS AGAINST THE EMPIRE

Rumor: When played backward, ""son of Satan.""
Findings: Another phonetic coincidence. The repeated ""It's getting
better"" reverses to an iffy ""son of Satan,"" the ""of"" drawn out and
the ""Satan"" strongly accented on the first syllable.


""Eldorado""
Electric Light Orchestra, ELDORADO

Rumor: When played backward, ""He is the nasty one/ Christ, you're
infernal/ It is said we're dead men/ Everyone who has the mark
will live.""
Findings: Coincidence. The supposed message lurks around the line
""On a voyage of no return to see."" Reversed, this passage becomes
the expected syllable salad -- no one hearing it would describe it
as anything but reversed music. Only if you listen while reading
along with what you're supposed to hear will you get anything. The
rumored version of the message is somewhat fudged. The passage
sounds more like ""He's to nasty one/ Christ you are, Christ,
you're fernal/ There wiss uh, we're dead men..."" There is no ""in""
in what is taken to be ""infernal."" The line that is supposed to be
""Everyone who has the mark will live"" isn't even close, though the
syllable count is right.


""Shoo Be Doo""
The Cars, CANDY-O

Rumor: When played backward, the word ""Satan"" repeated
approximately eleven times.
Findings: Coincidence. The rumor refers to the reversal of the ""Shoo
be doo, shoo be doo, shoo be doo..."" near the end of the song. Given
the mysterious logic of reversed phonemes, these three-syllable units
can be hard as a repeated two-syllable word. The word sounds a little
like ""Satan.""


""Snowblind""
Styx, PARADISE THEATER

Rumor: According to a mimeographed list of suspect records distributed
by Congressman Dornan, the words ""Satan move through our voices"" when
played backwards.
Findings: Negative. Despite repeated listenings, it was not even
possible to identify the part of the reversed track that Dornan et al.
are talking about.


""Stairway to Heaven""
Led Zeppelin, untitled, a.k.a. STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN

Rumor: In reverse, ""I live for Satan... The Lord turns me off...
There's no escaping it... Here's to my sweet Satan... There's power in
Satan... He will give you 666.""
Findings: Coincidence. If you listen very carefully to the ""And it
makes me wonder"" lines in reverse, you'll hear something approaching
""There's no escaping it."" A better description is ""There's no escape
do."" Knock of the last syllable, and you have ""There's no escape,"" a
complete, intelligible sentence in reverse. It's there, all right, but
it's not an unlikely enough coincidence to -- well, make you wonder.
      The ""Satan"" in ""I live for Satan"" is good and clear. The ""I live
for"" part isn't. The other alleged lines are unremarkable. All are
phonetic reversals of the entirely lucid forward lyrics and obviously
just accidents.


""When Electricity Came to Arkansas""
Black Oak Arkansas, BLACK OAK ARKANSAS and RONCH AND ROLL

Rumor: In reverse, ""Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan. He is God. He
is God.""
Findings: The BLACK OAK ARKANSAS cut was reversed. Again, pairs of
reversed syllables are being freely interpreted as ""Satan."" ""He is
God"" was not identifiable.


""Rain""
The Beatles, HEY JUDE

Rumor: Unintelligible lyrics at the end are reversed.
Findings: A true engineered reversal and not really a secret. ""Rain""
seems to have been the first popular recording to incorporate an
obviously reversed lyric. The story is that John Lennon accidentally
spliced the last part of the song in backward and liked the effect.
When reversed, the strange-sounding vocals at the end become
intelligible as a reprise starting with the drawn-out word
""sunshine.""
      The reversal is less apparent to the casual listener than it
might be because the accompanying music is not reversed. The ending
fits in smoothly with the rest of the song, the vocals suggesting a
foreign language.


""Fire on High""
Electric Light Orchestra, FACE THE MUSIC

Rumor: When played backward, ""The music is reversible, but time --
turn back!""
Findings: ""Fire on High"" is instrumental. About twenty-six seconds
into the music, scrambled speech is heard. It is mostly louder than
the accompanying music and begins with a two-syllable unit repeated
several times. The seeming speech lasts for about fourteen seconds.
      Reversing the music confirms that there is a true, engineered
message. In reverse, a voice (Jeff Lynne's?) says, ""The music is
reversible, but time -- turn back! Turn back! Turn back! Turn back!""
All the words are clear and unambiguous. Anyone comparing this to the
alleged reversal on ELO's ""Eldorado"" will have no trouble telling
which is genuine.


""Goodbye Blue Sky""
Pink Floyd, THE WALL

Rumor: In reverse, ""You have discovered the secret message.""
Findings: The ""secret message"" is at the very end of the instrumental
passage following the ""Goodbye Blue Sky"" vocals. It comes just before
the words ""What shall we do"" at the start of the song that is
identified as ""Empty Spaces"" on the record label and as ""What shall we
do now?"" on the record sleeve. Played forward, the message is less
apparent than the FACE THE MUSIC reversal: A reasonably attentive
listener might play THE WALL through and not catch it. It suggests
speech not quite close enough to be overheard. In context this is not
unusual because the ""Goodbye Blue Sky"" instrumental passage includes
""airport noises"" and other sound effects. A loud climax in the music
further masks the unintelligible voice.
      When played backward, the voice (Roger Waters?) plainly intones,
""Congratulations, you have just discovered the secret message. Please
send your answer to old Pink, care of the funny farm..."" As the voice
fades out, there may be another word -- perhaps ""Chalfonte or
""Chelsea"" -- after ""funny farm.""


""Heavy Metal Poisoning""
Styx, KILROY WAS HERE

Rumor: A red sticker on the KILROY WAS HERE cover warns, ""By order of
the Majority for Musical Morality, this album contains secret backward
messages...""
Findings: This is a case of second-generation backward-masking. Styx'
PARADISE THEATER did not contain a backward message, though a lot of
people said it did. So Styx has included a sure enough backward
message on KILROY WAS HERE. It is at the very beginning of ""Heavy
Metal Poisoning."" The reversed speech last about three seconds. There
is no musical background. The words reverse to ""Annuit coeptis. Novus
ordo seclorum."" This is the Latin motto encircling the pyramid on the
back of a dollar bill. The usual translation: ""God has favored our
undertakings. A new order of the ages.""
      The cover sticker's ""Majority for Musical Morality"" is a
fictitious Falwellesque group in the KILROY WAS HERE video. Although
the sticker suggests a plurality of ""messages,"" only one was found.


Space between ""I'm So Tired"" and ""Blackbird""
The Beatles, untitled, a.k.a. THE WHITE ALBUM

Rumor: A reversed message. At the time of the Paul-is-dead stories,
the segue from ""I'm So Tired"" to ""Blackbird"" was offered as evidence.
It was held to contain John Lennon's voice, reveresed, saying ""Paul is
dead, miss him, miss him, miss him."" That interpretation seems
unlikely now, but there is a mysterious low muttering between the
songs.
Findings: The mumbling is actually just to the ""I'm So Tired"" side of
the shiny ""space"" between cuts on the record. Each of the stereo
tracks was recorded separately, twice, and a copy of each track was
reversed. This produced four versions of the two-second passage: right
forward, left forward, right reversed, and left reversed. All were
equally unintelligible. It was not even apparent whether the voice is
forward or reversed. Nor could John Lennon be identified as the
speaker. There are nine or ten syllables. The first six (when played
forward) are a two-syllable unit repeated three times. There is little
or no difference betwen the stereo tracks. Any claimed interpretation
of the sounds seems doubtful.


""Strawberry Fields Forever""
The Beatles, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR

Rumor: It was, of course, claimed that John Lennon says ""I buried
Paul"" at the end. (It's forward, at the very end after the music
fades to complete silence, returns, and starts to fade out again.)
But Lennon told ROLLING STONE that the words are ""cranberry
sauce.""
Findings: They are ""cranberry sauce."" The ""sauce""/""Paul"" part is
indistinct, but the first syllable sounds a lot more like ""cran""
than ""I.""


""Baby You're a Rich Man""
The Beatles, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR

Rumor: On one of the tracks the line ""Baby you're a rich man too""
is sung as ""Baby you're a rich fag Jew,"" a dig at Brian Epstein.
Or some think it's ""rich fat Jew"" and claim it as evidence of
Beatle anti-Semitism.
Findings: Negative. The two stereo tracks are nearly identical.
It's always possible to hear words as similar-sounding words, but
basically, the lyrics jibe with the published version.


""Revolution 9""
The Beatles, untitled, a.k.a. THE WHITE ALBUM

Rumor: Various reversed and/or one-track speech. The reversal of
""Number nine"" to ""Turn me on, dead man"" has pretty much been
discounted as coincidence (though it appears on Congressman
Dornan's list).
Findings: Distinction between lyrics and any hidden message blurs
on ""Revolution 9."" The eight-minute cut is a montage of sounds
collected by John Lennon and Yoko Ono. It includes discordant
music, radio broadcasts, sirens, applause, gunfights, sports
cheers, the crackling of a fire, screams, a baby gurgling, a choir
singing, and much that cannot be identified. For this
investigation, ""Revolution 9"" was transcribed four times, twice on
each stereo channel. One copy of each of the tracks was reversed.
The four resulting versions were compared with each other and
against the original two-channel version.
     ""Revolution 9"" contains a lot of talking. Played in stereo,
forward, the longest stretch of understandable speech is probably
an announcer saying, ""...every one of them knew that as time went
by they'd get a little bit older and a little bit slower...""
     One believable instance of reversed speech occurs: someone
saying ""Let me out! Let me out!"" (once held to represent McCartney
in his totaled Aston-Martin). Two iffy reversals occur on the
backward recording of the right stereo track:""She used to be
assistant"" and ""There were two men..."" Neither is clear enough or
long enough to be convincing. Some of the music, including the
recurring theme, sounds more natural in reverse.
     ""Turn me on, dead man"" is a typical phonetic reversal. The
forward ""number nine"" (repeated throughout the cut) is clear; the
reversal is slurred -- something like ""turn me on dedmun."" It has
been claimed that ""number nine"" must be pronounced with a British
accent or with some careful inflection in order to reverse to
""Turn me on, dead man."" This seems not to be so. As an experiment,
three American-accent renderings of ""number nine"" were reversed.
All sound about as much like ""Turn me on, dead man"" as the record
did. Like the other phonetic reversals, ""Turn me on, dead man""
must be considered a coincidence.
     Much of ""Revolution 9"" is on one stereo track only. Near the
end a voice says ""A fine natural imbalance...the Watusi...the
twist...Eldorado...Eldorado."" ""A fine natural imbalance"" is on the
right track only, though the words that follow are in stereo. One
of the longer bits of speech -- ""Who could tell what he was
saying? His voice was low and his [unintelligible] was high and
his eyes were low"" -- is clear on the left track, a bare whisper
on the right.
     There is a stereophonically concealed ""secret message"" on
""Revolution 9."" The words are on the right track. They begin about
four minutes, fifty-eight seconds into the cut and run for about
twenty-two seconds. They are not likely to be noticed in stereo
because of the much louder left track. The sound of applause
begins on the left track at about five minutes, one second into
the cut. Deafening noises -- the clapping, sirens, music --
continue on the left track until five minutes, forty seconds. It
may or may not have been Lennon's and Ono's intention to conceal
the spoken passage. Given the haphazard quality of ""Revolution 9,""
the concealment may have been accidental. To recover the passage,
the left track must be switched off. The right track can then be
heard to contain a sound like a stopwatch ticking, behind these
words:

     So the wife called, and we better go to see a
     surgeon....[A SCREAM MUFFLES A LINE THAT SOUNDS LIKE
     Well, what with the prices, the prices have snowballed,
     no wonder it's closed.] ...So any and all, we went to
     see the dentist instead, who gave him a pair of teeth,
     which wasn't any good at all. So instead of that he
     joined the bloody navy and went to sea.
                      by William Poundstone
                              1986

     There really are backward messages on rock albums. And the
controversy over ""backward masking"" and ""porn rock"" has inspired a
whole new spate of messages. There may have been more genuine
backward messages in the past few years than ever before.
     The backward message controversy is usually traced to the
1960s and John Lennon's avant-garde sound mixing on such tracks as
""Revolution 9"" on the Beatles' WHITE ALBUM. Lennon probably wasn't
trying to conceal a message so much as create an interesting
sound.
     The matter might have ended right there had it not been for
the Paul McCartney death rumor. College kids tried playing Beatles
records forward, backward, and at various speeds to find ""clues""
to McCartney's fate. In the process they found snippets of speech
from Lennon's experiments. Even after McCartney was found safe and
sound in Scotland, some listeners continued to look for hidden
messages.
     Somehow, fundamentalist Christian groups became convinced
(ca. 1982) that the alleged messages were commercials for devil
worship. Not a single indisputable satanic message has turned up,
but there were scattered attempts to ban or label certain albums.
In 1986 one fundamentalist group announced that the theme song for
the old MR. ED TV show contains the word ""Satan"" when played
backward.)
     Ironically, the publicity accorded nonexistent messages has
inspired several artists -- among them porn rock hearing witness
Frank Zappa -- to hide real background messages in their music.
It's easy to do.
     The performer speaks or sings the message normally, then
reverses the tape, which is mixed into the soundtrack. This is all
accomplished simply enough at any recording studio.
     What's not so simple is playing it back. More home record,
cassette, and compact disk players won't play backward. You can
turn a record backward with a pencil eraser, but it's not good for
the needle or the turntable. The only way to reproduce the message
with full fidelity is to use a professional-quality reel-to-reel
tape player and splice the tape in backward.
     We used the facilities of KLOS radio in Los Angeles to
reverse some recent records containing true backward messages.


""Secret Messages""
Electric Light Orchestra, SECRET MESSAGES

ELO's ELDORADO album was among those alleged to contain satanic
backward masked messages. A patient listening to ELDORADO played
backward reveals no such messages. You hear only what you ought to
hear -- the reversed lyrics of the songs, which sound nothing like
the ""messages"" claimed to be there. In the wake of such
allegations, ELO did put an (innocuous) backward message on their
FACE THE MUSIC album. Perhaps they thought this would show how
silly the allegations were. Instead, the backward-masking people
seized on this as proof that the other ""messages"" were real. In
the latest volley, ELO has named an album after the controversy.
     In Britain (where the backward-masking issue is viewed as an
American eccentricity), the cover of SECRET MESSAGES has a mock
warning label to youth about the hidden label. Word of the albums'
impending release in the United States caused enough of a furor to
chill CBS Records into deleting the cover blurb.
     The reversed message is easy to find. It's at the beginning
of the first song, which is itself called ""Secret Messages."" You
can hear reversed speech when you play the record normally. A
voice intones ""secret messages"" -- forward -- in the middle of the
reversed speech, lest anyone dare be so unhip as to not know
what's going on.
     We transferred a new copy of SECRET MESSAGES to reel-to-reel
tapes and played it backward. The backward message goes: ""WELCOME
TO THE BIG SHOW/ WELCOME TO THE BIG SHOW.""
     That's it.


""Ya Hozna""
Frank Zappa, THEM OR US

""Ya Hozna,"" a six-minute composition on the first record of the
THEM OR US double album, is ENTIRELY backward. The albums' inner
cover, which includes lyrics for the other songs, says, ""backwards
vocal -- you figure it out"" of this cut. It credits Frank and Moon
Zappa, George Duke, and Napoleon Murphy Brock as vocalists.
     Played forward, ""Ya Howza"" sounds like a record played
backward -- reasonably so. The vocals are prominent and
unintelligible. Moon Zappa's voice is curiously recognizable, even
in reverse. It is hard to tell whether the music was recorded
forward or backward.
     When ""Ya Howza"" is played in reverse, you discover that the
music is virtually a palindrome -- it sounds about the same
forward and backward. The voices are all backward. In some cases
they have been modified electronically. Many of the words are
muffled. Even after repeated careful listening on both stereo
tracks, it is difficult to make out many of the lyrics. It doesn't
help that some of the words seem to be stream-of-consciousness
nonsense. Some of the unintelligible stuff sounds like opera.
     Starting at the beginning of the reversed tape -- the end of
the forward tape -- the clearer vocals go like this: ""I am the
heaven, I am the water."" This is in a hymnlike register. ""You are
a lonely little girl./ But your mommy and your daddy hold you."" A
singsong synthesizer voice.
     The most interesting part of the lyrics is an intermittently
orgasmic rap in Moon Zappa's Valley Girl voice. There are three
short monologues:

I'm like green!
I'm like squat!
I'm like soul!
Repeat, like soul!
I'm like pull, push,
Okay, like slow, slow.

You're never too old
Like slow, like slow, like slow
Okay, I like it.


All right, faster, faster,
Go, do it, do it twice,
Yeah, that feels good,
I'm looking great,
Yeah, fer shure!
Like, no way!


""No Anchovies, Please""
J. Geils Band, LOVE STINKS

""No Anchovies, Please"" is a novelty song, really a narration with
sound effects, about a woman who is kidnapped after eating
anchovies. She is taken to a ""foreign-speaking"" country. The sound
effect of the foreign tongue seems reversed. When you do play it
in reverse, it becomes: ""It doesn't take a genius to know the
difference between chicken shit and chicken salad.""


""Darling Nikki""
Prince, PURPLE RAIN

""Darling Nikki,"" cited as porn rock before Congress, is about a
dominatrix in a hotel lobby masturbating with a magazine. In part,
the complaint was that the album cover (flowers, and Prince on a
motorcycle) wasn't explicit enough to warn kids of the suggestive
lyrics. Senator Paula Hawkins apparently was not aware of a
backward message hidden in ""Darling Nikki."" The last thirty-five
seconds of the song is gibberish. The music changes abruptly and
becomes a repeated glottal sound. Then a two-syllable sound is
repeated twice, something like ""heaven, heaven."" Unintelligible
speech follows. At the end is a sound reminiscent of rain or bacon
frying , and wind sounds.
     Played backward, the message becomes:

     Hello, how are you?
     I'm fine 'cause I know that the Lord is coming soon.
     Coming, coming soon.

     It is clearly Prince and the Revolution singing this. The
words are clear but the intonation is funny -- the linger on some
words. Perhaps this is to make the reversed message you hear
playing the record normally a little less conspicuous.
     This is a weird reversal of the supposed secret message
menace. Raunchy forward lyrics conceal a religious secret message.


""Judas Kiss""
Petra, MORE POWER TO YOU

Petra is an obscure group that sings religious songs to a rock
beat. As further proof that things have gone full circle, the
backward-masking controversy prompted Petra to include a wholesome
backward message on their MORE POWER TO YOU album. It is in the
transition between two songs, just before ""Judas Kiss."" Clearly
audible gibberish reverses to this (the husky voice a cross
between George Beverly Shea and Dee Snider): ""What are you looking
for the Devil for, when you ought to be looking for the Lord?""

AFL JoyceM Welcome to the Apple II Music & Sound chat - our discussion will
           be on NoiseTracker - the new FTA music program for the GS.  AFA
           Gene will be our host this evening...Gene, the floor is yours :)

AFA Gene   Hi all... well first I'd like to point out, if y'all aren't aware
           yet, that a spanking new version of NoiseTracker has recently
           been released (9 days ago) and is now available in our New Files
           library. It is version 0.5. I haven't played around with it much
           yet, but it's supposed to fix a lot of the little bugs in 0.3
           (the first version we had online).  NoiseTracker also includes
           the ability to directly import ""modules,"" a term used for a
           certain type of Amiga song file which has become popular among PC
           users using the SoundBlaster sound card.

           Now, via NT, these ""MOD"" files are accessible by the GS. We
           expect to see a lot of activity on this end as far as ports from
           the PC and Amiga go. Note that you should be able to go straight
           to the PC music forum and download any recently uploaded MOD
           songfiles (there was a bug in the first wide release of the PCAO
           software, however, so a bunch of files with dates between around
           March 1991 and September 1991 may not download properly. Note that
           to use these PC MOD files, you'll have to rename the downloaded
           file ""MOD.xxxxxx"" if you want it to show up automatically in NT's
           ""open"" dialog box. (On the PC, all MOD files are named
           ""xxxxxxxx.MOD"" instead.)   Also, if the files are packed with ZIP
           compression, you'll need a program from the Communications Forum
           called AGATE -- it's a terminal program that includes the ability
           to unpack ZIP files.

           Now, I guess the best thing to do would be to talk about our
           favorite songfiles... there have been a few complaints, in fact,
           that people were not being ""descriptive"" enough in their file
           descriptions for uploads in describing the songs.

AFC Eddie  ?

AFA Gene   GA ed

AFC Eddie  Once a MOD file is unpacked with Agate, is a file type change
           needed?

AFA Gene   Nope, since all that NT looks for is the ""MOD."" being the first
           four characters in the filename.

AFC Eddie  OK, Thanks!

Deanna7332 Question...

JonL7      Can you list some of the features of Noisetracker?

AFA Gene   (you don't even need that ""MOD."" if you want to type the name in
           directly.)

Deanna7332 Did any of these mod files have anything to do with FTA's ""Module
           A""

AFA Gene   Sure Jon, right after we answer Deanna's question. Deanna, you
           mean ""Modulae?""

Deanna7332 Yes, that's it.

AFA Gene   Modulae was a demo written by FTA last year. (i'll get to you in a
           sec Doors).  It used SoundSmith v0.95 for all it's music. There
           is no connection between MOD files and Modulae by FTA.

Deanna7332 Throughout the demo it said ""Loading modules""

AFA Gene   Those ""modules"" are not the same as Amiga soundfile ""modules"" --
           you see, what Modulae really was was a ""stringing together"" of a
           bunch of neat little tiny demos that FTA had written. So they
           called each little demo a ""module"" and thus the entire demo as a
           whole, ""Modulae"" (fancy plural of module?)

Deanna7332 Ok I understand.  Thank you. :)

AFL JoyceM Latin, Gene :)

AFA Gene   The term ""MODule"" from the Amiga comes from the idea that all the
           stuff needed to play the songfile (all the instruments + the
           sequence file) are included into one file, the ""module.""

TheDoors1  Gene, I have tried to d/l some recent uploaded MODs in the PC
           music area and still the problem exists.

AFA Gene   As I understand it, the problem was fixed VERY recently (correct
           me on this Joyce) and files uploaded as recently as early
           November still might not work depending on the version of the
           PCAO software that the uploader used.

AFL JoyceM Actually, Gene...I was under the impression that it had been, but
           if Doors is still having a problem, then it must not be fixed.

AFA Gene   What date was the file you tried to d/l, Door?

TheDoors1  umm 11/17, around there

AFA Gene   hmmm.... well i can tell you one thing... if it didn't work, don't
           waste your time again later... the problem is in the Apple
           software's method of d/lling files, and there are no plans to
           upgrade the Apple AO software.

AFL JoyceM I will endeavor to get an answer to that PC downloading
           problem/question :)

ThomasK63  i have a quick question... what can you use to unpack amiga mod
           files? On the PC side, that is.

TheDoors1  Agate Thomas

ELECTMUSIC Doors... what happens on after downloading..

Deanna7332 If it's LZHed you can't unless you have an IBM or
           PC/Transporter.

AFA Gene   If GS-ShrinkIt doesn't have that ability, i don't think there
           exists any such utility on the GS.

TheDoors1  What do you mean Elect?

ELECTMUSIC After you download the file... where do you encounter a problem?

TheDoors1  ok, you know when you download the file and at some point in the
           download the file starts to appear on your screen.  That's when I
           cancel it.

ThomasK63  I am sure soething good can be made w/out resorting to Amiga
           files

AFC Eddie  Yes, Doors, I believe the problem is with the PC software it was
           UL'd with.

TheDoors1  yeah Eddie.

GNO Tim    Amiga MOD files are typically compressed using LHarc.  I've
           uncompressed several on my Unix machine at school.

ThomasK63  good time for someone to make a lharc unpacker...

AFC DYAJim someone might be ;)

GNO Tim    Several people are already

AFC Eddie  Can't wait, Jim!

AFA Gene   Jon, did you have a question?

JonL7      The features of Noisetracker :)

AFA Gene   Oh yes... okay, here goes, in a nutshell, from most important to
           least:


AFA Gene   *  ability to import MOD files

           *  ability to import Soundsmith files

           *  ProDOS 8 based

           *  virtually no editing abilities (not a feature but important to
           know)

AFC DYAJim :)

AFA Gene   *  forgot: and the most important feature of all, the ability to
           hold instrument files in regular system RAM instead of DOC RAM,
           allowing for instruments far beyond the regular 64K limit found
           in ALL other GS music programs.

ThomasK63  I'll buy that!

TheDoors1  I have another question...when you're ready.

AFA Gene   GA Doors

TheDoors1  ok..is it true that NoiseTracker will take in soundsmith files and
           play them more clearly

AFA Gene   Well, as far as ""what you hear,"" yes there is a definite
           difference with some instruments. It does NOT play the sounds
           more ""clearly,"" but it just plays them in a different way. What
           many people seem to like about this ""different way"" is that
           sustained instruments (i.e. instruments designed to be played
           in a loop to simulate a long held note) seem to work better (or
           perhaps simply the way they were originally intended to work).

TheDoors1  I see

Deanna7332 Which takes up more space - MOD or NT  w/soundfile ?

AFA Gene   Deanna, it depends a few things, such as how big the sequence is,
           how many instruments you have, etc. Once you have a lot of
           assorted files, it'll probably average out to be about the same
           give or take a hundred blocks on your HD. So it basically depends
           on whether you prefer to have your instruments separate or not.

Deanna7332 Does playing quality differ with either one ?

AFA Gene   Nope. It's exactly the same either way. Loading time is the same
           too.

AFC Eddie  Can NT save songs as MOD files?

AFA Gene   Nope. It has options for Open and Close module, but these are
           still inactive.

AFA Gene   If there are no more questions, I'd like to talk about which NT
           files out there are the ""hottest,"" since this info could be
           useful to many users who are interested in downloading NT/MOD
           files.

           My personal favorite is ""Lambada,"" which is supplied by FTA with
           the program but is available separately on America
           Online.Everything about this file is really impressive except
           perhaps the sound quality of the horn-ish melody instrument.

           What about y'all, what are your favorite NT files?

AFL JoyceM Gene, there is a classical song for NT, but can't remember the
           name, but it is good.

AFC Eddie  I like Dragnet!

ELECTMUSIC So do I Ed

TheDoors1  I like Seven something

Deanna7332 My most favorite of all mod files is Pleasure Principle

AFC Eddie  <--appreciate's Greg's taste!

AFL JoyceM :)

AFA Gene   Deanna, i assume you got that from a local board?

Deanna7332 I got it from the PC forum here.

TheDoors1  I saw it there also

Deanna7332 I think under ""Pleasure""

AFA Gene   Would you be able to upload it here? If it's really that good, we
           ought to have it available directly in our oun NT lib here (BTW
           folks, we will be releasing a new NoiseTracker software library
           soon!)

AFC Eddie  What a Forum!!!

Deanna7332 That sounds great!

AFL JoyceM Gene, do you think it will be possible for synthLAB files to be
           converted to MOD files?

AFL JoyceM MOD files?

AFA Gene   I doubt it, Joyce. The formats are so diametrically opposed in
           their entire basis of their file formats that it wouldn't be
           worth the time for a programmer to develop such a convertor.

Deanna7332 Isn't it possible to move the mod file from the PC forum to our
           music library?

AFA Gene   But..... it might be worth the time for a MIDI File Format to MOD
           convertor, since these two formats are more widely accepted.

Nuzz       they have nothing better to do Gene

ELECTMUSIC Gene.. some interesting similarities with DTune and NTracker

AFA Gene   They lose the file, tho, Deanna. :)

AFL JoyceM In what way, Greg?

ELECTMUSIC Both Prodos 8

Deanna7332 Shhh they won't know a thing :)

ELECTMUSIC I also believe Bill uses a shuttling of sound data between Doc
           Ram and Ram.

AFC Eddie  Interesting, Greg.

ELECTMUSIC Thats how he gets some of the excellent instrument quality

AFC Eddie  But Diversitune has that one distinction:  MIDI input.

AFL JoyceM Deanna, we would greatly appreciate it if you would upload that
           'Pleasure' song to our library :)

ELECTMUSIC Agreed Ed.. one of the factors FTA doesn't like to incorporate
           into their programs.

Deanna7332 I'll u/l it tonight if possible.

AFL JoyceM Thanks :)

AFC Eddie  Thanks, Deanna!

AFL JoyceM I will send Bill B a copy of NoiseTracker + some MOD files...to
           see what comments we get from him (will send when I get back).

AFC DYAJim What ever happened to that diversitune upgrade that was talked
           about ?

ELECTMUSIC That would be interesting Joyce

AFC Eddie  Bill apparently still working on it, Jim.

ELECTMUSIC I am sure he would appreciate the Prodos 8

AFC DYAJim good..

AFL JoyceM Jim...RSN....he was hoping by Christmas (this year), but he is
           soooo busy with his job, who knows?

AFC DYAJim Oh yeah, I noticed the speed calcuation in NT .5 is inaccurate
           :)

AFC DYAJim I recall he has set a lot of Christmas projected dates :)

ELECTMUSIC He was one of the first ""Free Tools"" experts in breaking all the
           rules for economic sake.

AFC DYAJim like for the vaporware DT inst editor like 2 years ago.

Deanna7332 Are there any Christmas Mod or NT songs?

AFC Eddie  Oh yeah, Diversi-Editor!

AFL JoyceM I know, Jim - but that I know he has been working on.

AFC DYAJim he projected Christmas for it, and it never came :)

AFA Gene   Not yet in AMS, but hopefully the Holiday Contest will change all
           that. :)

AFC DYAJim I look foreward to any upgrades..

AFL JoyceM Not that I am aware of Deanna - you have some?  hint, hint

Deanna7332 Nope sorry.  I was hoping there were some that could be u/led
           here

AFC DYAJim I'll be breaking out the xmas tune book rsn.. I should be able to
           midi a few :) (which rules out nt)

AFL JoyceM Question...

AFC Eddie  It would be more appropriate to have a converter from Appleworks
           spreadsheet to MOD than from MIDI!

AFL JoyceM If I got ahold of an Amiga song (MOD) disk...how would I convert
           them for here?

AFA Gene   You mean an Amiga-formatted disk?

AFL JoyceM Yes

AFC DYAJim Ack.. methinks you need an amiga and a null modem cable or a
           modem.

AFA Gene   Methinks Jim is right

AFC DYAJim LOL!!  Design your music in the spreadsheet then import to NT :)
           IT might actually have better editing?!! :)

AFC Eddie  Right!

AFL JoyceM Me thinks he is right.  If I had them upload to me, would that
           work?

AFA Gene   Yep; should work like a charm.

AFC DYAJim Yah.. as long as they're coming from an amiga

AFL JoyceM Great....I will work on that when I get back  (making note now).

AFL JoyceM Gene, will you get some of those files (NT) sent to that area
           tonight?  If so, I will leave the needed message :)

AFA Gene   That's all I have planned for tonight's chat, Joyce. Yep, I'll
           move some files right now.

AFL JoyceM Thanks...

AFL JoyceM Then we should have our NoiseTracker Library by end of the week in
           AMS :)

ELECTMUSIC Gene... quick question:  Are you launching NTracker from a 3.5
           disk?

AFL JoyceM Okay, guys...I will see you all the week of December 11th (may the
           4th) as I am off on vacation.

AFA Gene   Yep greg

AFC JohnC  Where are you going?

ELECTMUSIC Do you encounter out of memory problems

AFL JoyceM Night all...and Gene, thanks for an excellent chat and great
           explanations of NoiseTracker.

Nuzz       Joyce, I have good news for FutureSound owners. SoundConvert will
           support it in the first release

AFC Eddie  Great, Mike!

AFA Gene   Greg, i always keep my RAMdisk at 0 when using noisetracker. Not
           only are

    John Michael Osbourne, (known as ""Ozzy"" to his fans), has in his long 
career as vocalist for Black Sabbath had his work with the group misconstrued 
as advocating Satanism.  In a 1983 radio special featuring Ozzy, the 
interviewer expressed precisely this point; ""...Ozzy has always been shrouded 
in the darkest of Satanic imagery.  Yet if you really listen to his music, 
you'll find that what he is saying differs greatly from his image....""(1)  Even 
the group's image has often been described as ""occult and diabolic"".(2)

    The important point to remember here is to differentiate between appearance 
and reality.  Although the name ""Black Sabbath"" conjures up images of witches 
and sorcerers paying homage to Satan for the powers bestowed upon them, this 
does not make it safe to assume that the group that went by this name 
necessarily drew the inspiration from the occult.(3)  The closest they ever 
came to it was a gothic horror film featuring Boris Karloff as narrator; they 
adopted their name directly from the name of this film.(4)  Black Sabbath was 
involved in the black arts as much as Karloff practiced casting spells off-
screen.  Tony Iommi, the group's guitarist, summed it up best when he described 
the group as having basically ""...the same appeal as a horror movie.  It's all 
an act.""(5)










    Just as their film counterpart did, Ozzy and Sabbath found the occult 
mythos to be an effective vehicle for powerful social commentary; particularly 
when put in the context of heavy-metal rock and roll.  Ozzy himself noted that 
there are ""...people who pick up my [album] cover[s] and go...'This guy's got 
to be singing about Devil, doom, death and destruction.'  Which is not the 
case....""(6)

    The late Lester Bangs likened the group to Bob Dylan and William Burroughs, 
describing them all as ""...moralists...trying to deal with a serious present 
situation in an honest way....""(7)  Ozzy and Black Sabbath merely bring to 
light the many evils of our world in their work, to try and make us realize 
that we are all victim to their influence.  They hope to make us recognize 
these evils so that we may take up arms against them; a point Ozzy emphatically 
stresses:  ""...one thing everybody has got to understand about Black Sabbath's 
lyrics.  They're not downer lyrics, they're just telling everybody where it's 
at...""(8)  He also cites the group's most controversial tune, ""Black Sabbath"", 
as a response to the ignorant hippie culture still force when the tune was 
written in 1970:  ""The hippies said: 'The world is beautiful man.' (sic)  You 
only had to look around you to see how crappy it was.  It was ridiculous 
listening to that stuff, let alone playing it, so we just wrote about the world 
the way it really was and how it affected us - and we felt better in ourselves 
because we were really being honest....""(9)

    I   1   HAVE YOU EVER THOUGH ABOUT YOUR SOUL-
        2   CAN IT BE SAVED?
        3   OR PERHAPS YOU THINK THAT WHEN YOU ARE DEAD
        4   YOU JUST STAY IN YOUR GRAVE.
        5   IS GOD JUST A THOUGHT WITHIN YOUR HEAD OR IS
        6   HE A PART OF YOU?
        7   IS CHRIST JUST A NAME THAT YOU READ IN A BOOK
        8   WHEN YOU WERE AT SCHOOL?

    II  9   WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT DEATH DO YOU LOSE
        10  YOUR BREATH OR DO YOU KEEP YOUR COOL?
        11  WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE THE POPE ON THE END
        12  OF A ROPE - DO YOU THINK HE'S A FOOL?
        13  WELL I'VE SEEN THE TRUTH - YES I'VE SEEN 
        14  THE LIGHT AND I'VE CHANGED MY WAYS.
        15  AND I'LL BE PREPARED WHEN YOU'RE LONELY 
        16  AND SCARED AT THE END OF OUR DAYS.

    III 17  COULD IT BE YOU'RE AFRAID OF WHAT YOU'R
        18  FRIENDS MIGHT SAY 
        19  IF THEY NEW YOU BELIEVED IN GOD ABOVE
        20  THEY SHOULD REALISE BEFORE THE CRITICISE
        21  THAT GOD IS THE ONLY WAY TO LOVE.

    IV  23  IS YOUR MIND SO SMALL THAT YOU HAVE TO FALL
        24 IN WITH THE PACK WHEREVER THEY RUN
        25  WILL YOU STILL SNEER WHEN DEATH IS NEAR
        26  AND SAY THEY MAY AS WELL WORSHIP THE SUN.

    V   27  I THINK IT WAS TRUE IT WAS PEOPLE LIKE YOU
        28  THAT CRUCIFIED CHRIST
        29  I THINK IT IS SAD THE OPINION YOU HADE WAS THE
        30  ONLY ONE VOICED.
        31  WILL YOU BE SO SURE WHEN YOUR DAY IS NEAR
        32  SAY YOU DON'T BELIEVE?
        33  YOU HAD THE CHANCE BUT YOU TURNED IT DOWN
        34  NOW YOU CAN'T RETRIEVE.










    VI  35  PERHAPS YOU'LL THINK BEFORE YOU SAY THAT
        36  GOD IS DEAD AND GONE
        37  OPEN YOUR EYES, JUST REALIZE THAT HE IS THE
        38  ONE.
        39  THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN SAVE YOU KNOW FROM
        40  ALL THIS SIN AND HATE.
        41  OR WILL YOU STILL JEER AT ALL YOU HEAR?
        42  YES!-I THINK IT'S TOO LATE.

    In this piece, the group asserts a belief in an afterlife and spiritual 
redemption.  As grisly as the image of a hanged pontiff is, its shock value is 
a necessary part of the message:  They reject religious dogma, stating that a 
belief in God, in one's own heart, is the only guiding light to help one inn 
his life (lines 11/12, 39/40).  Furthermore, the reject religious hypocrisy 
(lines 5/6, 7/8) and peer pressure (verses III, IV) as excuses for not 
accepting God.  To clarify further:  following the crowd does not justify 
shrugging responsibility for one's own actions.

    After re-reading, it becomes obvious that this song is an ascerbic critique 
of atheism; (line 35/36) I refer here again to verses three and four.  In these 
two verses, the picture painted in one of Godless conformity and how it's 
viewed as being as foolish as Paganism.  These lyrics set an example for the 
listener by relating personal experience (lines 13-16).  However, for those who 
cannot accept this the group has no recourse but to condemn them, although 
rather ironically; they hope that their rhetorical loss of faith in the 
listener will open his eyes (line 42).










                           B L A C K   S A B B A T H 



            WHAT IS THIS, THAT STANDS BEFORE ME?
            FIGURE IN BLACK, WHICH POINTS AT ME
            TURN ROUND QUICK AND START TO RUN
            FIND OUT I'M THE CHOSEN ONE.  OH, NO!
            
            BIG BLACK SHAPE WITH EYES OF FIRE
            TELLING PEOPLE THEIR DESIRE
            SATAN'S SITTING THERE, HE'S SMILING
            WATCHES THOSE FLAMES GET HIGHER AND HIGHER
            OH, NO, NO, -- PLEASE GOD HELP ME!
            
                IS THIS THE END MY FRIEND?
                SATAN'S COMING 'ROUND THE BEND
                PEOPLE RUNNING 'CAUSE THEY'RE SCARED
                THE PEOPLE BETTER GO AND BEWARE
                NO, NO!  PLEASE--NO!!
                
                
    The all time controversy winner!  Is this not irrefutably  THE song about 
Black Magic in rock?  It's all so obvious, suffuse with evil imagery; Satan, 
walls of flame, figure in black, and damnation at the end.  Yes, I see the 
images too; it definitely concerns Black Magic.  Then again, Shakespeare's 
Macbeth employed scenes of witches involved in conjurations; does that mean 
that Shakespeare was a warlock?  Poe used to write sardonic tragedies about 
twisted murderers and the bizarre nature of acts, did that make him an evil, 
leering, demented killer?  Did either of them advocated what they wrote about?  
One has to remember that writing about something is not necessarily the same as 
emulating it.  Tony Iommi spoke out quite strongly about this:  ""People are 
bringing us down saying that we are a Black Magic group.  I think they must be










getting mixed up with Black Widow.  We don't do any sacrifices on stage, and 
we're not on a black magic kick.  We wanted to do heavy numbers and the guitar 
riffs we worked out were more suited to evil things than love.  We play songs 
about black magic, but they are more likely to be against than for it.""(12)  

    By now, you're probably asking yourself who Black Widow is, right?  Then 
it's time for a little history:

        Sabbath, before they were known as Sabbath, had the same line-up but 
two earlier names.  The first one was Polka Tulk, which seemed sure to doom 
them to obscurity.(13)  The soon realized this and changed the group's name to 
Earth.  Now, Earth was a blues band at the end of the English blues boom.  As 
if that wasn't bad enough, they soon discovered that not only was there another 
group named Earth, but they had also released a single.  To avoid confusion, 
they changed their name again.(14)  But what made them decide on that name?  
Just ask Ozzy:  ""I just liked the name Black Sabbath because of the succession 
of vowel sounds.(15)  If that sounds ludicrous just consider this:  Sabbath was 
""...the first of the really committed, loud and heavy bands...""(16)  They 
needed a name to match the gut-wrenching power they were developing.  Tony knew 
that he wanted Sabbath to be noticed above all the rest of the British blues 
bands:  ""We wanted something of our own that we'd like and people would like.  
And we wanted something loud!""










    Tony didn't hate the blues.  He'd cut his teeth as a guitarist on the likes 
of The Shadows, Buddy Holly and Django Rheinhardt, developing his own style 
from there.  But he realized the group had no future in the blues:

        'We couldn't keep playing 12-bars forever.  We just got fed up with 
Earth music.  It was jazz, blues stuff.  It was good for practice but nothing 
else.'

    In the late 'Sixties, blues groups were a dime a dozen in Birmingham and 
interest was waning in the blues boom due to the glut of groups.  One man, by 
the name of Jim Simpson, had heard Earth around the Birmingham club circuit and 
understood what they were trying to do.  He decided to take them under his 
wing.  With the aid of his massive record collection, Jim expanded the group's 
horizons in the areas of jazz and blues.  He introduced them to artists like 
Wes Montgomery, Count Basie and Jimmy Rushing.  It was from Rushing in 
particular that they derived the repetitive riff style so readily noticeable in 
their later incarnation as Black Sabbath.

    The Count Basie influence is evidenced in the song ""Wicked World"" from the 
first album; Sabbath drummer Bill Ward uses a ""'sighing hi-hat'...in the manner 
of Basie's drummer Jo Jones.""










    The influence is subtle, almost subliminal.  Yet it is one which was not 
thought capable of hard, 'heavy' rock bands in the late 'Sixties.  Although Led 
Zeppelin and Jimi Hendrix also had their work steeped in blues and jazz 
derivations (Hendrix' ""Third Stone From the Sun"" and Zeppelin's version of 
Willie Dixon's ""I Can't Quit You Baby"" from their first album), neither was 
able to match the intense energy of Black Sabbath.  Iommi has always had a 
preference for music with an original, distinct style of its' own; as an 
example, he mentions guitarists Joe Pass and Alvin Lee as two of his strongest 
songwriting influences.

    It would also be necessary that Sabbath develop a unique, distinctive style 
and image of their own.  Though they had changed their name from Earth to Black 
Sabbath to avoid confusion with the other Earth; at the same time another group 
emerged by the name of Black Widow ""...who WERE profoundly influenced by the 
occult, had a male witch as a patron, and wrote pieces like ""Come to The 
Sabbat.""  Unfortunately, Sabbath was constantly reaping the benefits of Widow's 
publicity.

    Sabbath was a group that never minced words.  If they saw something as 
destructive, they would be sure to rub the listener's face it it.  They did not 
want their point to be missed.

    With their straightforward, sometimes brutal way of looking at things, they 
try to shock the listener's conscience back into awareness.  The imagery of 
""Hand of Doom"", from the Paranoid album, is candid and condemning; it is a 
strong statement against drug addiction and rightly so...

            IT'S TO LATE TOO TURN
            YOU DON'T WANNA LEARN
            PRICE OF LIFE YOU CRY
            NOW YOU'RE GONNA DIE
            
            
    Many people felt the group's overall direction was pessimistic and had a 
negative effect on its listener's due to that.  ""Ozzy insisted that if people 
thought he was having a bad effect on the minds of young kids, they should go 
and watch the TV news where real murder and mayhem were a way of life, and 
shown night after night."" (18)

    Sabbath was never negative in their message; they were simply truthful 
about waht they saw as wrong in the world.  If you ""Strip away the horror 
stories, the imagery and the hysteria, (and) turn down the amps a notch...you 
have a well-rehearsed, solid blues and rock band, powered by a dedication to 
well defined objectives.""  On the top of the list of those objectives was 
truth; Sabbath never feared facing that truth squarely, regardless of what many 
people thought of them.

Long, long, time ago,
I can still remember,
When the local calls were ""free"".
And I knew if I paid my bill,
And never wished them any ill,
That the phone company would let me be...

But Uncle Sam said he knew better,
Split 'em up, for all and ever!
We'll foster competition:
It's good capital-ism!

I can't remember if I cried,
When my phone bill first tripled in size.
But something touched me deep inside,
The day... Bell System... died.

And we were singing...

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

Is your office Step by Step,
Or have you gotten some Crossbar yet?
Everybody used to ask...
Oh, is TSPS coming soon?
IDDD will be a boon!
And, I hope to get a Touch-Tone phone, real soon...

The color phones are really neat,
And direct dialing can't be beat!
My area code is ""low"":
The prestige way to go!

Oh, they just raised phone booths to a dime!
Well, I suppose it's about time.
I remember how the payphones chimed,
The day... Bell System... died.

And we were singing...

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

Back then we were all at one rate,
Phone installs didn't cause debate,
About who'd put which wire where...
Installers came right out to you,
No ""phone stores"" with their ballyhoo,
And 411 was free, seemed very fair!

But FCC wanted it seems,
To let others skim long-distance creams,
No matter 'bout the locals,
They're mostly all just yokels!

And so one day it came to pass,
That the great Bell System did collapse,
In rubble now, we all do mass,
The day... Bell System... died.

So bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

I drove on out to Murray Hill,
To see Bell Labs, some time to kill,
But the sign there said the Labs were gone.
I went back to my old CO,
Where I'd had my phone lines, years ago,
But it was empty, dark, and ever so forlorn...

No relays pulsed,
No data crooned,
No MF tones did play their tunes,
There wasn't a word spoken,
All carrier paths were broken...

And so that's how it all occurred,
Microwave horns just nests for birds,
Everything became so absurd,
The day... Bell System... died.

So bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

We were singing:

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?

We will have a mighty Party           It was good enough for Sappho
In the honor of Astarte               With her lady on her lap-o

'Cause she's good enough for me!      With her pagan poetry!

Shall we sing a verse for Venus,    Well the Christians all are humming
Of the Gods she is the meanest,     Cause they say their God is coming,
Cause she bit me on my...elbow      Our God came three times this evening
And it's good enough for me.        And that's good enough for me.

                                             IMPERIUM COMPOUND    
                                             (Atenveldt Verses)

   Now here's a story, a little bit gory,
   A little bit happy, a little bit sad.
   About a drink called Imperium Compound
   And how the SCA's been had!                       

   Chorus: Oh we think, we think, we think,
           The King is a fink, a fink, a fink,
           A figure of respectability
           Rules the Kingdom thru Imperium Compound
           The results are plain to see!

   Mongol Hordemen, those free-living swordsmen
   Subverting the Kingdoms from underneath!
   Have no use for Imperium Compound
   Except perhaps to brush their teeth!

   AltChorus: Oh we fink, we fink, we fink,
              The Khan and the Kink, the Kink, the Kink,
              And the Board, their Great Senilities!
              The Western Irgun, drinks Imperium Compound
              And we're BACK, with results you'll see!    

   Lady Laurel, with Authority Royal,
   Passes and rejects our heraldry
   She needs a swig of Imperium Compound
   Then perhaps she'd deign to talk to me!            

   Lady Trude thought it her duty
   To turn a social wrong into a Right
   Proved her point with Imperium Compound
   And showed that Cheshire Cats can fight!  //and scratch//

   The Board of Directors styled themselves The Electors
   And another con they tried to swing
   Now the BoD drinks Imperium Compound
   So we no longer need a King!                        

   AltChorus: Oh the Bod, the BoD, the BoD,
              It thinks it is God, is God, is God,
              The figure of Supreme Authority!
              And if we O.D.'d on Imperium Compund
              there'd be no need for Royalty!          

   Oh, MEDIEVAL Net, we thought it was all wet
   With witty remarks, and other kinds of sass
   We'll feed our computers on Imperium Compound
   And BYTE the BoD right on its' righteous ass!         

   Good old Duncan was often drunken
   Chasing all the ladies fair
   He bathed himself in Imperium Compound
   Now he has a little savoir faire!                     

                    (more)


  ATEN IMPERIUM (cont.)

   Ioseph of Locksley, never changes his socks, he
   Runs around looking like a Cavalier,
   He stocked up on Imperium Compound
   And he has enough to last for years and years!        

   AltChorus: Oh they forgot, forgot, forgot
              The Locks-e-ly Plot, the Plot, the Plot!
              And it works the best when it is underground!
              It isn't a hassle for a green-and-white tassle
              They're the ones that BREW Imperium Compound!  

   Trelon of the Wood, he was very good, he
   Was a leader that had never been beat before;
   But Caid had Imperium Compound,
   And Imperial Roman Caid won the War!  //with help!//   

   In Tyr Ysgithr, it's regularly whispered there
   That the Kingdom is ruled over by a King    // What's THAT? //
   They're ""democratic"" and quite erratic....
   They've forgot the purpose of the whole damn thing!     

   King Sir Mark von, with his pretty white suit on,
   Rules the Kingdom both with Grace and Purity!
   He never touches Imperium Compound
   At least not where anyone else can see!               

   Duke Sir Deaton, was never beaten
   On the field, or in the drinking hall;
   At the Catbox War with Caid,
   Left thirty bodies piled against the wall!             

   Denis O'Titans was good at smitin'
   A Locksley Monster in every single way!
   Drank a little Imperium Compound
   And ATE Deaton's sword that day  // No! REALLY! //

                          WTP-0002C

        Last night I had the strangest dream in this bleak century
        I dreamed that people the world around believed in Chivalry

        I dreamed I saw a Kingly Crown enshrined in laurel leaves
        with Grace and Joy and Purity attendant at his feet

        I dreamed I saw the perfect Knight receive his accolade
        and minstrels sang and children laughed in some soft forest glade

        I dreamed I saw the finest thing that ever man could make
        grow great and strong and undefiled: Pray God I never wake!

        Last night I had the strangest dream in this bleak century
        I dreamed that people the world around believed in Chivalry

                strike the helm and bash the shield
                make their eyeteeth rattle
                Bodies on the ground will lie
                bones will burst in sunder

            There is a man who we know well that does the best he can
            but he's displayed in armour made of reticulated garbage cans!

            He looks so fine and fair and strong, oh how he plays the man
            and how it's prized, those galvanized, reticulated garbage cans

            The noblest Roman of them all, a good Praetorian
            a combatant who wears no pants, judst reticulated garbage cans!

            Like old Horatius at the Bridge, like the Legions of Valerian
            (O dearie me: those LOVELY knees!)
            and those reticulated garbage cans!

         (sung to the tune (obviously) of the 12 Days of Christmas)


1.           The first time I sent my device, The Heralds said to me

            ""It violates the Rule of Three""

2.           The next time I tried it, the Heralds said to me

            ""We changed the forms, and it violates the Rule of
             Three"".

3.           The third time I tried, and the Heralds said to me, 

            ""We upped the fees, we changed the forms, and it
             violates the Rule of Three"".

4.           Another time I tried and the Heralds said to me,
 
            ""We haven't got it, we upped the fees, we changed the 
             forms, and it violates the Rule of Three"".

5.           The fifth time I tried it, the Heralds said to me,  

            ""In a decision rendered by the College of Arms on
             August 1st, A.S. V it was decided that this style of
             heraldic design was not appropriate to the aims and 
             intentions of the Corporate Body. Holy! Holy! Holy! ""

 note: verse 5 is delivered in an extremely fast, mono-
       tone, similiar to a Gregorian Chant.

           "" ....we haven't got it, we upped the fees, we changed the forms,
             and it violates the Rule of Three.""

6.           I tried it a sixth time, and the Heralds said to me,

            ""We changed the rules, &c""

7.           A seventh time I tried and, the Heralds said to me,

            ""It's against the Rule of Tincture, we changed the
             rules, &c""

8.           I tried it once again and the heralds said to me,

            ""It's not a Period design, It's against the Rule of Tincture, We
             changed the rules, &c""

                                * more *



    Heralds Said To Me (cont.)

9.           I sent it in once more, and the Heralds said to me,

            ""We changed the rules again, It's not a Period design,
             it's against the Rule of Tincture, we changed the
             rules, &c""

10. (sung in cold anger)
             The LAST time I sent my device, the Heralds said to me

    (sung in a state of SMUG)
             ""Someone else has got it, &c""




              (nb: every single one of these reasons has been used by the
              CoA, at one point or another, to reject perfectly good
              heraldry, along with some even MORE stupid.  If the shoe 
              fits....................!!!!!!!!)

   or: There may be Lice on all you Knice, but there ain't no Lice on me

           Once there was a Barony howling in the wilderness
           nestled in the Valley where the River doesn't flow
           and the folks were driven buggy by the insects in the Revel Hall
           Authenticity is wonderful, but this doesn't go!

                   Bugs on the Baroness, bugs on the Baroness!
                   That was the cry that you heard all the day
                   and the scratching can be heard from Ysgithr to Ered Sul
                   why did we come here? Let's go away!

           See them all a scratching, nestled in their armour tight
           the fleas have a melee team that's challenging the field!
           call Truly Nolen! Someone's gotta help us out!
           the crabs are nesting in our helms but we'll never yield!

                   (chorus)

           Dawn comes a-breaking, the bugs have won the Coronet...
           flea-infested Conan-clones in piles upon the lawn
           where is the Barony? The bugs have eaten everyone...
           termites got the stick-jocks, and all their sticks are gone!

      What the use of wearing panties
      whalebone corsets of your Auntie's
      boxer shorts and other scanties
      best of all is nude
      there's such fun in going bra-less
      now that it's no longer lawless
      'specially if your figure's flawless
      best of all is nude
      nude is what you're born in
      shirts are never torn in
      underwear and lacy flimsies, garter belts and other whimsies
      yards of itchy cloth to put your form in
      ducks all do it, maidens rue it
      even ancient Picts in Britain blue it
      going naked's how to do it
      best of all is nude!

      If your garters aren't elastic
      tie them up in knots fantastic
      (panty hose is something drastic!)
      best of all is nude!
      If you're tired of wearing clotheses
      shed your garment 'mongst the roses
      never mind the old bluenoses
      best of all is nude!
      Nude is best for ducking!
      Worst for horses bucking!
      Moonlit nights will see such sights
          that are very best for fooling round
                              .....and elbows!
      Nudity is grand to see
       a well-known antidote to virginity
      take your clothes off and you'll see:
      best of all is nude!

                   spun three times and said with a sigh
                   hadn't been for the Runes had his other eye!

                   prettiest thing I've ever seen
                   she went down underneath the hill
                   and came back out of her own free will

                   Brian Boru, on Irish ground
                   walked three times the Island round
                   Norsemen came lookin for a fight

                   got six feet of English ground

                   the Legion with it's Eagles bright
                   marched into the Pictish night
                   met them there upon the sand
                   gave em up to the Wicker Man!

                   eight-legged steed and hound of Hel

                   the Circle goes where no man knows

                   Present is Past and Past is Me!

                   Rhiannon's Birds are still in flight

                    WEAPONS AT THE DOOR

 Being a Polemic concerning the alleged Custom of the West Kingdom concerning 
 checking your Weapons at the Door of the Revel Hall. As the Satire is the 
 Weapon of the Bard, this said Polemic is to be checked at the Door, along with 
 swords, knives, redheaded Ladies and other such Deadly Things.....

         As I roved out to Western Lands to take the Western Air
         I went into a Revel Hall and I saw a Twelfth Night there
         but I was halted at the gate by a Privy Consellor
                 (that's the man who tells the King of the West how to go to
                  the bath room!)
         who told me I would have to check my Weapons at the door

         As I, in my astonishment, stood hung on tenter-pegs
         a Knight came in whose Prouess hung down between his legs
         the Doorman grabbed a greatsword and he struck the Knight full sore
         and gave him a reciept; he left his weapon at the door!

         a Bard was next whose goodly Voice has entertained us all
         but he, too, was prevented from entering the Hall
         and told he could not carry deadly weapons on the floor
         he left his Voice and Harp among the weapons at the door

         a Master entered graciously, a man we all know well
         who holds a 3rd Dan Black Belt, tho this he'd never tell
         the Master struggled valiantly, the Master cursed and swore
         but he left his hands, and feet, as weapons at the door

         the company was jovial, altho a bit dismayed
         for lack of proper cutlery, down to the smallest blade
         for even teeth and fingernails, each can be used in War
         were cut, and pulled, and left behind, as weapons at the door!

         And has their King not loyal Knights that He must be afraid
         of brawling in his Hall and of Assassin's bloody blade?
         the Rights of Men to carry Arms at least WE'VE not foreswore
         and a POX on them that made the Rule of Weapons at the Door!

               I spied a young Mongol all dressed in white linen
               all dressed in white linen and cold as the clay

               I then spied another, done in on the sidewalk
               along with just about six dozen more
               their wounds were all gaping, from mace and from braoadsword
               from claymore and cannon, all dripping with gore

               what caused this grave carnage, I cried to the Monglos
               oh pray what's the reason for this awful sight
               my answer came slowly from under the corpse-pile
               ""It seems that our bark is much worse than our bite.....""

               the answer continued from pale lips a-shaking
               we sang all our songs and believed them as true
               the Dark Horde could never be beaten in battle
               we thought this was what all good Mongols could do...

               we went down to Atenveldt all for to plunder
               ""too large to defend"" was our song every night
               but Atenveldt's different from East, West or Middle
               there, even the bushes have learned how to bite!

               the Clann stole our ponies, the Scraelings our foodstuffs
               we ran into axes in AtenViking hands
               our maidens ran off with one Richard of Arkham
               and we're all that's left to return to our lands

               MacChluarains and Monsters, Lockehaven and Foxmoor
               that Kingdom is BIG and its' fighters are MEAN!
               we fought and we lost, and fled back to Ann Arbor
               we all came back home with results that you've seen

               keep away from that Land with its' cactus and marshes
               it's no place for Mongols who are bent on War
               they count their blows well, but they strick them yet better
               he crawled into his Yurt, and fell, dead, on the floor.....

                       SONG OF THE THREE
             copyright 1981 W. J. Bethancourt III
                            C. A. Bethancourt III
       tune: the song of the Cowardly Lion, Tin Woodsman and Scarecrow
             in the movie version of the Wizard of Oz

        (Enter the Scarecrow, who singeth:)

        My wife is always nagging; my Prowess it is lagging
        I can't do anything
        she has got a reason, but revenge is out of season
        Oh I wish I could be King!

        If I just had the Crown on, I'd always have a frown on
        and the Barons on a string
        Heads they would be rolling, the Board would be cajoling
        Oh if only I was King!

        I am very fed up with the way this group is set up
        Oh I'd change everything!
        they are so high and mighty with the way that they do fight-ey
        Oh, someday I'll be King!

        Tho my wife is melancholic, and very...vitriolic
        she's a wasp without a sting!
        I'd have to supervise her with a pack of tranquilizers
        If I only was a King......

        (the Tin Woodsman joineth him, and singeth:)

        I grew up kind of cocky, and rather big, and stocky
        and straight as any rod
        on the field I'm a battallion, with the Ladies I'm a stallion
        ...Oh they'd better make me God!

        The other boys are jealous they say I'm over-zealous
        they'd do better to applaud
        the things that I am giving to this Dream that we are living
        oh I wish they'd make me God!

        They say that I'm conceited, but I'm just badly treated
        by people and by BoD
        just think of what they're missing by My Majesty dismissing
        Oh they'd better make me God!

        (the Cowardly Lion creepeth forth, and singeth:)

        Oh I could be a fighter, a great and mighty smiter
        and be the perfect knight
        it's a great and nasty shame, and everyone's to blame
        oh I wish that I could fight!

        Song of the Three (cont.)

        I could be a Cavalier drinking wine and ale and beer
        and be a gorgeous sight
        but it would cost me too much money so it isn't very funny
        oh I wish that I could fight!                               

        Let me at 'em on the field, I would surely make them yield
        to my Power and my Might
        with rattan, shinai and rapier they would nevermore escape here
        If they'd only let me fight

        (all doeth the Softe Shoe off, stage left)

                She was afraid to come out to the Tourney
                She was worried that ""something might show..""
                She was afraid to come out to the Tourney
                And the poor thing did NOT want to go...

                  (2 - 3 - 4, tell the people what she wore!)

                  It was an itsy bitsy teeny weenie little rabbit fur bikini

                  And in her apartment she wanted to stay!

                One day in the Kingdom of the Middle
                It happened at a Tourney one day:
                The Mongols invaded the Middle
                But the Middle did not want to play...

                  (eins - zwei - drei, but the Dark Horde wouldn't die!)

                  It was an itsy bitsy tiny teenie Nauseating Mongol weenie

          Some folks call me many names, others call me crazy
          Tom O'Bedlam's son am I, for my mind is hazy!
          I'd rather sing a song than work (if it's not too phrasey!)
          Lengthy rhymes don't bother me....truth to tell: I'm lazy!

          Yang, your yurt is very nice, and your Horde is smelly,
          And I'm sure that yak-meat will nicely fill one's belly!
          But remember this one line, or you're not worth jelly:
          FIRST you plunder, THEN you burn! That's how to be rakehelly!

          My Lady Lorelei your eyes do drive me to distraction
          And the lovely Care-Cheri causes....petrifaction!
          But I, and they, quite taken are, so I can't take action...
          Therefore, Ladies, fill my cup; I'll drink to stupefaction!

          Now Atenveldt your fighters, all, are most good and gentle
          And the Ladies, bless 'em all, are most ornamental!
          But that little Nikki-Toad....has me sentimental
          Though with boffer in her hand she is argumental!

          This stupid little song, m'lords, is mostly sung in Latin
          By the Goliards, of course, from vespers clear to matins!
          But I prefer a coarser cloth over silk or satins
          English is more understood, mine enemies to flatten!

          Good People all, I've made my Song, its' music's well-recited
          But my voice could use some work; the flowers it has blighted!
          It's rude and rusty, grim and bad, and squeaky like a door-hinge,
          But I'm a better Bard than you: I found a rhyme for ""orange!""

                      by William Poundstone
                              1983

     Two mentalities are at work here: 1960s rock fans and 1980s
fundamentalist Christians. The idea of phonographically concealed
messages dates from the Paul McCartney death scare of 1969. For
hard-core types, the secret-message rumors never really died. Avid
rock fans have auditioned ever album release since the late 1960s
for hidden nuances. Backward messages, barely audible messages,
and messages on one stereo track only have been alleged. At the
other end of the sociosensual spectrum, fundamentalist Christians
have gotten into the act. TV programs such as PRAISE THE LORD and
THE 700 CLUB have propagated rumors of a satanic plot in the
recording industry, no less, in which various albums conceal
""backward-masked"" demonic murmurings. If THAT sounds too spacey to
be taken seriously, consider that it was the fundamentalist groups
who were behind House Resolution 6363, a bill introduced in the
U.S. House of Representatives by Robert K. Dornan (R., Calif.) in
1982 to label all suspect records: ""WARNING: THIS RECORD CONTAINS
BACKWARD MASKING THAT MAKES A VERBAL STATEMENT WHICH IS AUDIBLE
WHEN THIS RECORD IS PLAYED BACKWARD AND WHICH MAY BE PERCEPTIBLE
AT A SUBLIMINAL LEVEL WHEN THIS RECORD IS PLAYED FORWARD."" In
February 1983, the Arkansas State Senate passed a similar record-
labeling bill by a vote of 86 to 0.
     Contributing to the quasi-occult status of these rumors is
the difficulty of checking them out on home audio equipment. You
pretty much have to take someone else's word for it, or dismiss
the rumors out of hand.
     From a technical standpoint, there are four simple ways to
conceal a verbal message on a recording. The most obvious is to
record the message at a very low volume. The message may then be
recovered by turning the volume up while playing the record or
tape. If the message is faint enough, though, noise levels of home
equipment may garble it. If the accompanying music or lyrics are
loud enough, or if the message itself is indistinct or
electronically modified, it may be hard to hear on any equipment.
     A second gimmick is to record a message on one stereo track
only. Records and tapes have two independent recordings, of
course, normally played simultaneously for stereo effect. On a
record, each stereo track occupies on one side of the V-shaped
groove for the needle. On a tape, the tracks are recorded in
parallel lanes of the magnetic material. The two tracks are called
""right"" and ""left"" after the stereo speakers they will play on.
Otherwise, the tracks are interchangeable -- the sound mixer can
put anything he or she wants on each track. A message on one track
can be masked by simultaneous loud music or lyrics on the opposite
track. With normal stereo balance (or mono equipment) the loud
track drowns out the message track. At home, single-track messages
can be recovered by adjusting the stereo balance so that only the
desired track plays. Sometimes this trick also makes indistinct
words clearer. Even if the words are not exclusively on one track,
they may happen to be more audible on one track.
     A message could be recorded at a speed different from the
rest of the record. Then the record would have to be played faster
or slower than usual to recover the message. Unless the message
was at one of the standard speeds (say, 45 rpm on a 33 1/3 rpm
record), it could not be played normally on home equipment.
     The fourth and most commonly alleged trick is to record a
verbal message backward. Reversed speech has several unexpected
features. One is that syllables are not a constant in the reversal
process. A one-syllable word can have two or three syllables when
played backward. Thus ""number nine"" in the Beatles' REVOLUTION 9
reverses to ""Turn me on, dead man"" (or something like it), a jump
from three to five syllables.
     There is no simple way to predict what a word or phrase will
sound like reversed. Obviously, you can't just reverse the
letters.
     Reversed messages are difficult to recover at home. Record
turntables are not built to go backwards. Some have a neutral
setting, in which the pickup and amplifier remain active and you
can turn the record backward by hand. But hardly anyone has a
stead enough hand to produce satisfactory results.
     With patience, it is possible to reverse a cassette
recording. Transfer the music from the original record or tape
onto a blank tape cassette. Place the cassette flat on a table.
Draw our the part of the tape with the suspected message and snip
it off at both ends. Hold the tape segment horizontally. Rotate it
180 degrees, keep it horizontal at all times. This turns the tape
end for end. Splice the reversed tape segment back onto the two
loose ends of the cassette with strong adhesive tape. Reel the
tape back inside the cassette. The sliced segment will play
backward on an ordinary cassette player.
     I rented a recording studio to test the secret-message
rumors. New copiies of the records in question were transcribed on
a quarter-inch master tape. Where rumor alleged that a single
stereo track contained a message, right and left stereo tracks
were transcribed separately. Records with alleged inaudible
messages were treated similarly. To test claims of reversed
messages, recordings on the master tape were edited out and
spliced in backward. Twenty cuts or portions of cuts from sixteen
albums were tested.


""Another One Bites the Dust""
Queen, THE GAME

Rumor: When played backward, the lyrics say, ""It's fun to smoke
marijuana.""
Findings: There is something that sounds like ""It's fun to smoke
marijuana"" in the reversed music. It is repeated over and over. It
might be rendered no less faithfully, however, as ""sfun to scout
mare wanna."" This ""message"" is the reversal of the song title,
which is repeated as a line in the song.
     Let's make a distinction between engineered and phonetic
reversals. When an artist records a verbal statement, reverses it
by turning the tape end for end, mixes the reversed statement onto
a master tape, and has records and tapes produced from the master,
that is an engineered reversal. When the phonetic properties of
song lyrics are such that they can be reversed to sound like
something else, that is a phonetic reversal.
     ""It's fun to smoke marijuna"" is clearly a phonetic reversal.
The lyrics are perfectly plain played forward (""Another one bites
the dust""), no so plain played backward (""sfun to scout mare
wanna""). With an engineered reversal, the opposite should hold
true: gibberish forward, clear as a bell backward. Some are
prepared to believe that phonetic reversals are just as
intentional as engineered reversals -- that the songwriter
painstakinginly planned the phonetic double-entendre. In the
absence of confirming evidence, that just doesn't wash. It's too
easy to find coincidences. If, for example, the letters of the
alphabet are recited in conventional fashion (Ay, Bee, Cee, etc.)
and reversed, at least five sound like English language words. D
reverses to ""eden,"" F becomes ""pray,"" S becomes ""say,"" V becomes
""even,"" and Z becomes ""easy."" ""It's fun to smoke marijuana"" is
likewise a coincidence.


""A Child is Coming""
Jefferson Starship, BLOWS AGAINST THE EMPIRE

Rumor: When played backward, ""son of Satan.""
Findings: Another phonetic coincidence. The repeated ""It's getting
better"" reverses to an iffy ""son of Satan,"" the ""of"" drawn out and
the ""Satan"" strongly accented on the first syllable.


""Eldorado""
Electric Light Orchestra, ELDORADO

Rumor: When played backward, ""He is the nasty one/ Christ, you're
infernal/ It is said we're dead men/ Everyone who has the mark
will live.""
Findings: Coincidence. The supposed message lurks around the line
""On a voyage of no return to see."" Reversed, this passage becomes
the expected syllable salad -- no one hearing it would describe it
as anything but reversed music. Only if you listen while reading
along with what you're supposed to hear will you get anything. The
rumored version of the message is somewhat fudged. The passage
sounds more like ""He's to nasty one/ Christ you are, Christ,
you're fernal/ There wiss uh, we're dead men..."" There is no ""in""
in what is taken to be ""infernal."" The line that is supposed to be
""Everyone who has the mark will live"" isn't even close, though the
syllable count is right.


""Shoo Be Doo""
The Cars, CANDY-O

Rumor: When played backward, the word ""Satan"" repeated
approximately eleven times.
Findings: Coincidence. The rumor refers to the reversal of the ""Shoo
be doo, shoo be doo, shoo be doo..."" near the end of the song. Given
the mysterious logic of reversed phonemes, these three-syllable units
can be hard as a repeated two-syllable word. The word sounds a little
like ""Satan.""


""Snowblind""
Styx, PARADISE THEATER

Rumor: According to a mimeographed list of suspect records distributed
by Congressman Dornan, the words ""Satan move through our voices"" when
played backwards.
Findings: Negative. Despite repeated listenings, it was not even
possible to identify the part of the reversed track that Dornan et al.
are talking about.


""Stairway to Heaven""
Led Zeppelin, untitled, a.k.a. STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN

Rumor: In reverse, ""I live for Satan... The Lord turns me off...
There's no escaping it... Here's to my sweet Satan... There's power in
Satan... He will give you 666.""
Findings: Coincidence. If you listen very carefully to the ""And it
makes me wonder"" lines in reverse, you'll hear something approaching
""There's no escaping it."" A better description is ""There's no escape
do."" Knock of the last syllable, and you have ""There's no escape,"" a
complete, intelligible sentence in reverse. It's there, all right, but
it's not an unlikely enough coincidence to -- well, make you wonder.
      The ""Satan"" in ""I live for Satan"" is good and clear. The ""I live
for"" part isn't. The other alleged lines are unremarkable. All are
phonetic reversals of the entirely lucid forward lyrics and obviously
just accidents.


""When Electricity Came to Arkansas""
Black Oak Arkansas, BLACK OAK ARKANSAS and RONCH AND ROLL

Rumor: In reverse, ""Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan. He is God. He
is God.""
Findings: The BLACK OAK ARKANSAS cut was reversed. Again, pairs of
reversed syllables are being freely interpreted as ""Satan."" ""He is
God"" was not identifiable.


""Rain""
The Beatles, HEY JUDE

Rumor: Unintelligible lyrics at the end are reversed.
Findings: A true engineered reversal and not really a secret. ""Rain""
seems to have been the first popular recording to incorporate an
obviously reversed lyric. The story is that John Lennon accidentally
spliced the last part of the song in backward and liked the effect.
When reversed, the strange-sounding vocals at the end become
intelligible as a reprise starting with the drawn-out word
""sunshine.""
      The reversal is less apparent to the casual listener than it
might be because the accompanying music is not reversed. The ending
fits in smoothly with the rest of the song, the vocals suggesting a
foreign language.


""Fire on High""
Electric Light Orchestra, FACE THE MUSIC

Rumor: When played backward, ""The music is reversible, but time --
turn back!""
Findings: ""Fire on High"" is instrumental. About twenty-six seconds
into the music, scrambled speech is heard. It is mostly louder than
the accompanying music and begins with a two-syllable unit repeated
several times. The seeming speech lasts for about fourteen seconds.
      Reversing the music confirms that there is a true, engineered
message. In reverse, a voice (Jeff Lynne's?) says, ""The music is
reversible, but time -- turn back! Turn back! Turn back! Turn back!""
All the words are clear and unambiguous. Anyone comparing this to the
alleged reversal on ELO's ""Eldorado"" will have no trouble telling
which is genuine.


""Goodbye Blue Sky""
Pink Floyd, THE WALL

Rumor: In reverse, ""You have discovered the secret message.""
Findings: The ""secret message"" is at the very end of the instrumental
passage following the ""Goodbye Blue Sky"" vocals. It comes just before
the words ""What shall we do"" at the start of the song that is
identified as ""Empty Spaces"" on the record label and as ""What shall we
do now?"" on the record sleeve. Played forward, the message is less
apparent than the FACE THE MUSIC reversal: A reasonably attentive
listener might play THE WALL through and not catch it. It suggests
speech not quite close enough to be overheard. In context this is not
unusual because the ""Goodbye Blue Sky"" instrumental passage includes
""airport noises"" and other sound effects. A loud climax in the music
further masks the unintelligible voice.
      When played backward, the voice (Roger Waters?) plainly intones,
""Congratulations, you have just discovered the secret message. Please
send your answer to old Pink, care of the funny farm..."" As the voice
fades out, there may be another word -- perhaps ""Chalfonte or
""Chelsea"" -- after ""funny farm.""


""Heavy Metal Poisoning""
Styx, KILROY WAS HERE

Rumor: A red sticker on the KILROY WAS HERE cover warns, ""By order of
the Majority for Musical Morality, this album contains secret backward
messages...""
Findings: This is a case of second-generation backward-masking. Styx'
PARADISE THEATER did not contain a backward message, though a lot of
people said it did. So Styx has included a sure enough backward
message on KILROY WAS HERE. It is at the very beginning of ""Heavy
Metal Poisoning."" The reversed speech last about three seconds. There
is no musical background. The words reverse to ""Annuit coeptis. Novus
ordo seclorum."" This is the Latin motto encircling the pyramid on the
back of a dollar bill. The usual translation: ""God has favored our
undertakings. A new order of the ages.""
      The cover sticker's ""Majority for Musical Morality"" is a
fictitious Falwellesque group in the KILROY WAS HERE video. Although
the sticker suggests a plurality of ""messages,"" only one was found.


Space between ""I'm So Tired"" and ""Blackbird""
The Beatles, untitled, a.k.a. THE WHITE ALBUM

Rumor: A reversed message. At the time of the Paul-is-dead stories,
the segue from ""I'm So Tired"" to ""Blackbird"" was offered as evidence.
It was held to contain John Lennon's voice, reveresed, saying ""Paul is
dead, miss him, miss him, miss him."" That interpretation seems
unlikely now, but there is a mysterious low muttering between the
songs.
Findings: The mumbling is actually just to the ""I'm So Tired"" side of
the shiny ""space"" between cuts on the record. Each of the stereo
tracks was recorded separately, twice, and a copy of each track was
reversed. This produced four versions of the two-second passage: right
forward, left forward, right reversed, and left reversed. All were
equally unintelligible. It was not even apparent whether the voice is
forward or reversed. Nor could John Lennon be identified as the
speaker. There are nine or ten syllables. The first six (when played
forward) are a two-syllable unit repeated three times. There is little
or no difference betwen the stereo tracks. Any claimed interpretation
of the sounds seems doubtful.


""Strawberry Fields Forever""
The Beatles, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR

Rumor: It was, of course, claimed that John Lennon says ""I buried
Paul"" at the end. (It's forward, at the very end after the music
fades to complete silence, returns, and starts to fade out again.)
But Lennon told ROLLING STONE that the words are ""cranberry
sauce.""
Findings: They are ""cranberry sauce."" The ""sauce""/""Paul"" part is
indistinct, but the first syllable sounds a lot more like ""cran""
than ""I.""


""Baby You're a Rich Man""
The Beatles, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR

Rumor: On one of the tracks the line ""Baby you're a rich man too""
is sung as ""Baby you're a rich fag Jew,"" a dig at Brian Epstein.
Or some think it's ""rich fat Jew"" and claim it as evidence of
Beatle anti-Semitism.
Findings: Negative. The two stereo tracks are nearly identical.
It's always possible to hear words as similar-sounding words, but
basically, the lyrics jibe with the published version.


""Revolution 9""
The Beatles, untitled, a.k.a. THE WHITE ALBUM

Rumor: Various reversed and/or one-track speech. The reversal of
""Number nine"" to ""Turn me on, dead man"" has pretty much been
discounted as coincidence (though it appears on Congressman
Dornan's list).
Findings: Distinction between lyrics and any hidden message blurs
on ""Revolution 9."" The eight-minute cut is a montage of sounds
collected by John Lennon and Yoko Ono. It includes discordant
music, radio broadcasts, sirens, applause, gunfights, sports
cheers, the crackling of a fire, screams, a baby gurgling, a choir
singing, and much that cannot be identified. For this
investigation, ""Revolution 9"" was transcribed four times, twice on
each stereo channel. One copy of each of the tracks was reversed.
The four resulting versions were compared with each other and
against the original two-channel version.
     ""Revolution 9"" contains a lot of talking. Played in stereo,
forward, the longest stretch of understandable speech is probably
an announcer saying, ""...every one of them knew that as time went
by they'd get a little bit older and a little bit slower...""
     One believable instance of reversed speech occurs: someone
saying ""Let me out! Let me out!"" (once held to represent McCartney
in his totaled Aston-Martin). Two iffy reversals occur on the
backward recording of the right stereo track:""She used to be
assistant"" and ""There were two men..."" Neither is clear enough or
long enough to be convincing. Some of the music, including the
recurring theme, sounds more natural in reverse.
     ""Turn me on, dead man"" is a typical phonetic reversal. The
forward ""number nine"" (repeated throughout the cut) is clear; the
reversal is slurred -- something like ""turn me on dedmun."" It has
been claimed that ""number nine"" must be pronounced with a British
accent or with some careful inflection in order to reverse to
""Turn me on, dead man."" This seems not to be so. As an experiment,
three American-accent renderings of ""number nine"" were reversed.
All sound about as much like ""Turn me on, dead man"" as the record
did. Like the other phonetic reversals, ""Turn me on, dead man""
must be considered a coincidence.
     Much of ""Revolution 9"" is on one stereo track only. Near the
end a voice says ""A fine natural imbalance...the Watusi...the
twist...Eldorado...Eldorado."" ""A fine natural imbalance"" is on the
right track only, though the words that follow are in stereo. One
of the longer bits of speech -- ""Who could tell what he was
saying? His voice was low and his [unintelligible] was high and
his eyes were low"" -- is clear on the left track, a bare whisper
on the right.
     There is a stereophonically concealed ""secret message"" on
""Revolution 9."" The words are on the right track. They begin about
four minutes, fifty-eight seconds into the cut and run for about
twenty-two seconds. They are not likely to be noticed in stereo
because of the much louder left track. The sound of applause
begins on the left track at about five minutes, one second into
the cut. Deafening noises -- the clapping, sirens, music --
continue on the left track until five minutes, forty seconds. It
may or may not have been Lennon's and Ono's intention to conceal
the spoken passage. Given the haphazard quality of ""Revolution 9,""
the concealment may have been accidental. To recover the passage,
the left track must be switched off. The right track can then be
heard to contain a sound like a stopwatch ticking, behind these
words:

     So the wife called, and we better go to see a
     surgeon....[A SCREAM MUFFLES A LINE THAT SOUNDS LIKE
     Well, what with the prices, the prices have snowballed,
     no wonder it's closed.] ...So any and all, we went to
     see the dentist instead, who gave him a pair of teeth,
     which wasn't any good at all. So instead of that he
     joined the bloody navy and went to sea.
                      by William Poundstone
                              1986

     There really are backward messages on rock albums. And the
controversy over ""backward masking"" and ""porn rock"" has inspired a
whole new spate of messages. There may have been more genuine
backward messages in the past few years than ever before.
     The backward message controversy is usually traced to the
1960s and John Lennon's avant-garde sound mixing on such tracks as
""Revolution 9"" on the Beatles' WHITE ALBUM. Lennon probably wasn't
trying to conceal a message so much as create an interesting
sound.
     The matter might have ended right there had it not been for
the Paul McCartney death rumor. College kids tried playing Beatles
records forward, backward, and at various speeds to find ""clues""
to McCartney's fate. In the process they found snippets of speech
from Lennon's experiments. Even after McCartney was found safe and
sound in Scotland, some listeners continued to look for hidden
messages.
     Somehow, fundamentalist Christian groups became convinced
(ca. 1982) that the alleged messages were commercials for devil
worship. Not a single indisputable satanic message has turned up,
but there were scattered attempts to ban or label certain albums.
In 1986 one fundamentalist group announced that the theme song for
the old MR. ED TV show contains the word ""Satan"" when played
backward.)
     Ironically, the publicity accorded nonexistent messages has
inspired several artists -- among them porn rock hearing witness
Frank Zappa -- to hide real background messages in their music.
It's easy to do.
     The performer speaks or sings the message normally, then
reverses the tape, which is mixed into the soundtrack. This is all
accomplished simply enough at any recording studio.
     What's not so simple is playing it back. More home record,
cassette, and compact disk players won't play backward. You can
turn a record backward with a pencil eraser, but it's not good for
the needle or the turntable. The only way to reproduce the message
with full fidelity is to use a professional-quality reel-to-reel
tape player and splice the tape in backward.
     We used the facilities of KLOS radio in Los Angeles to
reverse some recent records containing true backward messages.


""Secret Messages""
Electric Light Orchestra, SECRET MESSAGES

ELO's ELDORADO album was among those alleged to contain satanic
backward masked messages. A patient listening to ELDORADO played
backward reveals no such messages. You hear only what you ought to
hear -- the reversed lyrics of the songs, which sound nothing like
the ""messages"" claimed to be there. In the wake of such
allegations, ELO did put an (innocuous) backward message on their
FACE THE MUSIC album. Perhaps they thought this would show how
silly the allegations were. Instead, the backward-masking people
seized on this as proof that the other ""messages"" were real. In
the latest volley, ELO has named an album after the controversy.
     In Britain (where the backward-masking issue is viewed as an
American eccentricity), the cover of SECRET MESSAGES has a mock
warning label to youth about the hidden label. Word of the albums'
impending release in the United States caused enough of a furor to
chill CBS Records into deleting the cover blurb.
     The reversed message is easy to find. It's at the beginning
of the first song, which is itself called ""Secret Messages."" You
can hear reversed speech when you play the record normally. A
voice intones ""secret messages"" -- forward -- in the middle of the
reversed speech, lest anyone dare be so unhip as to not know
what's going on.
     We transferred a new copy of SECRET MESSAGES to reel-to-reel
tapes and played it backward. The backward message goes: ""WELCOME
TO THE BIG SHOW/ WELCOME TO THE BIG SHOW.""
     That's it.


""Ya Hozna""
Frank Zappa, THEM OR US

""Ya Hozna,"" a six-minute composition on the first record of the
THEM OR US double album, is ENTIRELY backward. The albums' inner
cover, which includes lyrics for the other songs, says, ""backwards
vocal -- you figure it out"" of this cut. It credits Frank and Moon
Zappa, George Duke, and Napoleon Murphy Brock as vocalists.
     Played forward, ""Ya Howza"" sounds like a record played
backward -- reasonably so. The vocals are prominent and
unintelligible. Moon Zappa's voice is curiously recognizable, even
in reverse. It is hard to tell whether the music was recorded
forward or backward.
     When ""Ya Howza"" is played in reverse, you discover that the
music is virtually a palindrome -- it sounds about the same
forward and backward. The voices are all backward. In some cases
they have been modified electronically. Many of the words are
muffled. Even after repeated careful listening on both stereo
tracks, it is difficult to make out many of the lyrics. It doesn't
help that some of the words seem to be stream-of-consciousness
nonsense. Some of the unintelligible stuff sounds like opera.
     Starting at the beginning of the reversed tape -- the end of
the forward tape -- the clearer vocals go like this: ""I am the
heaven, I am the water."" This is in a hymnlike register. ""You are
a lonely little girl./ But your mommy and your daddy hold you."" A
singsong synthesizer voice.
     The most interesting part of the lyrics is an intermittently
orgasmic rap in Moon Zappa's Valley Girl voice. There are three
short monologues:

I'm like green!
I'm like squat!
I'm like soul!
Repeat, like soul!
I'm like pull, push,
Okay, like slow, slow.

You're never too old
Like slow, like slow, like slow
Okay, I like it.


All right, faster, faster,
Go, do it, do it twice,
Yeah, that feels good,
I'm looking great,
Yeah, fer shure!
Like, no way!


""No Anchovies, Please""
J. Geils Band, LOVE STINKS

""No Anchovies, Please"" is a novelty song, really a narration with
sound effects, about a woman who is kidnapped after eating
anchovies. She is taken to a ""foreign-speaking"" country. The sound
effect of the foreign tongue seems reversed. When you do play it
in reverse, it becomes: ""It doesn't take a genius to know the
difference between chicken shit and chicken salad.""


""Darling Nikki""
Prince, PURPLE RAIN

""Darling Nikki,"" cited as porn rock before Congress, is about a
dominatrix in a hotel lobby masturbating with a magazine. In part,
the complaint was that the album cover (flowers, and Prince on a
motorcycle) wasn't explicit enough to warn kids of the suggestive
lyrics. Senator Paula Hawkins apparently was not aware of a
backward message hidden in ""Darling Nikki."" The last thirty-five
seconds of the song is gibberish. The music changes abruptly and
becomes a repeated glottal sound. Then a two-syllable sound is
repeated twice, something like ""heaven, heaven."" Unintelligible
speech follows. At the end is a sound reminiscent of rain or bacon
frying , and wind sounds.
     Played backward, the message becomes:

     Hello, how are you?
     I'm fine 'cause I know that the Lord is coming soon.
     Coming, coming soon.

     It is clearly Prince and the Revolution singing this. The
words are clear but the intonation is funny -- the linger on some
words. Perhaps this is to make the reversed message you hear
playing the record normally a little less conspicuous.
     This is a weird reversal of the supposed secret message
menace. Raunchy forward lyrics conceal a religious secret message.


""Judas Kiss""
Petra, MORE POWER TO YOU

Petra is an obscure group that sings religious songs to a rock
beat. As further proof that things have gone full circle, the
backward-masking controversy prompted Petra to include a wholesome
backward message on their MORE POWER TO YOU album. It is in the
transition between two songs, just before ""Judas Kiss."" Clearly
audible gibberish reverses to this (the husky voice a cross
between George Beverly Shea and Dee Snider): ""What are you looking
for the Devil for, when you ought to be looking for the Lord?""

AFL JoyceM Welcome to the Apple II Music & Sound chat - our discussion will
           be on NoiseTracker - the new FTA music program for the GS.  AFA
           Gene will be our host this evening...Gene, the floor is yours :)

AFA Gene   Hi all... well first I'd like to point out, if y'all aren't aware
           yet, that a spanking new version of NoiseTracker has recently
           been released (9 days ago) and is now available in our New Files
           library. It is version 0.5. I haven't played around with it much
           yet, but it's supposed to fix a lot of the little bugs in 0.3
           (the first version we had online).  NoiseTracker also includes
           the ability to directly import ""modules,"" a term used for a
           certain type of Amiga song file which has become popular among PC
           users using the SoundBlaster sound card.

           Now, via NT, these ""MOD"" files are accessible by the GS. We
           expect to see a lot of activity on this end as far as ports from
           the PC and Amiga go. Note that you should be able to go straight
           to the PC music forum and download any recently uploaded MOD
           songfiles (there was a bug in the first wide release of the PCAO
           software, however, so a bunch of files with dates between around
           March 1991 and September 1991 may not download properly. Note that
           to use these PC MOD files, you'll have to rename the downloaded
           file ""MOD.xxxxxx"" if you want it to show up automatically in NT's
           ""open"" dialog box. (On the PC, all MOD files are named
           ""xxxxxxxx.MOD"" instead.)   Also, if the files are packed with ZIP
           compression, you'll need a program from the Communications Forum
           called AGATE -- it's a terminal program that includes the ability
           to unpack ZIP files.

           Now, I guess the best thing to do would be to talk about our
           favorite songfiles... there have been a few complaints, in fact,
           that people were not being ""descriptive"" enough in their file
           descriptions for uploads in describing the songs.

AFC Eddie  ?

AFA Gene   GA ed

AFC Eddie  Once a MOD file is unpacked with Agate, is a file type change
           needed?

AFA Gene   Nope, since all that NT looks for is the ""MOD."" being the first
           four characters in the filename.

AFC Eddie  OK, Thanks!

Deanna7332 Question...

JonL7      Can you list some of the features of Noisetracker?

AFA Gene   (you don't even need that ""MOD."" if you want to type the name in
           directly.)

Deanna7332 Did any of these mod files have anything to do with FTA's ""Module
           A""

AFA Gene   Sure Jon, right after we answer Deanna's question. Deanna, you
           mean ""Modulae?""

Deanna7332 Yes, that's it.

AFA Gene   Modulae was a demo written by FTA last year. (i'll get to you in a
           sec Doors).  It used SoundSmith v0.95 for all it's music. There
           is no connection between MOD files and Modulae by FTA.

Deanna7332 Throughout the demo it said ""Loading modules""

AFA Gene   Those ""modules"" are not the same as Amiga soundfile ""modules"" --
           you see, what Modulae really was was a ""stringing together"" of a
           bunch of neat little tiny demos that FTA had written. So they
           called each little demo a ""module"" and thus the entire demo as a
           whole, ""Modulae"" (fancy plural of module?)

Deanna7332 Ok I understand.  Thank you. :)

AFL JoyceM Latin, Gene :)

AFA Gene   The term ""MODule"" from the Amiga comes from the idea that all the
           stuff needed to play the songfile (all the instruments + the
           sequence file) are included into one file, the ""module.""

TheDoors1  Gene, I have tried to d/l some recent uploaded MODs in the PC
           music area and still the problem exists.

AFA Gene   As I understand it, the problem was fixed VERY recently (correct
           me on this Joyce) and files uploaded as recently as early
           November still might not work depending on the version of the
           PCAO software that the uploader used.

AFL JoyceM Actually, Gene...I was under the impression that it had been, but
           if Doors is still having a problem, then it must not be fixed.

AFA Gene   What date was the file you tried to d/l, Door?

TheDoors1  umm 11/17, around there

AFA Gene   hmmm.... well i can tell you one thing... if it didn't work, don't
           waste your time again later... the problem is in the Apple
           software's method of d/lling files, and there are no plans to
           upgrade the Apple AO software.

AFL JoyceM I will endeavor to get an answer to that PC downloading
           problem/question :)

ThomasK63  i have a quick question... what can you use to unpack amiga mod
           files? On the PC side, that is.

TheDoors1  Agate Thomas

ELECTMUSIC Doors... what happens on after downloading..

Deanna7332 If it's LZHed you can't unless you have an IBM or
           PC/Transporter.

AFA Gene   If GS-ShrinkIt doesn't have that ability, i don't think there
           exists any such utility on the GS.

TheDoors1  What do you mean Elect?

ELECTMUSIC After you download the file... where do you encounter a problem?

TheDoors1  ok, you know when you download the file and at some point in the
           download the file starts to appear on your screen.  That's when I
           cancel it.

ThomasK63  I am sure soething good can be made w/out resorting to Amiga
           files

AFC Eddie  Yes, Doors, I believe the problem is with the PC software it was
           UL'd with.

TheDoors1  yeah Eddie.

GNO Tim    Amiga MOD files are typically compressed using LHarc.  I've
           uncompressed several on my Unix machine at school.

ThomasK63  good time for someone to make a lharc unpacker...

AFC DYAJim someone might be ;)

GNO Tim    Several people are already

AFC Eddie  Can't wait, Jim!

AFA Gene   Jon, did you have a question?

JonL7      The features of Noisetracker :)

AFA Gene   Oh yes... okay, here goes, in a nutshell, from most important to
           least:


AFA Gene   *  ability to import MOD files

           *  ability to import Soundsmith files

           *  ProDOS 8 based

           *  virtually no editing abilities (not a feature but important to
           know)

AFC DYAJim :)

AFA Gene   *  forgot: and the most important feature of all, the ability to
           hold instrument files in regular system RAM instead of DOC RAM,
           allowing for instruments far beyond the regular 64K limit found
           in ALL other GS music programs.

ThomasK63  I'll buy that!

TheDoors1  I have another question...when you're ready.

AFA Gene   GA Doors

TheDoors1  ok..is it true that NoiseTracker will take in soundsmith files and
           play them more clearly

AFA Gene   Well, as far as ""what you hear,"" yes there is a definite
           difference with some instruments. It does NOT play the sounds
           more ""clearly,"" but it just plays them in a different way. What
           many people seem to like about this ""different way"" is that
           sustained instruments (i.e. instruments designed to be played
           in a loop to simulate a long held note) seem to work better (or
           perhaps simply the way they were originally intended to work).

TheDoors1  I see

Deanna7332 Which takes up more space - MOD or NT  w/soundfile ?

AFA Gene   Deanna, it depends a few things, such as how big the sequence is,
           how many instruments you have, etc. Once you have a lot of
           assorted files, it'll probably average out to be about the same
           give or take a hundred blocks on your HD. So it basically depends
           on whether you prefer to have your instruments separate or not.

Deanna7332 Does playing quality differ with either one ?

AFA Gene   Nope. It's exactly the same either way. Loading time is the same
           too.

AFC Eddie  Can NT save songs as MOD files?

AFA Gene   Nope. It has options for Open and Close module, but these are
           still inactive.

AFA Gene   If there are no more questions, I'd like to talk about which NT
           files out there are the ""hottest,"" since this info could be
           useful to many users who are interested in downloading NT/MOD
           files.

           My personal favorite is ""Lambada,"" which is supplied by FTA with
           the program but is available separately on America
           Online.Everything about this file is really impressive except
           perhaps the sound quality of the horn-ish melody instrument.

           What about y'all, what are your favorite NT files?

AFL JoyceM Gene, there is a classical song for NT, but can't remember the
           name, but it is good.

AFC Eddie  I like Dragnet!

ELECTMUSIC So do I Ed

TheDoors1  I like Seven something

Deanna7332 My most favorite of all mod files is Pleasure Principle

AFC Eddie  <--appreciate's Greg's taste!

AFL JoyceM :)

AFA Gene   Deanna, i assume you got that from a local board?

Deanna7332 I got it from the PC forum here.

TheDoors1  I saw it there also

Deanna7332 I think under ""Pleasure""

AFA Gene   Would you be able to upload it here? If it's really that good, we
           ought to have it available directly in our oun NT lib here (BTW
           folks, we will be releasing a new NoiseTracker software library
           soon!)

AFC Eddie  What a Forum!!!

Deanna7332 That sounds great!

AFL JoyceM Gene, do you think it will be possible for synthLAB files to be
           converted to MOD files?

AFL JoyceM MOD files?

AFA Gene   I doubt it, Joyce. The formats are so diametrically opposed in
           their entire basis of their file formats that it wouldn't be
           worth the time for a programmer to develop such a convertor.

Deanna7332 Isn't it possible to move the mod file from the PC forum to our
           music library?

AFA Gene   But..... it might be worth the time for a MIDI File Format to MOD
           convertor, since these two formats are more widely accepted.

Nuzz       they have nothing better to do Gene

ELECTMUSIC Gene.. some interesting similarities with DTune and NTracker

AFA Gene   They lose the file, tho, Deanna. :)

AFL JoyceM In what way, Greg?

ELECTMUSIC Both Prodos 8

Deanna7332 Shhh they won't know a thing :)

ELECTMUSIC I also believe Bill uses a shuttling of sound data between Doc
           Ram and Ram.

AFC Eddie  Interesting, Greg.

ELECTMUSIC Thats how he gets some of the excellent instrument quality

AFC Eddie  But Diversitune has that one distinction:  MIDI input.

AFL JoyceM Deanna, we would greatly appreciate it if you would upload that
           'Pleasure' song to our library :)

ELECTMUSIC Agreed Ed.. one of the factors FTA doesn't like to incorporate
           into their programs.

Deanna7332 I'll u/l it tonight if possible.

AFL JoyceM Thanks :)

AFC Eddie  Thanks, Deanna!

AFL JoyceM I will send Bill B a copy of NoiseTracker + some MOD files...to
           see what comments we get from him (will send when I get back).

AFC DYAJim What ever happened to that diversitune upgrade that was talked
           about ?

ELECTMUSIC That would be interesting Joyce

AFC Eddie  Bill apparently still working on it, Jim.

ELECTMUSIC I am sure he would appreciate the Prodos 8

AFC DYAJim good..

AFL JoyceM Jim...RSN....he was hoping by Christmas (this year), but he is
           soooo busy with his job, who knows?

AFC DYAJim Oh yeah, I noticed the speed calcuation in NT .5 is inaccurate
           :)

AFC DYAJim I recall he has set a lot of Christmas projected dates :)

ELECTMUSIC He was one of the first ""Free Tools"" experts in breaking all the
           rules for economic sake.

AFC DYAJim like for the vaporware DT inst editor like 2 years ago.

Deanna7332 Are there any Christmas Mod or NT songs?

AFC Eddie  Oh yeah, Diversi-Editor!

AFL JoyceM I know, Jim - but that I know he has been working on.

AFC DYAJim he projected Christmas for it, and it never came :)

AFA Gene   Not yet in AMS, but hopefully the Holiday Contest will change all
           that. :)

AFC DYAJim I look foreward to any upgrades..

AFL JoyceM Not that I am aware of Deanna - you have some?  hint, hint

Deanna7332 Nope sorry.  I was hoping there were some that could be u/led
           here

AFC DYAJim I'll be breaking out the xmas tune book rsn.. I should be able to
           midi a few :) (which rules out nt)

AFL JoyceM Question...

AFC Eddie  It would be more appropriate to have a converter from Appleworks
           spreadsheet to MOD than from MIDI!

AFL JoyceM If I got ahold of an Amiga song (MOD) disk...how would I convert
           them for here?

AFA Gene   You mean an Amiga-formatted disk?

AFL JoyceM Yes

AFC DYAJim Ack.. methinks you need an amiga and a null modem cable or a
           modem.

AFA Gene   Methinks Jim is right

AFC DYAJim LOL!!  Design your music in the spreadsheet then import to NT :)
           IT might actually have better editing?!! :)

AFC Eddie  Right!

AFL JoyceM Me thinks he is right.  If I had them upload to me, would that
           work?

AFA Gene   Yep; should work like a charm.

AFC DYAJim Yah.. as long as they're coming from an amiga

AFL JoyceM Great....I will work on that when I get back  (making note now).

AFL JoyceM Gene, will you get some of those files (NT) sent to that area
           tonight?  If so, I will leave the needed message :)

AFA Gene   That's all I have planned for tonight's chat, Joyce. Yep, I'll
           move some files right now.

AFL JoyceM Thanks...

AFL JoyceM Then we should have our NoiseTracker Library by end of the week in
           AMS :)

ELECTMUSIC Gene... quick question:  Are you launching NTracker from a 3.5
           disk?

AFL JoyceM Okay, guys...I will see you all the week of December 11th (may the
           4th) as I am off on vacation.

AFA Gene   Yep greg

AFC JohnC  Where are you going?

ELECTMUSIC Do you encounter out of memory problems

AFL JoyceM Night all...and Gene, thanks for an excellent chat and great
           explanations of NoiseTracker.

Nuzz       Joyce, I have good news for FutureSound owners. SoundConvert will
           support it in the first release

AFC Eddie  Great, Mike!

AFA Gene   Greg, i always keep my RAMdisk at 0 when using noisetracker. Not
           only are

AFC JohnC  Mike...SoundConvert...released?

AFL JoyceM Great, Mike.  When can we get SoundConvert, Mike? and FutureSound
           :)

AFA Gene   there a couple of bugs with memory management, but if you're
           loading in a MOD file that's really big, NT will eat your RAMdisk.

AFC Eddie  Sounds good.

Nuzz       The manual is being ""layout"". Release date should be about 1st
           week of Dec

ELECTMUSIC Tnxs Gene

AFC JohnC  YES.......WTG Nuzz!!!!!!!!

Deanna7332 Yes, why is there on some MOD files a stop somewhere in the middle
           ?

Deanna7332 That's really frustrating!

AFL JoyceM Mike, leave me E-Mail on when and how I can send your the $$ to
           get it.

AFL JoyceM Again...night all

Nuzz       gee John, I had to do something to explain the delay :)

ELECTMUSIC Thanks Gene for a GREAT chat!

AFC Eddie  Yes, Gene!  Great!

AFA Gene   Thanks Greg, 'night!

AFA Gene   thanx, see y'all later :)

techniques.


NINE PATCH WONDERS
by Blanche Young and Helen Young Frost
First Star publishers, Tucson, Arizona  1991

Shows what can be done with a nine patch block (interesting color plays,
optical illusions, three dimensional woven effects).

The best of traditional designs as well as some original variations.  Some
quilts are made with all Nine Patch blocks; others combine the pieced blocks
with background blocks.  Others are variations on the Double Nine Patch design,
where pieced blocks are joined with plain squares to form large Nine Patch
blocks.  Combining the 9Patch with other shapes, such as rectangles or
triangles, creates even more variations.

Great book.

as designs an experienced quiltmaker will enjoy working with.  Popular and
traditional patterns--and all the instructions for the techniques required to
make them.

The patterns are arranged in a progressive sequence, incorporating new designs
and utilizing more difficult techniques as you move from the simpler patterns
to the more complex.  Some patterns require more precise work than others, but
with careful work all can be completed by the quiltmaker who begins with the
simpler patterns, moving onward as experience warrants.


QUILTS, QUILTS, AND MORE QUILTS
by McClun and Nownes.

This book is just as good as their first book (see above).

by Eleanor Burns
Quilt in a Day Series 1990

Good book for making stars.


QUILT PROJECTS BY MACHINE
by Singer, 1992

There is a small section on Bow Ties (about a half doz or so pages) in this
book.  It shows several arrangements: traditional, zigzag, octagonal,
staggered.
There are a couple of neat arrangements using color (oh, no, I'm starting
to write ""American""!) gradations, as well as scrap, necktie fabrics and
amish colours.  It gives a couple of ideas for borders and sashings as well.


QUILTS SEW QUILT
by Nancy J. Smith and Lynda Milligan

This is the one that has the Ivy Trellis Pattern in it that I asked about on
QuiltNet last fall and noone could find the pattern for.  It has a number of
other interesting patterns in it for large print fabrics.


QUILT ALMANAC 19xx
by Oxmoor House

These are some of my favorites too. The quilts range from very simple
to very difficult. The patterns are good and I enjoy the biographies.

I expect I'll see a QuiltNet quilt featured there!


120 Patterns for Traditional Patchwork Quilts
by Maggie Malone
Sterling Publishing, NY  1983

Patterns range from easy to hard; from well-known designs to more obscure
patterns.  Some of the patterns you may have never seen before since they were

instructions and pattern pieces for making twenty of them.  Over 100 examples
of how quilts can personalize every room in the house, adding color and graphic
impact to any space.


EAST QUILTS WEST ($24.95)
by Kumiko Sodo

It is wonderful!!!  She has many patterns that have  instructions for an
average to advanced quilter.  Her patterns are not,  on the most part, for the
faint of heart.  The best part, is the ideas  which spring forth from her many
designs.  I very, very seldom use a  design, even if given permission - I like
to make my own designe.  Her  book is an inspiration.  I hate to piece curves,
so I have been  appliqueing them down on top of the under piece after turning
under the  edge.  This is how she ""pieces"" her curves.  The book is rich in
color  and in interestingly narrated.  Her use of color is wonderful.
It is not a cheap book, but I would definitely recommend it.


** Reference (Historical) **


CONTEMPORARY QUILTS FROM TRADITIONAL DESIGNS ($9.50 used)
by Carolyn L. Mosey
E. P. Dutton Publishers, New York 1988

This book takes a comparative look at the physical changes in the art of
quilting through the years.  While the overall appearance of quilts has
changed, many contemporary quiltmakers keep coming back to traditional
patterns.  The artists represented in this book share their feelings on the
history of quilting, the direction in which it is going and their viewpoints on
several quilt-related topics.

Interesting.  Provides a traditional quilt on one side of the page and a
quilter's contemporary rendition of the same pattern on the other.


FABULOUS FABRICS OF THE 50s (And Other Terrific Textiles of the
20s, 30s, and 40s)
by Gideon Bosker, John Gramstad, Michele Mancini
Chronicle Books, San Francisco.

This one focuses on drape/upholstry fabrics of those years and is great for the
history and wonderful (often weird) color combinations of the fabrics.


SIGNS AND SYMBOLS:  African Images in African-American Quilts ($24.00)
by Maude Southwell Wahlman
Studio Books in association with Museum of American Folk Art, New York

This book introduces the art of African-American quiltmaking to the general
public.  Her thesis is that most African-American quiltmaking derives its
aesthetic from various African traditionsk, both technological and ideological.


Provides an abundance of detailed information on African textiles, the history
of quiltmaking in India, Europe and the Americas and extensive interviews with
quilters.

Excellent.


STAR QUILTS ($20)
by Mary Elizabeth Johnson
Clarkson Potter Publishers

Good collection of star quilts.
----
I like this book. She is well organized and gives you some good photos and
directions. Haven't tried anything from it yet. (I got it from a closeout
catalog for under $10. It's a good deal at that price. Not sure if I'd pay
$20 for it though.)


QUILT STORIES
by Cecilia Macheski, editor
Lexington: The University of Kentucky Press, 1994.

This wonderful book is a collection of poems, short stories, and other prose
works by various authors over the past 150-200 years, all dealing somehow with
quilts and quilting.  The book is divided into 5 sections (""blocks""), each
named for specific quilt blocks: Memory Blocks (""Stories of Remembrance and
Meaning""), Double Wedding Ring (""Stories of Community and Courtship""), Radical
Rose (""Stories of Struggle and Change""), Wheel of Mystery (""Stories of Murder
and Mystery""), and Old Maid's Ramble (""Stories of Age and Wisdom"").  The
introduction explains the blocks and the stories a bit, and the editor explains
how quilting provided an important link in literature written by women
(although there are a couple of selections from male authors).


REMEMBER ME; Women and their Friendship Quilts
Lipsett, Linda Otto.
San Francisco, Quilt Digest Press, 1985.
Pb, 140 p, col & b/w ill.

One of the very best quilt books ever Linda Otto Lipsett began with her own
collection of 19th century  friendship quilts. Her book tells the stories of
eight women and eight  quilts made between 1840 and 1895. Many of the stories
are sad stories  of leaving family and comfortable homes in the East to
undertake arduous  journeys in pursuit of new homes in the West. Using letters,
diaries,  interviews and the quilts themselves the author unfolds the everyday
lives of eight real women, following them from youth to old age. Photos  show
the women, their families, their homes, and especially their quilts.  The
excellent color photographs show full quilts, details of blocks,  signatures
and ornaments, and the best close-ups of 19th century fabrics  I have seen.
There are also pictures of other typical friendship quilts,  patterns for three
quilts prepared by Laura Nownes, and complete  references and bibliography.


MY MOTHER'S QUILTS/DESIGNS FROM THE THIRTIES
by Sara Nephew,
That Patchwork Place

I love this one -- it really got me into 30s quilts -- and it's my inspiration,
since I just purchased two 30s tops that need batting, backing,etc.


FOLK QUILTS AND HOW TO RECREATE THEM ($14.95)
by Audrey & Douglas Wiss
Sterling/Main Street, NY 1990

This book presents a wide selection of traditional designs for the modern
quilter which have been tested over time.  They are presented in their original
colors and special configurations.  Some date back as far as the 18th century;
others became popular as late as the 1930s.  A few are worked in wool or silk;
most are piecd of plain or printed cottons.  All were made in America and
display a variety of piecing, applique and quilting techniques.
I like this collection.

Buy it, it's gorgeous and you will learn a ton of stuff about
quilting that you never know--extremely well researched, beautifully

a time line about quilt styles and fabrics. The photographs are

EPM Publications, 1989.

There are black and white and color pictures and examples and descriptions of
quilts characteristic of different periods. It is one of the best researched
and written quilt books I have encountered, and I have more than 300 books. I
put this in the top ten. Libraries and quilt guilds should have it.

NEW QUILTING AND PATCHWORK DICTIONARY, THE  ($12.95)

New York: Dover, 1993.

This is the book for anyone interested in Seminole patchwork.  I have two other
books on the topic and have seen others at the library--THIS is the one to buy.

----
It's a reprint of the 1982 edition which has been out of print for some time.

Seminole patchwork.  This is the first book I've seen that's had something of
an accurate history, too.


QUILT CLIP ART   ($10.95)
by Cheryl Petersen
Quiltessence/Fine Publications

It's a nice little book that has all kinds of sewing-related images, quilt
borders,  the word QUILT in various fonts and stylings, little quilts
flying pigs, thimbles and thread.

The nice part about this publisher is that you can order DISKS of
all the clip art (a necessity if you don't own a scanner!)  The clip
art is available for MACs in pict form on 3.5"" disks.  It is also
available for the IBM or clone, but you must call or write to them and
give them your graphic requirements.


COLOR WASH WORKBOOK ($12.95)
by Shirley Liby
Graphics Unlimited, 1993

This book is the result of Liby's creative play and her approach to the process
of color wash through a series of modules that seemed to simplify the whole
idea for her.

I like this book because it is in black and white and, therefore, easier to
separate values.  There are also a lot of grids that you can copy and play
around with your own designs.

Summa Design

These designs are cleverly constructed so that they can be continuously
sewn on the machine.  Five classic designs are included and 8 new designs.
They could all be handsewn if you wanted to do that.  Each is given in
two sizes.


JACKET JAZZ ($21.95)

AQS

One woman in my guild made a jacket in it and just raved about
the book.  She said it was totally lucid, thorough, etc.
----
This book has a nifty way to make Prairie Points from a strip of fabric.  I've
tried it for trim on a vest and it was very easy.
----
This book has 5 wonderful jacket patterns in it. In the book, she shows how to
do 36 different things to put on a jacket. A few will look very familiar to
most quilters such as a strip of flying geese, though making it without cutting
any triangles may be a new technique. Some such as woven prairie points I had
never seen or heard mentioned before, though I know we have mentioned the
standard prairie points before.

I have a number of state-oriented quilt history books and this one, which
focuses more on the quilts than the makers, I find to be outstanding.

In steps 2 and 3 the algorithm calculates a sequence t(i) of the recursion
where
by means (6.16)
(6.17)

 is the already familiar function that is induced by the Montgomery equation (cf. (6.13), and there set r ← B in f (t)). The members of the sequence t(i) have the properties
t(i) ≡ 0 mod Bi, t(i) ≡ ab mod n,

(6.21)

  110
Properties (6.18) and (6.19) are derived inductively from (6.14), (6.15), (6.16), and (6.17); from (6.18) we obtain Bl | t(l) ⇔ r | t(l). From this and from
t(l) ≡ ab mod n follows (6.20), and lastly we have (6.21) on account of l−1
(l) (0)   i l t =t +n miB<2nB
i=0
(note here that t(0) = ab < n2 < nBl).
The expenditure for the reduction is now determined essentially by
multiplication of numbers of order of magnitude the size of the modulus. This variant of Montgomery multiplication can be elegantly implemented in code that forms the core of the multiplication routine mul_l() (cf. page 36).

 int i;
 mult (a_l, b_l, t_l);
 lasttnptr = t_l + DIGITS_L (n_l);
 lastnptr = MSDPTR_L (n_l);
   The earlier use of mult() makes possible the multiplication of a_l and b_l without the possibility of overflow (see page 72); for the Montgomery squaring we simply insert sqr(). The result has sufficient space in t_l. Then t_l is given leading zeros to bring it to double the number of digits of n_l if t_l is smaller than this.

Chapter 6
for (i = DIGITS_L (t_l) + 1; i <= (DIGITS_L (n_l) << 1); i++)
 {
t_l[i] = 0; }
SETDIGITS_L (t_l, MAX (DIGITS_L (t_l), DIGITS_L (n_l) << 1));
for (tptr_l = LSDPTR_L (t_l); tptr_l <= lasttnptr; tptr_l++)
 {
  carry = 0;
  mi = (USHORT)((ULONG)nprime * (ULONG)*tptr_l);
  for (nptr_l = LSDPTR_L (n_l), tiptr_l = tptr_l;
    nptr_l <= lastnptr; nptr_l++, tiptr_l++)
   {
    *tiptr_l = (USHORT)(carry = (ULONG)mi * (ULONG)*nptr_l +
      (ULONG)*tiptr_l + (ULONG)(USHORT)(carry >> BITPERDGT));
   }

   {
    *tiptr_l = (USHORT)(carry >> BITPERDGT);
    INCDIGITS_L (t_l);
   }
}
   Within the following double loop the partial products minBi with mi := tin 0 are calculated one after the other and added to t_l. Here again the code is essentially that of our multiplication function.
    In the following inner loop a possible overflow is transported to the most- significant digit of t_l, and t_l contains an additional digit in case it is needed. This step is essential, since at the start of the main loop t_l was given a value and not initialized via multiplication by 0 as was the variable p_l.
 112
Where All Roads Meet: Modular Exponentiation
   Now follows division by Bl, and we shift t_l by logB_r digits to the right, or ig- nore the logB_r least-significant digits of t_l. Then if applicable the modulus n_l is subtracted from t_l before t_l is returned as result into p_l.
  tptr_l = t_l + (logB_r);
 SETDIGIT_L (tptr_l, DIGITS_L (t_l) - (logB_r));
 if (GE_L (tptr_l, n_l))
  {
   sub_l (tptr_l, n_l, p_l);
} else
  {
   cpy_l (p_l, tptr_l);
} }
The Montgomery squaring sqrmon_l() differs from this function only marginally: There is no parameter b_l in the function call, and instead of multiplication with mult(a_l, b_l, t_l) we employ the squaring function sqr(a_l, t_l), which likewise ignores a possible overflow. However, in modular squaring in the Montgomery method one must note that after the calculation of p  ← a  ×a  thereversetransformationp←p  ×1=p r−1 =a2 modnmust be calculated explicitly (cf. page 108).

 In their article Dussé and Kaliski also present the following variant of the extended Euclidean algorithm, to be dealt with in detail in Section 10.2, for calculating n 0 = n  mod B, with which the expenditure for the precalculations can be reduced. The algorithm calculates −n−1 mod 2s for an s > 0 and for this requires long-number arithmetic.

With complete induction it can be shown that in step 2 of this algorithm yn≡1modxalwaysholds,andthusy≡n−1 modx.Afterxhastakenonthe value 2s in step 3, we obtain with 2s − y ≡ −n−1 mod 2s the desired result if we choose s such that 2s = B. The short function for this can be obtained under the name invmon_l() in the FLINT/C source. It takes only the modulus n as argument and outputs the value −n−1 mod B.
These considerations are borne out in the creation of the functions mexp5m_l() and mexpkm_l(), for which we give here only the interface, together with a computational example.

These functions employ the routines invmon_l(), mulmon_l(), and sqrmon_l() to compute the Montgomery products. Their implementation is based on the functions mexp5_l() and mexpk_l() modified according to the exponentiation algorithm described above.
We would like to reconstruct the processes of Montgomery exponentiation in mexpkm_l() with the same numerical example that we looked at for M-ary
exponentiation (cf. page 100). In the following steps we shall calculate the power 1234667 mod 18577:
1. Precomputations
The exponent e = 667 is represented to the base 2k with k = 2 (cf. the algorithm for Montgomery exponentiation on page 114). The exponent e thereby has the representation
e = (10 10 01 10 11)22 .
The value r for Montgomery reduction is r = 216 = B = 65536.
The value n 0 (cf. page 110) is now calculated as n 0 = 34703.
The transformation of the base a into the residue system R(r, n) (cf. page 107) follows from
a = ar mod n = 1234 · 65536 mod 18577 = 5743.
The power a3 in R(r, n) has the value a3 = 9227. Because of the small
exponent, further powers of a do not arise in the precomputation. 2. Exponentiationloop

Those interested in reconstructing the coding details of the functions mexp5m_l() and mexpkm_l() and the calculational steps of the example related to the function mexpkm_l() are referred to the FLINT/C source code.
At the start of this chapter we developed the function wmexp_l(), which has the advantage for small bases that only multiplications p ← pa mod m of the type CLINT * USHORT mod CLINT occur. In order to profit from the Montgomery procedure in this function, too, we adjust the modular squaring to Montgomery squaring, as in mexpkm_l(), with the use of the fast inverse function invmon_l(), though we leave the multiplication unchanged. We can do this because with the calculational steps for Montgomery squaring and for conventional multiplication modulo n,
  a2r−1 b≡ a2b r−1modn,

wedonotabandontheresiduesystemR(r,n) = {irmodn | 0 ≤ i < n} introduced above. This process yields us both the function wmexpm_l() and the dual function umexpm_l() for USHORT exponents, respectively for odd moduli, which in comparison to the two conventional functions wmexp_l() and umexp_l() again yields a significant speed advantage. For these functions, too, we present here only the interface and a numerical example. The reader is again referred to the FLINT/C source for details.

 The function wmexpm_l() is tailor-made for our primality test in Section 10.5, where we shall profit from our present efforts. The function will be documented with the example used previously of the calculation of 1234667 mod 18577.
1. Precalculations
The binary representation of the exponent is e = (1010011011)2 .
The value r for the Montgomery reduction is r = 216 = B = 65536. The value n 0 (cf. page 110) is calculated as above, yielding n 0 = 34703.

         Dosage:    20-30+ grammes (too many cause vomitting)
         Time:      hours to days, variable
         Available: easy to get hold of (get soluble ones, & dissolve them)
         Certainty: unreliable
         Notes:     Not recommended, fatal dose varies wildly, could cause

         Available: easy to get hold of
         Certainty: fairly reliable
         Notes:     Once 10-12 hours is up, you've had it, but you still live
                    for a week or two after that. Probably better to wait 15

                    to be a very quick way of absorbing alcohol, but a less
                    unpleasant way is to inject it. The dosage it takes to
                    kill you depends on whether you drink normally, the
                    state of your liver, whether you pass out on your back
                    or not (and probably also the phase of the moon!).

         Time:      2 to 3 hours
         Available: From a large garden centre or DIY shop
         Certainty: probable, given correct dosage
         Notes:     Drink undiluted, shake bottle first since it settles.
                    it causes diarhoea after about half an hour.

      Caffiene
         Dosage:    20 grammes
         Time:      not known
         Available: Caffiene tablets available in Chemist shops
         Certainty: don't know
         Notes:     I don't know very much about this.

      Nitrogen gas (or other inert gas)
         Dosage:    Several litres uncompressed is minimum
         Time:      Minutes
         Available: Try plumber, or welding supplies company
         Certainty: Certain
         Notes:     This is really a form of asphyxiation, (see later),
                    but is particularly good since you don't experience
                    the lack of oxygen (what people really experience is
                    the EXCESS of carbon dioxide).

      Potassium Chloride (injected in solution) / KCl
         Dosage:    not known (try 20cc injection of strong solution)
         Time:      Seconds to minutes
         Available: Widely available
         Certainty: Certain given correct dosage
         Notes:     Causes heart attack (which is painful). May be difficult
                    for coroner to realise it was suicide rather than a
                    natural heart attack. An excess of K+ in the blood
                    interferes with nerve signals, and stops muscles and
                    nerves from working. So when it reaches your heart, the
                    heart stops. Interesting to see what happens if you inject
                    it into your carotid artery, if it stops nervous tissue
                    from working.

      Rat poison (Warfarin)
         Dosage:    not known
         Time:      Hours to terminal damage, days to actual death
         Available: Available
         Certainty: Certain given suffient dosage
         Notes:     This is one of the truly unpleasant poisons, along with
                    Paracetamol/Acetylminopren. I think it causes cerebral
                    haemorage (rat poison works by giving the unfortunate rat
                    haemophillia). Doctors can't do anything about it, they
                    just leave you to die in agony on an intensive care ward.

      Chlorine gas
         Dosage:    not known - but probably sufficient generated in suggested
                    method
         Time:      not known
         Available: Get about 4 litres of concentrated bleach, and the same
                    of ammonia
         Certainty: Good
         Notes:     This was used in the first world war in the trenches, so
                    it's got to be effective. You go into a small room, block
                    off all the ventilation, and pour the bleach and ammonia
                    into a bucket. This produces chlorine, you breath it in,
                    and hey presto! I suspect that this is quite painful,
                    if you are ""rescued"" there is a danger of either lung
                    damage, or a slow lingering death.

      Digitalis (Foxglove extract?)
         Dosage:    not known
         Time:      Probably minutes
         Available: Do foxgloves grow in your area?
         Certainty: probably good given sufficient dosage
         Notes:     Gives you a heart-attack. UNDETECTABLE after death, so
                    if you don't want to let your friends/relatives to know
                    that your death was a suicide use this. I don't know
                    how to extract digitalis from foxglove, nor do I know
                    what the dosage is. Heart attacks are painful, but the
                    advantages in using an undetectable method make this
                    very attractive.

      Colchicine (Acetyltrimethylcolchicinic acid)
         Dosage:    7 mg to 60 mg
         Time:      symptoms in about 4 hours, death in about 4 days
         Available: Easily available (from large garden centre)
         Certainty: certain
         Notes:     From the Autumn crocus (Colchicum Autumnale) /
                    royal lily (Gloriosa Superba). One flower of CA is
                    about 12 mg, so take at least five of them. 20g tuber
                    of GS provides 60mg, single see

raza1@gmail.com,fun2.txt,"ad faster than anyone expected.  Merlin
created the notesfile =spam and linked it with =purgatory.
Pretty soon Spam overflowed TalkLine, =purgatory, and =spam
and went straight for the heart of =pad.
 
     =Pad is considered to be the most important and most
read notesfile in existance on NovaNET.  And Spam began to
spread through there faster than a lawyer goes to a scene of
an accident.  Pretty soon, it became a everyday occurance for
Merlin to sling Spam at the great Felixmeister -- who
regretted every minute of it.  Pretty soon everyone in =pad
got annoyed at Merlin's Spam slinging and Felix's general
attempts at just being obtrusive back at Merin -- but the
whole situation became even worse when Merlin and Crunch
began to post the entire novel ""The HitchHiker's Guide To The
Galaxy"".  And as =pad was being filled, it became much worse
on Avatar.  Avatar was soaked with Spam, and half the
population of the game regretted hearing the word of Spam --
and this broke the entire game into factions -- The Slingers
Of The Spam, The Neutral Luncheon Meat, and the Anti-Spam.
The leaders of the Anti-Spam were jude/mainei and The Lipless
One, who declared from his non-existant lips, ""No Warlock
Shall Eat Spam."" This brought on a series of events such as
frequent trips to CAPS, the place at the UM where NovaNETers
hung around.  Merlin just went there to bother the great
Lipless one as well as Crunch and Raphael Dareau on occasion.
Soon, in a fit of agony, the Lipless One yelled out at 3 in
the morning, ""Who in the HELL started this SPAM STUFF?""
Raphael Dareau and Merlin remained silent while Crunch had
disappeared within the Avatar dungeon in a desperate attempt
to escape.  Raphael Dareau just grinned brillantly and
contined to spread his creation through Epigoni, the new
leader of the Spam Slingers.  Pretty soon people began to
bribe the Slingers Of The Spam with High Powered Signons,
which did not work, and it eventually lead to death threats
from the people of CERL.
 
     However, this was all temporary -- About 3 months later
the Debmeister came out of her own universe and sucked all
the NovaNET ports from existance -- causing a chain reaction
that caused the eventual collapse of the universe in Bangor,
Maine.  Even though CAPS still exists it became a barren
wasteland.  However, frequent collisions with the NovaNET
system do occur there through the semi-godly powers of
Merlin.
 
     However, since the universe in Bangor was a barren
wasteland, The Slingers Of The Spam began to spread Spam in a
entirely new fashi

        ---------------------------------------------------------------


                            - USING THE LOVE BASE -



        Just type LOVEBASE from the DOS prompt and press the return key
        to run the program.


        All function keys are displayed on the screen.

        Select section from the menu.  Bring the menu up at any time by
        pressing the letter ""M"".

        Find text by pressing ""F"".  Use this to search for an author's
        name or for keywords.  A global search will search from the very
        first entry through to the very last.  A local search is
        considerably faster but searches only the section you are
        currently viewing.

        Repeat the last find operation by pressing ""R"".

        Print the currently displayed entry by pressing the letter ""P"".

        Send the currently displayed entry to a text file on disk by
        pressing ""T"".

        ""G""o to entry number.  Goes immediately to the entry number
        specified.

        Up and down arrow keys move through the entries one at a time.

        Pressing the spacebar moves forward through the entries one at
        a time.

        Home and end keys move to the first and last entries
        respectively.


        ---------------------------------------------------------------


                       - THE PURPOSE OF THE LOVE BASE -


            We live in an age devoid of ideals, devoid of dreams, devoid
        of hope.  The dollar is our God, television our mentor, the
        newspaper our Bible.  Drugs and sex make our heaven.  Nobody
        even thinks of perfection as we strive headlong for mediocrity
        with workman-like efficiency.

            We are dying.

            The ideal of perfect romantic love is far from being the
        loftiest of ideals.  It hardly compares with the ideals of
        knowledge and wisdom.  But the romantic ideal is far superior to
        the so-called ideals of material wealth and power.

            An ideal is the most wonderful disease, for it makes one
        totally dissatisfied with life.  Only then can one look higher,
        higher, and maybe . . . begin . . . to think.

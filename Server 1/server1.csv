THE SATANIC ROOTS OF ROCK
by Donald Phau


Today, at almost any ""heavy-metal'' rock concert one can hear the
audience being exhorted to rape and murder in the name of Satan.
Lyrics such as the following are typical:

   ""We come bursting through your bodies
   Rape your helpless soul
   Transform you into a creature
   Merciless and cold
   We force you to kill your brother
   Eat his blood and brain
   Shredding flesh and sucking bone
   Till everyone's insane

   We are pestilent and contaminate
   The world Demonic legions prevail''

   Any loving parent today would be horrified and shocked to learn
that their sons and daughters are eagerly listening to such evil.
Perhaps though, some may think privately, ""If only we could return to
the 'good old days,' with the music of the Beatles.'' Little do most
people suspect that it was with those innocent-looking Beatles, that
most of the trouble started.
   Modern electronic-rock music, inaugurated in the early 1960s, is,
and always has been, a joint enterprise of British military
intelligence and Satanic cults. On the one side, the Satanists control
the major rock groups through drugs, sex, threats of violence, and
even murder. On the otherside, publicity, tours, and recordings are
financed by record companies connected to British military
intelligence circles. Both sides are intimately entwined with the
biggest business in the world, the international drug trade.
   The so-called ""rock stars'' are pathetic puppets caught in a much
larger scheme. From the moment they receive their first recording
royalties, the groups are heavily immersed in drugs. For example,
much-admired ""stars'' such as John Lennon of the Beatles and Keith
Richard of the Rolling Stones, were heroin addicts. Richard had to
obtain blood transfusions, replacing his entire heroin-laced blood
supply, in order to get a visa to enter the United States.
   The ""rock stars'' are also totally artificial media creations.
Their public image, as well as their music, is fabricated from behind
the scenes by controllers. For example, when the Beatles first arrived
in the United States in 1964, they were mobbed at the airport by
hundreds of screaming teenage girls. The national press immediately
announced that ""Beatlemania'' had besieged the U.S.A.  But the girls
had all been transported from a girl's school in the Bronx, and paid
for their screaming performance by the Beatles' promoters.
   The money of the 1960s rock groups, which in somes cases mounted to
hundreds of millions of dollars, was also totally under the control of
mob-connected promoters. From 1963 to 1970, the Rolling Stones made
over $200 million, yet the group's members were all nearly bankrupt.
None of them had any idea of where their money went.
   Between 1963 and 1964 the Beatles and the Rolling Stones laid siege
to Western European and American culture.  This two-pronged invasion
from England was well-planned and well-timed.  America had just
suffered the shock of the assassination of President John Kennedy,
while in the streets the mass-based civil rights movement had just
held a Washington, D.C. rally, led by Martin Luther King, of 500,000
people. The rock counterculture would be used as a weapon to destroy
such political movements.
   Later in 1968 and 1969, years which saw a mass strike of students
and workers in the United States and Europe, huge, open-air rock
concerts were used to head off the growing discontent of the
population. The rock concerts were devised as a means for mass
recruitment to the drug-saturated, free-sex counterculture. For the
millions who came to these concerts, thousands of tablets of the
hallucinogenic drug, LSD, were made freely avaliable. These drugs were
secretly placed in drinks such as Coca-Cola, turning thousands of
unsuspecting victims into raving psychotics. Many committed suicide.
   Less than a half century ago, our young children studied violin and
piano, learning about the great classical composers such as Bach,
Mozart, and Beethoven. As will be shown, the same record companies who
today promote Satanic ""heavy-metal'' rock have run covert operations
to destroy the musical heritage of these great classical composers.
    For the past thirty years, Western society has been under the gun
of a deliberate plan of cultural warfare, with the purpose of
eliminating Judeo-Christian civilization as we know it. These plans
must not succeed.  So that the reader can better combat this evil,
we'll go back nearly thirty years, when those four innocent lads from
Liverpool, England, the Beatles, were just starting out.


Creating the Beatles

   The Beatles first began performing in the late 1950s in jazz clubs
in England and West Germany. These clubs, always located in the
seediest part of the cities, served as a marketplace for prostitution
and the circulation of drugs. Beatle biographer Philip Norman writes:
""Their only regular engagement was a strip club. The club owner paid
them ten shillings each to strum their guitars while a stripper named
Janice grimly shed her clothes before an audience of sailors, guilty
businessmen and habitues with raincoat- covered laps.''
   The Beatles got their first big break in Germany, in August 1960,
when they obtained a booking at a jazz club in Hamburg's notorious
Reeperbahn district. Describing the area Norman writes it had,
""red-lit windows containing whores in every type of fancy dress, all
ages from nymphet to granny...Everything was free.  Everything was
easy. The sex was easy... Here it came after you.''
   Far from the picture of innocence, the Beatles, even in their first
performances, were always high on a drug called Preludin, ""John
(Lennon), would be foaming at the mouth, he'd have so many pills
inside him...John, began to go berserk on stage, prancing and
groveling...The fact that the audience could not understand a word he
said, provoked John into cries of `Sieg Heil!' and `Fucking Nazis' to
which the audience invariably responded by laughing and clapping.''
   Off the stage, the Beatles were just as evil. Norman continues,
""while in Hamburg, John, each Sunday would stand on the balcony,
taunting the churchgoers as they walked to St.  Joseph's. He attached
a water-filled contraceptive to an effigy of Jesus and hung it out for
the churchgoers to see.  Once he urinated on the heads of three
nuns.''
   While in Hamburg, in June of 1962 the Beatles received a telegram
from their manager, a homosexual named Brian Epstein, who was back in
England.  ""Congratulations,'' Epstein's message read. ""EMI requests a
recording session.'' EMI was one of Europe's largest record producers,
and their role in promoting the Beatles would be key in the future.
   Under the the strict guidance of EMI's recording director George
Martin, and Brian Epstein, the Beatles were scrubbed, washed, and
their hair styled into the Beatles cut. EMI's Martin created the
Beatles in his recording studio.
   Martin was a trained classical musician, and had studied the oboe
and piano at the London School of Music.  The Beatles could neither
read music nor play any instrument other than guitar.  For Martin, the
Beatles musicianship was a bad joke. On their first hit record, ""Love
Me Do,'' Martin replaced Ringo on the drums with a studio musician.
Martin said Ringo, ""couldn't do a [drum] roll to save his life.''
>From then on, Martin would take the simple little tunes the Beatles
would come to him with, and turn them into hit records.


Lockwood and EMI

    EMI, led by aristocrat Sir Joseph Lockwood, stands for Electrical
and Mechanical Instruments, and is one of Britain's largest producers
of military electronics. Martin was director of EMI's subsidiary,
Parlophone. By the mid-sixties EMI, now called Thorn EMI, created a
music divison which had grown to 74,321 employees and had annual sales
of $3.19 billion.
    EMI was also a key member of Britain's military intelligence
establishment.
   After the war, in 1945, EMI's European production head Walter Legge
virtually took over control of classical music recordings, signing up
dozens of starving German classical musicians and singers to EMI
contracts.  Musicians who sought to preserve the performance tradition
of Beethoven and Brahms, were relegated to obscurity while ""ex-Nazi''
Party members were promoted. Legge signed and recorded Nazi member,
the late Herbert Von Karajan, promoting him to superstar status, while
great conductors such as Wilhelm Furtwangler were ignored.
   From the beginning, EMI created the myth of the Beatles' great
popularity.  In August of 1963, at their first major television
appearance at the London Palladium, thousands of their fans supposedly
rioted. The next day every mass-circulation newspaper in Great Britain
carried a front page picture and story stating, ""Police fought to hold
back 1,000 squealing teenagers.''  Yet, the picture displayed in each
newspaper was cropped so closely that only three or four of the
""squealing teenagers'' could be seen. The story was a fraud. According
to a photographer on the scene, ""There were no riots. I was there. We
saw eight girls, even less than eight.''
   In February 1964, the Beatles myth hit the United States, complete
with the orchestrated riots at Kennedy Airport, previously mentioned.
To launch their first tour, the media created one of the largest mass
audiences in history. For an unprecedented two Sundays in a row, on
the <Ed Sullivan Show>, over 75 million Americans watched the Beatles
shake their heads and sway their b

-=- 01.Introduction
------------------------------------------------------

Beyond the hype, behind the glamour, underneath the sea of buzzwords,
icons and flames a new subculture is spreading in this petri dish known as
the Internet. Here science and art - media and mind - combine in a cyborg
frenzy to create this replicant cousin to cyberpunk and hacking. It is a
subculture with no name, few labels, but thousands of common attractors,
which link together before our eyes like digital DNA to create, in the 
helix of the autologue, a new frontier for participants in these wide 
virtual spaces to explore.

Any document that attempts to cover an emerging culture is doomed to be
incomplete. Even more so if the culture has no overt identity (at least
none outside virtual space). But the other side of that coin presents us
with the oportunity to document the ebb and flow, the moments of growth
and defeat, the development of this young culture.

Although young, there is rich history and varied philosophies for this
group to draw on. From cyberpunk, the quest for access to information and
a vision of the future (the cyber) has been exorcised from the
distopic and 'punk'ish views of the monster the media has made of
cyberpunk. From the Hacker ethic, we get the rally cry that ""infomation
wants to be free."" From the workings of the Internet, we see the desire
for universal access and the pursuit of Jeffersonian Democracy (kapor)
that is manifested itself partially through the anarchy inherent in the
system and partially through the efforts of many net.users.

This document, although significantly different, attempts to pick up where
the FutureCulture FAQ (by andy hawks) left off. It should act as a
starting point for those new to the net, as one avenue to reach a level
of net.literacy, and as a handy reference point for those already
comfortable in this pocket of the net.

It is a road map to the interesting viewpoints, hot dog stands, museums, 
flora and fauna that dots this constantly changing landscape of virtual
space. Explore these sites. Dig in the cyborganic gardens. Report back 
your findings, so that others may follow. And they will.

[Cyberpoet]   Cyber-, having to do with information flow, human and
computer use/combinations, computer mediated communication. -Poet, one who
makes art with words, an artist, a renaissance trait. A cyberpoet is one
who strives to be artful in their use of virtual space. Someone who makes
frequent trips to the edge of technology/culture/society and then reports
back to anyone who will listen. The avant-guard of virtual culture.
Someone who, like a renaissance man, has their eye on the future and their
nose in its knowledge, technologies and politics.

---------------------------

Virtual Culture -- >>From A to Z

ADSL (Asynchronous Digital Subscriber Loop) - The transmission method
likely to be used to send movies, tv shows and sports - at the viewers
request - over existing telephone lines right to your television. Look for
this to be available and affordable in the next two years. This is the
main contender to ISDN, the winner will provide the link between 50
channels and 500 channels, 50,000 channels or (hopefully) more.

Agrippa: A Book of the Dead - A collaboration between author William
Gibson, publisher Kevin Begos Jr., and artist Dennis Ashbaugh. This
art-work contains engravings by Ashbaugh which appear or disappear in
light and an on-disk semi-autobiographical poem by William Gibson  which
is unreadable after having been read once.  Agrippa is notable because in
many respects it blurs the lines concerning what art is, and adds fuel to
the fire on issues of property rights and intellectual property.  A
highlight of 1992 was the release of Gibson's poem on to the net.

Artificial Life - man-made systems that exhibit characteristics associated
with the concept of ""life"".

Artificial Reality - similar to virtual reality, but more interactive,
with the participant being part of, not just experiencing, the artificial
environment.

Barlow, John Perry - A drummer for the Grateful Dead and co-founder of the
EFF. Now a net.denizen who speaks often on virtual culture and cyberspace
sociology and technology.

BBSes - electronic Bulletin Board Systems.  Begun in the late 70's, a form
of virtual community existing in cyberspace where participants (usually
using aliases) may send and receive public and private messages to each
other on any topic imaginable, transfer software (copyrighted and/or
public domain), play on-line games, etc.  There is the ""over-ground"" BBS
world where aliases are less common and illegal activities are avoided in
discussion, and the computer underground where illegal activities and
discussions are very common, members use aliases, and illegal information
and/or software is exchanged.

Boxing - A variety of electronic devices used to aid in phreaking. The
original was the blue box, used from the mid 60's to the mid 80's, which
allowed long distance phone calls to be made for free. A variety of other
similar instruments accomplishing different tasks have been developed,
some purely comical, some quite practical.

Chaos - Chaos is a state that garners a lot of respect in cyberculture, to
the point of being a techno-pagan religion. Many people are self-described
Chaoticians.

Chaos Theory - A field of science revolving around simplistic equations
involving a large number of variables. Gave rise to fractals, a form of
cyberdelic art. For further info on the subject, James Gleick's ""Chaos:
Making a New Science"" is suggested.

C0dez Doodz - Essentially a phreaker's version of pirates. People who seek
out telco codes to be used to gain long distance (ld) telephone calls
without paying for them. Scourge of the computer underground.

Communitek - an informational technology that provides the potential for a
community to develop in cyberspace. For example, within the net, IRC and
elists are two communiteks.

Computer Underground - ""A group organized in secrecy, hidden behind
aliases, to promote the free exchange of information regarding anything
and everything including, but not limited to: computers, telephones,
radios, chemicals, and ideas."" (Thanx to The Butler for this definition)
The mainstay of communication for the computer underground is cyberspace,
more specifically BBSes. The computer underground is composed of hackers,
phreakers, pirates, anarchists, and other cyberpunks.

Cyber- - A prefix taken from cybernetics generally used in popular culture
to mean anything that is technologically oriented.

Cyberculture - Often used in the media to denote aspects of ""life as a
cyberpunk."" Yet if we are to follow strict meaning, cyberculture is more
accurately defined as an information-based culture.

Cyberdeck - Term originated by William Gibson to refer to a computer used
by deck cowboys that can connect to the matrix.

Cyberdelic - ""Cyber-art"".  Examples include fractals, computer-generated
pictures and/or music, virtual worlds, etc. (sidebar - fractal pict)

Cybernetics - The study of communication systems in living organisms and
machines, the mathematical analysis of the flow of information.

Cyberpunk - Begun as a literary movement in the 80's, an off-shoot of
normal science fiction. Unique in that it generally occurs in the present
or not so distant future, the characters are often considered ""punks""
(social deviants) and technology, (the cyber aspect), is prominent.
""Neuromancer"" by William Gibson, published in 1984, is considered by most
to be the ""bible"" of cyberpunk.  Another prominent author is Bruce
Sterling, editor of another worthy cyberpunk collection, ""Mirrorshades"".
Other examples of cyberpunk include Max Headroom (TV show) and BladeRunner
(movie). Cyberpunk is special in that it has evolved from a purely
literary movement to a realistic subculture. Many ""techno-punks"" (i.e.,
hackers) are considered cyberpunks. Other contributing factors to the
cyberpunk subculture include:  virtual reality, hallucinogenic and
nootropic drugs, and industrial and punk music. For an in-depth, detailed
look at cyberpunk fiction and cyberpunk culture, ""Storming the Reality
Studio,"" ed. by Larry McCaffery is suggested.

Cyberspace - ""The electronic frontier."" A completely virtual environment:
the sum of all BBSes, computer networks, and other virtual communities.
Unique in that it is constantly being changed, exists only virtually, can
be practically infinite in ""size"", communication occurs instantaneously
world-wide - physical location is completely irrelevant most of the time.
Some include video and telephone transmissions as part of cyberspace.

Cypherpunks - net.folks who have evolved from hacking to encryption and
concern with creating multiple anonymous identities.

Deck Cowboys - Futuristic, some say fantasy, version of a computer hacker
or a modern-day cyberpunk.

Electronic Frontier Foundation - (EFF). Organization founded by Mitch
Kapor (of Lotus fame) and John Perry Barlow (writer and Grateful Dead
songwriter) to establish laws for cyberspace and apply the constitution to
virtual communities. The EFF has recently morphed into a strong lobbying
force in Washington D.C..

Elist (email-lists) - An electronic discussion group that anyone with an
email address can subscribe to. Email addresses for the elist members are
stored on a single computer. When you send email to that machine, it will
automatically bounce your letter to every other subscriber. Thousands of
these elists, covering almost every topic, exist on the Internet for your
reading pleasure and more are materializing weekly.

Ezine - An net version of the small press magazine (known as a zine)
culture. Usually ezines exist only on the net, but more and more
paper-zines are distributing an electronic version as well. (sidebar, some
zines to watch for)

F2F - face to face meeting (also FTF)

Flame - Disagreement (hell, full fledged war sometimes) occurring in
cyberspace. Common on Usenet.

Fleshmeet - a F2F meeting. Often a party of some sort where people who
have met previously on the net get together.

Fractals - Images created using chaos theory. A mish-mash of colors
presented in a pattern that repeats itself many times over.  A popular
type of fractal image is one created using the ""Mandlebrot set"".  Fractals
are considered cyberdelic art.

Gibson, William - Considered by most to be the ""father"" of cyberpunk,
along with Bruce Sterling. His works include the infamous ""Neuromancer"",
""Count Zero"", ""Mona Lisa Overdrive"" (these 3 works are known as the sprawl
series), ""The Difference Engine"" with which he was co-author with Bruce
Sterling, and ""Burning Chrome"" a collection of short stories.  A recent
work of his is a poem in ""Agrippa: A Book of the Dead"".  Gibson says he
will no longer be writing the ""classic""  cyberpunk novels he is famous
for.  His latest work is entitled ""Virtual Light"" is futuristic fiction
was released in August.

Global Village - Famous term coined by Marshall McLuhan, exemplified by
the net.

Gopher - A menu driven service useful for grep'ing info off the net. You
forgot your friend's email address, look here. Need to read the latest
issue of ""Voices from the net"" (An electronic text based zine or ezine),
look here. Searching for a file to read or software to download, use
Gopher. Over 1200 individual gopher sites exist and the number is growing
weekly.

Grep - search, or scan.

Grok - Word with roots in Shamanism that is akin to gnow. and implies a
thorough and complete holistic understanding. Popularized in Robert A.
Heinlein's _Stranger in a Strange Land_.

Hacker - 60's (1st) generation (orig. MIT):  one who tinkers with
software, electronics, computer hardware, etc.  80's (2nd) WarGames
generation:  one who enters computer systems without permission with
either malicious or non-malicious intent, to gain, alter, or destroy
information (labeled as crackers by the 60's generation).  90's (3rd)
generation:  often called cyberpunks, mostly non-malicious crackers
interested in information for the sake of information, and not hacking for
the sake of the hack - sometimes calling themselves ""information
liberators"", they have re-adopted more of the original hacker ethic of the
60's that mainly states ""all information should be free"", ""access to
computers should be unlimited and total"" and ""promote decentralization"".
This new, 3rd generation is commonly associated with the computer
underground, despite its mostly non-malicious intent.

Identity Hacking - The use of pseudo-anonymity or false accounts to
put ones self off as another person on the Internet. Not nice.

Infonomics - The idea of an economy based on information, which obviously
holds many different properties from our current state of the world.

Internet - A large and very popular world-wide computer network begun by
the Department of Defense in the 60's that connects educational
institutions, corporations, organizations, and military and government
installations around the globe. Some organizations exist that offer
Internet access to the general public for an hourly,monthly or yearly fee.
Suggested are places like the WELL, MindVox, Nyx (which is free of cost),
Netcom, etc.  Many Internet users partake in reading and contributing to
Usenet, playing MUDs, FTPing text files and programs free of charge at the
various FTP sites, and 'telnet'ing to other Internet sites. Because of its
accessibility at a relatively low cost, size (the largest computer network
in the world), connectivity, and infinite amounts of information, many
network users prefer the Internet to such services as CompuServe (often
called Compu$erve on the Internet) or Prodigy (which is more restricting
in its content). The Internet has something to offer for everyone. There
are many helpful books published about how to use the Internet, some are
available right on-line.  Once you gain access to the Internet, it is
suggested that you read the 'news.announce.newusers' and
'news.newusers.questions' and 'news.answers' newsgroups on Usenet.

IRC - Internet Relay Chat. Realtime communication forums between Internet
users all over the world.

ISDN - Integrated Services Digital Network.  A communitek hopefully coming
soon to a house near you, basically it will greatly expand the potential
for information coming into your house, such as having 700 cable TV
channels, interactive realtime video-phones, and far off in the future
possible even realtime networked interactive 3d virtual reality.

Kapor, Mitch - One of EFF's founders (along with John Perry Barlow). He
started the Lotus software company and built it into one of the top 5
software companies in the world, then left to start the EFF. In addition
to working at the top of EFF ladder, he frequently writes stories for
magazines and newspapers, interviews on the TV and is often called to
testify before congressional hearings.

Knowbot - provides a uniform user interface to heterogeneous remote
information services. A predecesor to the Intelligent Agent.

Legion of Doom - (LoD). A legendary group of hackers from the computer
underground. When they disbanded, some members went on to form a computer
security firm (ComSec), Loyd Blankenship wrote GURPS Cyberpunk for Steve
Jackson Games and some ended up in jail from Operation Sundevil.

Matrix - Term coined by William Gibson that refers to the consensual
hallucination of cyberspace.

Meme - An ""agent of communicative resonance,"" or more simply, ""an
information virus.""  Memetics is the study and theories behind the root
structures of information itself.

MindVox - A virtual community in cyberspace, also a BBS connected to the
Internet.  A nexus of the computer underground and cyberpunk and virtual
reality began by Phantom Access Technologies, former members of the Legion
of Doom. See also the WELL.

Mirrorshades - A very important collection of cyberpunk fiction by various
authors, most of whom are labeled as the mirrorshades group. This book is
edited by Bruce Sterling and should be available in most bookstores.

Mirrorshades Group - Original collection of cyberpunk authors which
includes William Gibson, Bruce Sterling, Tom Maddox, Lewis Shiner, John
Shirley, SF Eye magazine editor Steve Brown, Rudy Rucker, Pat Cadigan, and
others.

Mondo 2000 - Very popular cyberpunk and new edge magazine. Recently
challenged by a new magazine, WIRED.

MUD - Multi-User Domain, Multi-User Dungeon, or Multi-User Dimension. MUDs
are multi-user role-playing-games of sorts that exist on the Internet for
entertainment purposes. MUDs are essentially text-based virtual worlds
which players (participants) may explore, change, or add on to. In most
cases, the MUD is actually a ""game"" with scores, player attributes,
levels, etc., but some MUDs are with more social goals in mind. MUDs tend
to be based around different science fiction genres such as fantasy,
space, or even cyberpunk.

only by a microscope, that
can be used in areas such as medicine and health, art, and other
technologies.

Net - A computer network. Often used to mean the Internet when referred to
as ""the net"".

Netrip - Many similarities exist in some people's minds between
psychedelic drugs and the net, and a netrip is the state of literally
getting ""high"" off the net, accompanied by distortions in space and time,
a gnowledge of the net itself, an intense desire to communicate your
subconscious to the rest of the net, etc.

New Edge - Fringe culture and fringe science, mostly techno-oriented, and
very popular in Southern California. Mondo 2000 is a magazine devoted to
the new edge.

Nexus - The dictionary defines a ""nexus"" as a ""a connection, tie, or link
between individuals of a group, members of a series, etc."" When applied to
virtual cultures and the networked humans which comprise them, a NEXUS is
basically a domicile/workspace/cultural-center formed in real-life by
people who have met and established relationships over the Net.  They
purchase and secure group Internet access, and thus control their own
node, living in close proximity, since creativity blossoms in people when
surrounded with creativity; since similar approaches to work and life can
re-inforce each other.  We have seen this happen on the Net; the NEXUS
community intends to manifest it in reality, to integrate it into our
lifestyle.

Nootropics - A new science revolving around drugs used to increase
intelligence, aid in memory, enhance brain activity, etc. Touted as a fad
by some, others claim that use of nootropics actually work.  See also
SmartDrinks.

Operation Sundevil - Secret Service operation begun in 1990 intended to
destroy the computer underground by confiscating BBSes and detaining
hackers.

Paste Bomb - Sometimes a litteral core dump. Via the Mac's Cut and Paste
capability, take random bits of data from one's hard drive and paste it
into an online conversation, email, mud, whatever.  Eris Lives. Sci-fi
author Bruce Sterling is a notorious paste bomber. Get in the habit

Phrack - An important magazine existing only in cyberspace, of interest to
the computer underground. It's founder, Craig Neidorf, now works for the
Electronic Frontier Foundation.

Phreaker - Hacking the phone system. Usually meaning to get phone calls
for free, whether by boxing or calling card fraud. Individual phreakers
are called phreaks.

Pirate - One who copies software illegally. Commonly associated with the
computer underground.  Although commonplace, pirates are looked down upon
as with codez d00dz . (sidebar SPA and the big corporation pirates)

Post-industrial - The state of the world, including megacorp zaibatsus, an
evolving infonomics, etc.

Post-modern - Literary, artistic, cultural, and philosophical movement
revolving around the post-industrial world in which we live, and the
unique aspects of the trends of modern society.

Raves - A 'dying' subculture revolving around all-night dance parties.
Typically, the parties are generally illegal and thus a complex process is
involved to find out where they are located. Rave music is generally
techno or house , the parties usually include 1 or more DJs. Also present
in many cases are ""chill out rooms"" which feature more ambient music.
Lasers, blaring music, cyberdelic images, SmartDrinks and drugs most often
MDMA {X, XTC, Ecstasy, E}, LSD {acid}, ketamine, or nootropics) are all
general contributors to the rave experience.  Raves are usually held in
warehouses, and last until the next morning. Another large part of rave
culture is the flyers - used to find out where your next  party will be.
Raves are meant to be very happy events, everyone ideally should be open
and free, laying aggressions and inhibitions aside for the night. Some
have likened the rave experience to ""a weekly roving techno-woodstock for
the 90's.""  Rave fashion includes over-sized baggy t-shirts and pants,
hooded sweat-shirts, ski caps, and usually bright colors, as well as
accessories such as whistles, Cat In The Hat hats, ""doctor"" masks,
VapoRub, etc. Many factors have led to an often heard questions these
days, ""where have all the ravers gone?"" (one answer is... they've gone Retro)

RTFM - Read The Fucking Manual. An abbreviation used when clueless 
questions are asked about subjects that are answered in the manual or FAQ.

Shaman - An overused word that in ancient and modern cultures implies one
who is a wise medicine man or healer, with a keen understanding of the
ways of things. Used increasingly in modern culture, especially in
conjunction with techno-paganism.

Slipstream - Term used to denote cyberpunk fiction, particularly pre-1984
fictional works that have been influential to the mirrorshades group or
that closely resemble cyberpunk, but are sometimes outside of the sf
genre. An example would be William S. Burroughs.

SmartDrugs - nootropics.

SmartDrinks - Similar to SmartDrugs,

     3                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  I believe we are

     4    ready to begin this morning.  I think we had a very

     5    full day yesterday.  We heard a great deal, both from


     6    the Departments and from the Gulf War Veterans.

     7                This morning, we are going to have a

     8    briefing from the Institute of Medicine, the National


     9    Academy of Sciences.  They have had two studies

    10    ongoing.  One, the Committee to Review the Health

    11    Consequences of Service During the Persian Gulf War. 

    12    And then, the Committee on the DOD Persian Gulf


    13    Syndrome Comprehensive Clinical Evaluation Program.

    14                And I would like to ask the people who are

    15    going to present to come forward at this point.  Take


    16    their places at the table.

    17                Dr. Kelsey, will you be starting off?

    18                DR. KELSEY:  Yes.

    19                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Okay.  Please


    20    proceed.

    21                DR. KELSEY:  Thanks, Dr. Lashof.

    22                I first want to thank the Committee for


    23    inviting me and send greetings from John Bailar, who

    24    is the chairman of the committee, who couldn't be here

    25    today.


                                                                          5

     1                What I am going to do is very briefly give


     2    you an overview of the Institute of Medicine process,

     3    which is familiar to many of you.  And then, describe

     4    the workings of our committee, touching primarily on

     5    the points from our first report.


     6                As many of you know, the Institute of

     7    Medicine is a part of the National Research Council. 

     8    And the members who serve on these committees serve as


     9    volunteers.  It was established congressionally and

    10    operates as an independent body.

    11                Our committee was established by public

    12    law, a law passed in November of 1992, which was about


    13    the time the oil fires were a very large part of the

    14    Congressional mind.  The law requires the VA and the

    15    Department of Defense to enter into a joint agreement


    16    with medical follow-up agency, the Institute of

    17    Medicine, to fund a study to end in 1996.

    18                The funding level is $500,000.00 a year,

    19    as you can see, equally split between the two


    20    agencies.  The study really began with money arriving

    21    in October of 1993.  And the first meeting was held

    22    then, in January of 1994.


    23                We issued our first report on January 4th

    24    of 1995, with the final report due approximately some

    25    time around the summer of 1996.


                                                                          6

     1                We have an 18-member committee.  And we


     2    have -- I've got the members of the committee listed

     3    here, with John Bailar, as I mentioned, the chair. 

     4    The committee has met nine times.  And we are

     5    scheduled again to meet in September.


     6                We have members with various expertise,

     7    including epidemiology, toxicology, biostatistics,

     8    infectious disease and vaccination, reproductive


     9    health, psychiatry, respiratory illness, immunology --

    10    the areas, broadly speaking, needed to touch on the

    11    health consequences of service during the Persian Gulf

    12    -- in a very broad sense.


    13                We have obtained information through a

    14    wide variety of means, including presentations from

    15    members of the government.  Some of the members of the


    16    panel have presented information to us.

    17                We have also had an excellent staff that

    18    have made inquiries broadly, and looking also through

    19    the open literature, much of which has been found to


    20    be actually quite lacking.

    21                The public law that established the

    22    committee then, really had three direct points.  The


    23    first one was to assess the effectiveness of actions

    24    taken by the Secretaries of the Veterans

    25    Administration and the Department of Defense to


                                                                          7

     1    collect and maintain information useful in assessing


     2    these health consequences.

     3                That was specifically the first point. 

     4    The second one was to make recommendations on the

     5    means of improving collection and/or maintenance of


     6    this information, again aimed at the data base issue.

     7                And then finally, to make recommendations

     8    as to whether there was a sound scientific basis for


     9    an epidemiological study or studies for the follow-up

    10    of the veterans' health.  And we were also mandated to

    11    discuss or recommend the nature of such study or

    12    studies.


    13                So that, explicitly, is our mandate.  As

    14    I have mentioned, we released a report on January 4th,

    15    an interim report, so to speak, which was motivated by


    16    the committee's sense that there were some

    17    recommendations that we wanted to make prior to the

    18    end of the three years, primarily because we felt that

    19    there was some immediate recommendations that could be


    20    utilized by the VA and the Department of Defense in

    21    moving forward with some of these important and

    22    pressing issues.


    23                We really stress three areas, data and

    24    data bases, coordination, and study design needs. 

    25    Specifically then, in addressing what we recommended,


                                                                          8

     1    we talked a little bit about the registry, which you


     2    have heard quite a bit about.

     3                We stressed that this was a self-selected

     4    population.  That the population itself was not

     5    designed for research.  And so, while it should be


     6    reviewed and updated regularly to monitor sentinel

     7    events, which really was its chief purpose.  That is,

     8    to monitor for sentinel events.


     9                We also stressed that it would be useful,

    10    certainly, for following up the Persian Gulf Veterans,

    11    and definitely for future conflicts, to take a very

    12    strong look at the data systems and try very hard to


    13    link them.

    14                This currently is very difficult, as I am

    15    sure you are aware.  And it's instances like this that


    16    led us to believe that considerable effort might be

    17    made to make the data available in linkage systems.

    18                Again, we also recommended that the

    19    Department of Defense Unit Location Registry be


    20    completed with a high priority since, in fact, that

    21    could give us both denominator information as well as

    22    potential to look at exposure information.


    23                We also touched on coordination and

    24    recommended that funding be based on scientific merit

    25    for any studies that were deemed useful while the


                                                                          9

     1    committee was ongoing.


     2                We strongly urged that all activities

     3    undergo external peer review and that they be based on

     4    scientific merit.  This was something that we felt was

     5    very important.  And there were examples of how this


     6    had been lacking in the past.

     7                We also recommended that active

     8    coordination of the activities of various agencies be


     9    undertaken to reduce redundancy.  There was a

    10    considerable amount of duplication in efforts early

    11    on.  And we felt the need to stress that coordination

    12    was important in this endeavor.


    13                The third point then involved study design

    14    needs.  What we recommended was that we define really

    15    what is needed for research.  We recommended a


    16    population-based epidemiologic study using what we

    17    have deemed really data which will be, if it is not

    18    currently, available with the completion of some of

    19    the work of the Department of the Defense and the VA.


    20                We also stressed that information derived

    21    from cluster or outbreak investigation was minimally

    22    useful.  And while it was important in a sentinel


    23    sense, this was not the goal of future studies.

    24                The mortality study that the VA was

    25    conducting -- we also agree it should be extended to


                                                                         10

     1    observe any excess from chronic disease.


     2                We use the example of lead to illustrate

     3    that many of the possible events that have been tied

     4    to chronic disease have not been fully investigated. 

     5    And certainly, lead deserves a closer look in future


     6    studies.

     7                We also recommended that the various

     8    agencies continue their work looking for appropriate


     9    models to evaluate potential interactions in terms of

    10    compounds to which the troops were exposed.  That is,

    11    Deet, permethrin, insecticides, and vaccines,

    12    pyridostigmine as well.


    13                And then, we further recommended that

    14    leishmania tropica be a subject of intensive research

    15    as this had been a hypothesis for a considerable


    16    amount of disease and represented a very serious

    17    research challenge.  We felt that it was very

    18    appropriate to intensively study this particular

    19    problem.


    20                We also then addressed some of the

    21    putative outcomes associated with servicing the

    22    Persian Gulf War.  I list here for you some of the


    23    things that we have heard about from veterans and

    24    which we have considered as part of our list of

    25    putative outcomes associated with service.


                                                                         11

     1                And I won't read the list for you.  I only


     2    show it in an effort to let you know that the list is

     3    considerable and is something that we have wrestled

     4    with.  We also likewise have thought about a number of

     5    putative exposures.  And the committee has expertise


     6    in all these areas.

     7                And we looked very closely then at any

     8    associations between these putative exposures and the


     9    outcomes.  And again, I show you the list to

    10    illustrate the areas that we are looking at.

    11                Finally then, my last overhead really

    12    involves our future plans.  We continue to look at the


    13    evaluation of data collection and the ongoing

    14    research.  We are continuing, as I have indicated, to

    15    look closely at the health problems in general, not


    16    just the unexplained illness associated with the

    17    Persian Gulf service.

    18                Our committee is charged with a broad

    19    range of health consequences.  And we continue to look


    20    at them closely.  And finally, we are also continuing

    21    to look at potential exposures and outcomes for our

    22    research recommendations, as part of our mandate.


    23                Thank you.  I will be happy to address any

    24    questions that you have as well at any point.

    25                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Thank you very much,


                                                                         12

     1    Dr. Kelsey.


     2                I think we will proceed to hear the second

     3    annual report.  We'll hear from Dr. Burrow, and then

     4    open it up for questions from the panel for both

     5    reports.


     6                DR. BURROW:  Thank you.  I'm Gerard

     7    Burrow, the dean of the Yale University School of

     8    Medicine and chairman of the Institute of Medicine


     9    Committee on the DOD Persian Gulf Comprehensive

    10    Clinical Evaluation Program.

    11                The committee was formed in October of

    12    1994 at the request of Dr. Stephen Joseph, the


    13    Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs.

    14                In the brief time allotted, I'd like to

    15    address three topics:  a description of the charge to


    16    our committee since we have two IOM committees, a

    17    summary of the major findings included in our first

    18    report on CCEP which was released on December 2nd,

    19    1994, and a summary of the major findings included in


    20    our second report which we released to your Committee

    21    and to the general public yesterday.

    22                The charge to our committee was to


    23    evaluate the protocol for the Comprehensive Clinical

    24    Evaluation Program or CCEP for short, to comment on

    25    the interpretation and the results that have been


                                                                         13

     1    obtained so for, to make recommendations relevant to


     2    the conduct of the program in the future, and to make

     3    recommendations on the broader program of the DOD

     4    Persian Gulf health studies, if appropriate.

     5                The IOM committee was comprised of 12


     6    individuals with a distribution not unlike the other

     7    committee, with Dr. Kelley Brix as the study director. 

     8    We will have held four meetings and produced three


     9    reports by the end of the project on September 30th,

    10    1995.

    11                You have heard about the structure, as Dr.

    12    Kelsey has addressed, of the selection and procedures


    13    of that IOM committee.  Let me simply state that the

    14    goal is to make these IOM scientific reports

    15    independent, authoritative, and objective.


    16                The first report of this committee was

    17    released on December 2nd, 1994 based on the

    18    information on the CCEP that was available from the

    19    DOD in October of 1994.  And remember again that it


    20    started in June of 1994, so this was very early.

    21                The committee at that time concluded that

    22    the CCEP design represented a serious attempt by the


    23    DOD to evaluate and treat the health problems of

    24    military personnel who were on active duty in the

    25    Persian Gulf.


                                                                         14

     1                The committee suggested at that time that


     2    attention be paid to three issues:  the division of

     3    labor and other resources between the local medical

     4    treatment facilities and regional medical centers and

     5    between Phase I, the beginning phase, and Phase II,


     6    the referral phase, in the CCEP in light of the

     7    enormous large numbers of CCEP patients, and in the

     8    light of the apparent use of CCEP by patients to


     9    obtain timely, high-quality medical care which would

    10    otherwise not be as readily available.

    11                We thought there should be attention to

    12    the relationship between the clinical care aspects of


    13    CCEP for which it was designed and research functions

    14    and commented on the prominence of stress and

    15    psychiatric disorders as diagnosis and/or as


    16    contributing factors in the CCEP findings.

    17                The purpose of the second report is to

    18    comment upon an unpublished confidential draft DOD

    19    report entitled ""Comprehensive Clinical Evaluation


    20    Program For Gulf War Veterans Report on 10,020

    21    Participants.""

    22                That report was dated June 7th, 1995.  I


    23    believe you have the report that was issued on August

    24    1st which was a revised report.  Although the DOD had

    25    not seen the IOM's second report, the final DOD report


                                                                         15

     1    which was released on August 1st contained several


     2    revisions compared to the June 7th draft.

     3                These revisions in the final DOD report

     4    address some of the concerns expressed in our second

     5    report, even though the IOM committee had no


     6    opportunity to review the August 1st report before it

     7    was published.  So that -- you will see some

     8    dissynchrony.


     9                The IOM committee reviewed several

    10    documents relating to illnesses among Persian Gulf

    11    Veterans.  These were authored by the Department of

    12    Defense and others.


    13                I would emphasize that the committee has

    14    not performed its own independent research, nor

    15    examined individual patients.


    16                Second, the committee's second report was

    17    based on the following:  review of two published and

    18    one unpublished report by the Department of Defense

    19    which described the results of the program, three IOM


    20    committee meetings that included presentations by DOD

    21    CCEP physicians, review of several reports which are

    22    listed in the appendix of our second report, and


    23    attendance by the Institute of Medicine staff at a

    24    number of meetings organized by the DOD and Department

    25    of Veterans Affairs.


                                                                         16

     1                The CCEP has developed -- has been


     2    developed as a thorough, systematic approach to the

     3    diagnosis of a wide spectrum of diseases.  DOD has

     4    made a conscientious effort to build consistency and

     5    quality assurance into the CCEP at the many military


     6    medical facilities across the country.

     7                The protocol has resulted in specific

     8    medical diagnosis or diagnoses for most patients.  The


     9    signs and symptoms of many patients could be explained

    10    by well-recognized diseases that are readily

    11    diagnosable and treatable.

    12                The committee concludes that this is a


    13    more likely interpretation -- that a high prevalence -

    14    - than the interpretation that a high prevalence of

    15    CCE patients are suffering from a unique previously


    16    unknown mystery disease that has a very large number

    17    of supposedly pathognomonic symptoms.

    18                 A major DOD conclusion in their report of

    19    June 7th, quote:


    20                ""To date, the CCEP has identified

    21          no clinical evidence for a unique or new

    22          illness or syndrome among Persian Gulf


    23          Veterans.""

    24                The committee -- our committee urged

    25    caution or more justification for this statement.  As


                                                                         17

     1    members of the committee are aware, it is always


     2    harder in epidemiology to prove that a new disease

     3    does not exist than to prove that it does exist.

     4                If a new or unique illness were either

     5    mild or only affected a small proportion of veterans


     6    at risk, the illness might go undetected even in a

     7    large case series.

     8                On the other hand, if indeed there were a


     9    new, unique Persian Gulf-related illness that could

    10    cause serious disability in a high proportion of

    11    veterans at risk, it would probably be detectable in

    12    a population of 10,020 patients.  This pattern has not


    13    been detected.

    14                Dr. Stephen Josephs and other DOD

    15    physicians have discussed the likelihood that at least


    16    a few CCE patients had developed illnesses that are

    17    directly related to the Persian Gulf service.

    18                It is also likely that some CCE patients

    19    had developed illnesses that are coincidental and


    20    therefore unrelated to their Persian Gulf illness. 

    21    And in some cases, they had predated their Persian

    22    Gulf service.  These possibilities should have been


    23    mentioned in the DOD report.

    24                In summary, our overall conclusions were

    25    that the program was designed primarily as a clinical


                                                                         18

     1    program to evaluate and treat the health problems of


     2    individuals who have served their country during the

     3    Persian Gulf conflict.

     4                As a secondary goal, the DOD has published

     5    a series of reports which describe and interpret the


     6    symptoms and diagnoses of the entire group of CCE

     7    patients.

     8                Overall, our committee is impressed with


     9    the quality of the design and the efficiency of the

    10    implementation of the clinical protocol.  The

    11    committee has been particularly impressed with the

    12    dedication and commitment of the DOD physicians who


    13    actually care for the Persian Gulf Veterans.

    14                The committee is also impressed by the

    15    considerable devotion of resources to this program and


    16    the remarkable amount of work that has been

    17    accomplished in just now, a little over a year.

    18                Thank you again for the opportunity to

    19    address the committee.  And I would also be delighted


    20    to try and answer any questions that you might have.

    21                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Thank you very much,

    22    Dr. Burrow.


    23                The panel is now open for questions.  And

    24    we can move around our group and --

    25                Andrea, any questions?


                                                                         19

     1                (No response.)


     2                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Rolando, any

     3    questions?

     4                (No response.)

     5                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Elaine?


     6                DR. LARSON:  Several quick questions.

     7                First of all for Dr. Kelsey, we heard

     8    testimony yesterday about a couple of things I'd like


     9    to ask you about.  First of all, we heard testimony

    10    that there were long months of waiting for

    11    examinations.  And I am wondering if the committee is

    12    going to address anything about timeliness of data


    13    collection because that has not only clinical

    14    implications, but certainly research implications.

    15                And one related question about what we


    16    heard yesterday.  That is, concern about if there is

    17    a Persian Gulf-related syndrome or illness that is

    18    characterized by a multiplicity of signs and symptoms. 

    19    And I understand from yesterday that the data


    20    collection is cut off after six symptoms.  Is that

    21    correct?

    22                DR. KELSEY:  You know, Dr. Burrows may be


    23    a more appropriate person for the question.  Certainly

    24    the issue of timeliness is critical in a lot of ways.

    25                The committee certainly considered that


                                                                         20

     1    issue in trying to determine how to use the registry


     2    information because it bears on interpretation of that

     3    data.  And I think that's part of our recommendation

     4    that the data be treated in a certain fashion.  With

     5    respect to --


     6                DR. BURROW:  The question of timeliness

     7    was why we made that comment after the first meeting. 

     8    I mean, they were -- the process was simply being


     9    overwhelmed by individuals coming in and attempting to

    10    see them.  And everyone was getting a very complete

    11    protocol.  And that was altered in that they have

    12    processed a very large number of patients.


    13                The number of both symptoms and diagnoses

    14    are cut off after seven, I think.  If one looks at

    15    these, there are a multitude of diagnoses, but they


    16    vary so that there is a wide variety and --

    17                DR. LARSON:  Two other questions.  What

    18    has been the response of the DOD to your

    19    recommendations from the report in December of 1994? 


    20    It's been seven and a half months.

    21                DR. BURROW:  They have been responsive,

    22    have changed the direction in the way that the


    23    patients are being used.  In a more recent -- in the

    24    first draft that we saw of the Defense Department

    25    report in June, that they had gone on at some length


                                                                         21

     1    about environmental threat.


     2                We question whether that was -- should be

     3    in there.  And that has been modified in the new

     4    report.  So that -- in fact, I think that they have

     5    been responsive to the committee.


     6                DR. LARSON:  And last question, what's the

     7    interface between your two committees?  How do you

     8    interact and communicate?


     9                DR. BURROW:  The two people on either side

    10    of me are the probably major interactors.

    11                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Phil?

    12                DR. LANDRIGAN:  Yes.  Good morning.  I'd


    13    like to -- one of the recommendations that was made in

    14    the report ""Health Consequences of Service"" -- is that

    15    -- is that yours, Karl?


    16                -- was a report that the Vice President

    17    should chair a committee.  I guess this committee is

    18    an approximation of that.  And that one of our tasks

    19    should be to devise a plan to link data systems on


    20    health outcomes with standardized forms and an

    21    organized system of records.

    22                One of the things that we heard repeatedly


    23    yesterday were tales of lost records, records that

    24    didn't get from the DOD system to the VA, records that

    25    were lost in transfer from one hospital to another. 


                                                                         22

     1    Basically a system that seems to be still operating


     2    largely on paper and not in electronic form.

     3                And I wondered if you -- this

     4    recommendation is good, but it's also rather brief --

     5    if you had any plans to further elaborate upon that


     6    recommendation and spell out in more detail your

     7    thoughts.

     8                DR. KELSEY:  Certainly.  I think you've


     9    hit upon a -- what we view as a very important

    10    recommendation.  It's something that's crucial to the

    11    endeavor we're all about.

    12                The word ""denominator"" has come up I know


    13    in your meeting and obviously, if you are interested

    14    in following up any of the health consequences of

    15    anything like this, the absence of a denominator is a


    16    big problem.

    17                Our view is that in fact the linking of

    18    the data systems between the Department of Defense and

    19    the VA is critical in follow up of any soldiers


    20    anywhere.  And in our view that is very much lacking. 

    21    It obviously also is going to take major effort to

    22    link these systems.


    23                But the committee I think in its first

    24    report was very much trying to say -- given the amount

    25    of effort and the amount of money that has been spent


                                                                         23

     1    to date on this problem, it might be best to think


     2    about prevention.

     3                And the best way we know of to prevent

     4    this type of thing is to get systems in place where

     5    denominators are a little more forthcoming.


     6                And obviously we feel data systems and

     7    data bases exist to computerize this and to make the -

     8    - not only the record, but potentially, then,


     9    caregiving improved by swift and easy flow of

    10    information.

    11                So the Vice President's name was there, I

    12    think, because of the importance we felt due to this


    13    problem.  And I think we'll revisit that.  I have no

    14    doubt that it is still an important problem.

    15                DR. LANDRIGAN:  Right.  It would seem to


    16    me that it has implications for the future too.  The -

    17    - I mean, the world is unfortunately -- remains an

    18    unsettled place.

    19                And there are likely to be further


    20    deployments of American troops overseas to

    21    environments that are less than friendly.  And these

    22    problems in one form or another are going to recur I


    23    am afraid in the years ahead.  And it would be nice to

    24    have the system in place beforehand the next time.

    25                DR. KELSEY:  I mean, I think your point is


                                                                         24

     1    a very good one.  And I'm glad you've raised it.  And


     2    I think you've hit upon something the committee feels

     3    very strongly about.

     4                DR. LANDRIGAN:  One more question.  I --

     5    this may go beyond the purview of your committee.  And


     6    if it is, you'll tell me.  But we heard yesterday an

     7    interesting point that I had not been previously been

     8    aware of.


     9                And that is that the Veterans

    10    Administration doesn't compensate veterans for

    11    service-related disease if the disease first becomes

    12    manifest more than two years -- I don't know if it's


    13    more than two years after discharge from the service,

    14    or more than two years after the exposure has taken

    15    place.


    16                But in either event, it's an approach that

    17    basically cuts off from consideration within the

    18    workers comp. -- the VA compensation system -- any

    19    disease with long latency.


    20                This is an approach, of course, that some

    21    state workers compensation systems used to have.  And

    22    most of them dropped it in the 1950's, recognizing


    23    that diseases like the diseases caused by asbestos can

    24    develop as long as decades after the exposure takes

    25    place.


                                                                         25

     1                And I wondered if you folks had given any


     2    consideration -- if either of the two committees had

     3    given any consideration to that point.

     4                DR. BURROW:  Dr. Brix just informed me

     5    that we believe it's two years after leaving the Gulf


     6    for individuals with unexplained illness.  I mean --

     7    but our committee didn't really deal with that at all.

     8                DR. KELSEY:  And we are really not dealing


     9    with compensation issues, although it's an interesting

    10    point.

    11                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Marguerite?

    12                DR. KNOX:  Was there any data related to


    13    that about identifiable diseases that are diagnosed

    14    after the two-year periods?  Do you know anything

    15    about that, patients who have diagnosable diseases


    16    after the two years?

    17                DR. BURROW:  I have no information on it.

    18                DR. KNOX:  I wondered if there was --

    19    after your recommendation to DOD --


    20                DR. BURROW:  I'm sorry.  Dr. Brix just

    21    said that we do not think there is any limit on that. 

    22    It was just for the unidentified diseases.  I mean


    23    that is our understanding.  In other words, if you

    24    have a specific label, then that time limit doesn't

    25    hold.


                                                                         26

     1                DR. KNOX:  Still, I think veterans are


     2    having to prove that the disease was related.  And

     3    without any patterning and aggregating of certain

     4    health diseases, that's very difficult to prove.

     5                So I hope there will be some long-term


     6    studies looking at patients who have been diagnosed

     7    with neoplasias, either benign or malignant, that have

     8    occurred in Gulf War Veterans.  And I don't think that


     9    we've really looked at that very well.

    10                DR. BURROW:  I feel like a puppet.

    11                DR. KNOX:  Sorry.

    12                DR. BURROW:  Both the DOD and the Veterans


    13    Administration have information on that.

    14                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  I have no problem

    15    with Kelley Brix and Diane Mundt also contributing and


    16    speaking and not having to puppet through.  We are

    17    informal.  And we certainly -- it's within our

    18    protocol to -- please, I welcome Kelley and Diane to

    19    freely speak for themselves.


    20                Yes?

    21                DR. BRIX:  Dr. Knox, you said you were

    22    interested in neoplastic activities in particular?  I


    23    believe that both the Department of Defense and the

    24    Department of Veterans Affairs have data on both --

    25    particularly this have malignant cancers.


                                                                         27

     1                And they have tables in their -- in the


     2    materials that they passed out in the August 1st

     3    report, as well as the DVA's most recent report has a

     4    list of all the known patients diagnosed with cancer. 

     5    And all the different types.


     6                DR. KNOX:  Could you tell me if the exam -

     7    - veterans who did not receive the recommended

     8    Comprehensive Clinical Evaluation -- I guess, could


     9    those veterans go back and have that comprehensive

    10    evaluation?  Those that did not receive it early on?

    11                DR. BURROW:  There are two kinds of

    12    veterans:  one, people who served in the Persian Gulf


    13    and are still on active service, and others who have

    14    been discharged.  If they have been discharged, it

    15    would be done through the Veterans Administration.


    16                DR. KNOX:  So it would be available, is

    17    your understanding?

    18                (No response.)

    19                DR. KNOX:  Could you tell me about the


    20    environmental toxin, the serum assays that maybe were

    21    recommended for that evaluation?

    22                (No response.)


    23                DR. KNOX:  Were there any?

    24                (No response.)

    25                DR. KNOX:  For instance, lead poisoning or


                                                                         28

     1    depleted uranium for those patients that complained of


     2    that?

     3                DR. KELSEY:  Yes.  We -- the issue of lead

     4    and depleted uranium were both addressed in our first

     5    report.  And we're -- we recommended that, I think, a


     6    little bit more work be done around those issues.

     7                The lead levels that were initially drawn

     8    clearly indicated that there needed to be some follow-


     9    up, certainly of some individuals.  And that was one

    10    of our recommendations.

    11                In addition, the depleted uranium issue

    12    also left a small cohort, but albeit a defined cohort


    13    that could be followed.  And we recommended that as

    14    well.

    15                There is a serum bank -- that you referred


    16    to serum.  There is a serum bank.  And obviously, this

    17    can provide a resource for a lot of research.  Areas

    18    that we touched on where that might be useful include

    19    leishmaniasis and other infectious disease.  Exactly


    20    what's ongoing at the moment, I think, is unclear to

    21    me as I sit here.  But I'm certain that that's a

    22    resource that many people are thinking about.


    23                DR. BURROW:  Perhaps it's worth explaining

    24    -- the initial in the program -- the initial -- if

    25    somebody identifies himself and wants to be cared for,


                                                                         29

     1    that there is a physical -- this Phase I, the primary


     2    care treatment, which is probably equivalent to a very

     3    thorough executive physical.

     4                If then things are identified in problems

     5    or areas -- it is -- they are referred on to regional


     6    centers where it's really case finding so that it is

     7    not necessarily screening for every environmental

     8    toxin.


     9                But if there were evidence that the

    10    individual might have lead poisoning or have a uranium

    11    slug, it would be looked for.  So it was really case

    12    finding rather than screening.


    13                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Dr. Hamburg?

    14                DR. HAMBURG:  I wonder whether there are

    15    plans for a continuing role for the Institute of


    16    Medicine in relation to the Gulf War health problems? 

    17    And if so, what the nature of that role is likely to

    18    be?

    19                DR. BURROW:  As far as our committee is


    20    concerned we are in negotiation with the Department of

    21    Defense to continue our committee and we should know

    22    then -- obviously by the end of -- that when it ends.


    23                DR. HAMBURG:  Thank you.

    24                And the other committee?

    25                DR. KELSEY:  We're to issue our final


                                                                         30

     1    report in 1996.  And at that point this committee will


     2    be disbanded.  With respect to other activities of the

     3    Institute of Medicine -- Diane?

     4                DR. MUNDT:  None.

     5                DR. KELSEY:  As far as I know, there's


     6    none planned.

     7                DR. HAMBURG:  I wonder if there has been

     8    any consideration of the areas not covered in the


     9    mandates given to the two committees?  There've been

    10    occasions when there has been concern that the IOM was

    11    not really in a position to look into an important

    12    problem because it didn't fall within the mandate of


    13    either committee, implying that perhaps there should

    14    be some new initiative or conceivably even a broad

    15    gauge board to address these problems over the longer


    16    term.

    17                DR. BURROW:  Well, I think in answer, I

    18    mean, our study is really in response to a contract

    19    with the Department of Defense so that we are limited


    20    in those areas.

    21                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Dr. Mundt?

    22                DR. MUNDT:  To my knowledge, there is no


    23    information or no plans for such a board, although it

    24    is an excellent idea.

    25                DR. HAMBURG:  Well, I raise the question


                                                                         31

     1    because it seems to me that this Committee is going to


     2    have to think about the question of whether some kind

     3    of independent scrutiny of the highest level of

     4    objectivity and penetration can be created to go

     5    beyond the life of this Committee.


     6                These problems are not likely all to go

     7    away any time soon.  We heard about long latency

     8    diseases and so on.  I think we will have to address


     9    that.  And obviously the IOM is an institution that

    10    comes to mind as suitable for that role.

    11                I suspect -- at least while speaking for

    12    myself, I think there will be a continuing need for


    13    independent non-governmental scrutiny of the highest

    14    caliber over an extended period of time.  And that's

    15    why I raise the question of an IOM board as one


    16    possibility.

    17                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Well, I would like to

    18    ask Dr. Burrow -- the Comprehensive Clinical Protocol

    19    Exam -- these are done at DOD facilities on active --


    20    people who are still actively in service?  Or, those

    21    who have been discharged, the veterans who have been

    22    discharged, are they included in this common protocol


    23    or not?

    24                DR. BURROW:  No.  They are not.  I mean,

    25    this is specifically a DOD protocol.  And I meant to


                                                                         32

     1    correct something because I may have left that


     2    impression -- is that if it's a veteran who has been

     3    discharged, they could go to the VA hospital, but it

     4    would not be part of the CCEP protocol.

     5                DR. KNOX:  So let me just say that of the


     6    700,000 veterans who served in the Persian Gulf,

     7    according to the data that they have given us in our

     8    notebook, 587,000 have separated from the military. 


     9    So you are looking at a huge population that has

    10    medical services unavailable to them.

    11                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  And it also raises

    12    the question of the selection of this population being


    13    those that are still on active duty when it is

    14    somewhat logical that many of those that would be ill

    15    have already left service.  Can you tell me how


    16    representative you feel this eventual 20,000 will be

    17    of the total group that served in the Vietnam War?

    18                DR. BURROW:  Of the Persian Gulf --

    19                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Of the -- sorry.  The


    20    Persian Gulf.  Apologies.

    21                DR. BURROW:  I think that you raise the --

    22    one of the issues that the committee raised when they


    23    start making comparisons.  I mean, this is a self-

    24    selected group of individuals who have felt that they

    25    -- who were on active duty and felt that they had


                                                                         33

     1    problems and called to do this.


     2                So it is a self-selected sample.  And it

     3    makes it difficult in terms of what the control would

     4    be.  The issue of others -- I don't -- yes -- I'm

     5    saying that the VA has a similar program, but that's


     6    not the question.

     7                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Well, that -- I'll

     8    ask that question to accommodate Diane.  In the VA


     9    program, are they following the same protocol?  And do

    10    you have any information of where they are in theirs? 

    11    How many they have done and whether the data looks

    12    similar or dissimilar?


    13                DR. BRIX:  Yes.  There's a similar

    14    protocol.  And in fact, it is my understanding --

    15    someone from the VA or the DOD should speak up if this


    16    isn't correct -- is that they worked together to

    17    develop the protocol that we have been examining for

    18    the CCEP.  And the VA has a similar protocol.  They

    19    even call their protocol Phase I and Phase II.


    20                I think you heard yesterday something

    21    about the Persian Gulf Registry Exam.  That's also --

    22    that's called Phase I.  So they have a similar Phase


    23    I.  And there are many thousands of people who have

    24    been through that program -- is my understanding.

    25                They also have a Phase II.  Only a small


                                                                         34

     1    handful have been through their Phase II as far as I


     2    understand.  But again, I'm not as familiar with the

     3    VA program as the DOD program.  But they are eligible

     4    for care.

     5                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Those that have gone


     6    through the Phase I -- if this is beyond you we can

     7    just ask staff to get us further information,

     8    obviously, direct from VA -- does it appear similar


     9    that the pattern of illness and symptom diagnoses --

    10    similar among those that have gone through the VA

    11    protocol to the DOD protocol?

    12                DR. BURROW:  I don't think we really know


    13    enough to comment.

    14                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Okay.  Fine.

    15                Dr. Custis?


    16                DR.  CUSTIS:  I would like the Committee

    17    not to be -- not to have the impression that the VA

    18    healthcare system is a paper system.  It's highly

    19    automated.  The patient treatment file is only one of


    20    many computerized systems.  The DHCP, the

    21    Decentralized Hospital Computer Program got started

    22    something like 30 years ago and today compares


    23    favorably with the private medical sector as far as

    24    computerized data is concerned.

    25                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Do you have any


                                                                         35

     1    questions to --


     2                DR.  CUSTIS:  I have no questions for the

     3    panel.

     4                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Dr. Caplan?  Art?

     5                DR. CAPLAN:  I guess I would like to -- I


     6    would like to get clearer about making sure that the

     7    information that needs to be collected about this

     8    problem is getting collected.


     9                In some ways our charge is to make sure

    10    that things are going well and that all that can be

    11    done is being done to identify the nature of Gulf War

    12    illness and problems, and set up infrastructure to do


    13    things about it, both in the future and to compensate

    14    those who may have been injured or become ill now.

    15                And one of the things I find troubling is


    16    this confusion that's broken out just over the past

    17    couple of days about well, is there, is there not Gulf

    18    War Syndrome?

    19                And I'm looking at the response to the


    20    report that you issued yesterday, the August 7th

    21    report, in which you commented on the fact that there

    22    was not enough evidence for the statement that there


    23    was not unique illness or syndrome among Gulf War

    24    Veterans.

    25                My first question to you is:  This report


                                                                         36

     1    appears to have come out after you saw an earlier


     2    draft.  Could you have seen a second draft?  Is there

     3    some reason you didn't see that before this one came

     4    out?  What led you to have to comment after the fact

     5    on this second version of the DOD report?


     6                DR. BURROW:  Our comments were directed to

     7    the first version.  And the DOD -- I can be corrected

     8    by the people next to me -- wanted their report -- I


     9    mean, it was a contract -- early so that they would

    10    have this -- so that we did not see the second report.

    11                And the IOM has a review process it goes

    12    through so that, in fact, the IOM by the time we had


    13    issued our report, they had already issued the second

    14    report without either of us seeing the issue.  Is that

    15    --


    16                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  John?

    17                DR. CAPLAN:  I --

    18                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Oh, I'm sorry.  If

    19    you have another question, please, Art?


    20                DR. CAPLAN:  Is there a need then to make

    21    sure that that sort of situation is rectified?  In

    22    other words, if we'd had an advisory board out there


    23    trying to watch the protocol, and we're getting

    24    announcements that X doesn't exist, and then we have

    25    to have retractions that say well, maybe X exists.


                                                                         37

     1                And there are various methodological


     2    reasons to think that X might exist, that doesn't seem

     3    to be an optimal situation.

     4                DR. BURROW:  I think for an ethicist

     5    that's a fair statement.


     6                (Laughter.)

     7                DR. BURROW:  Let me go on and add.  I

     8    mean, you are reading the first sentence that was


     9    lifted out of the paper.  I mean, we do go on in that

    10    report to say that if there were, as I mentioned

    11    earlier -- as I said, a disability with a high

    12    proportion of veterans at risk, it would probably be


    13    detectable.

    14                I mean, it was the need to couch the

    15    statement that the DOD -- in some terms that would


    16    leave it open.  And it would certainly have been

    17    better to be able to work that out because I think a

    18    lot of it was simply a matter of wording.

    19                DR. CAPLAN:  Let me just ask one more


    20    question about the protocol because this is important. 

    21    Again we want to make sure that people are clear.  I

    22    think we owe it to the veterans and to all Americans


    23    that we not give impressions that are false about what

    24    does or doesn't exist with respect to the illness and

    25    the disease.


                                                                         38

     1                And it plays to my philosophy interest a


     2    bit.  We've got claims we made about who is ill,

     3    what's a syndrome, what's a disease, what's a cluster

     4    of diseases.  And all of these things swirl around

     5    this thing called Gulf War Syndrome which is a lot of


     6    things -- a lot of balls up in the air.

     7                My question is:  When you looked at this

     8    protocol, in particular the Defense Department one,


     9    we've heard one comment that it may be a sampling

    10    problem to talk about Gulf War Syndrome in general.

    11                We want to be careful that we always

    12    qualify that and say on active military.  There


    13    doesn't appear to be a description adequate to say we

    14    have a single disease going on.

    15                But what I am asking is:  Are you


    16    confident, even within that protocol for the active

    17    military personnel, that the reporting by soldiers --

    18    they're going to feel comfortable identifying

    19    themselves to go in for the physicals?


    20                Are you satisfied that the comparison

    21    group that was used was adequate?  In other words, can

    22    you tell us a little bit more -- I don't mean for you


    23    to rehash the whole report -- might be improved upon

    24    in terms of methods for this DOD study?

    25                DR. BURROW:  Well, it would have been at


                                                                         39

     1    the beginning to really have a comparable control


     2    study.  And I tried to -- we emphasized in the report

     3    and the committee felt that -- we felt that in terms

     4    of case finding, I mean, a responsibility to take care

     5    of individuals who had reported themselves not well,


     6    if you will, who had been on active duty -- that the

     7    Department of Defense had merely set up a system of

     8    good quality controls and delivering the best possible


     9    care in an attempt to make a diagnosis of specific

    10    diseases.

    11                Where one gets into less firm ground --

    12    and I think the questions that our co-committee talks


    13    about when you talk about the comparison groups

    14    because then you have to decide who are these

    15    comparison groups.


    16                And I think one has to look at this as a

    17    protocol primarily to deliver care to that group of

    18    individuals.  Hopefully that answers some of the

    19    things you've mentioned.


    20                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  John?

    21                DR. BALDESCHWIELER:  I think it's

    22    important to bear in mind that -- the potential for


    23    causative factors that perhaps have not yet been

    24    identified.  And typically in assays that one performs

    25    you only find those things that you look for.


                                                                         40

     1                That is, with the extremely sensitive


     2    types of immune assays, for example, you only find

     3    those things that you choose to look for.  So it's

     4    crucial, it seems to me -- the process of postulating

     5    potential things to look for is a crucial part of the


     6    process.

     7                Do you have some thoughts as to how one

     8    composes the list of things to look for?  Or how well


     9    that has been done in fact in this search?

    10                DR. KELSEY:  Well, I think that's well

    11    put.  And one of the goals of our work is to look

    12    exactly at how questions are asked.  Because as you


    13    say, you only find what you look for.

    14                If you look well, you are likely to find

    15    the things that can be repeated and the things that we


    16    want to be concerned about.  If you do a poor job of

    17    looking, you are likely to find things that may not be

    18    so important to go after.

    19                So I think one of our real concerns, and


    20    in particular, one of the motivations for issuing a

    21    first report was to stress that people think very hard

    22    about how they are going to look.


    23                We were impressed with the poor job, if

    24    you will, that had been done with coordination and

    25    with initial research.  And this is why we felt the


                                                                         41

     1    pressing need to issue some recommendations for


     2    ongoing work.

     3                And I think your questions are good ones. 

     4    And they are ones that we are very concerned with. 

     5    And our committee has tried to cast the net broadly. 


     6    But the mandate is really about the health

     7    consequences of the war.  And I don't know if you can

     8    get any broader than that.


     9                So we're -- we're trying to cast the net

    10    broadly and begin by really hoping that as research

    11    goes forward the quality can be maintained so that, in

    12    fact, we can really uncover that which we need to


    13    follow up.

    14                DR. BURROW:  I would just simply say that

    15    -- to go back to my earlier statement -- that it's


    16    easier to find a disease that is there than a disease

    17    that isn't there.  And part of the issue that Dr.

    18    Caplan is raising is exactly this question.

    19                I mean, can we say that there isn't


    20    something there that we haven't found.  No.  And so --

    21    that we haven't been able to find it with as complete

    22    a study as, I think, that they could do.  That needs


    23    to remain an open question.  And it's part of the

    24    research.

    25                DR. BALDESCHWIELER:  But quite


                                                                         42

     1    specifically, does there exist an operational list of


     2    things that are being tested for?  And what's on that

     3    list?  I mean, a list of pathogens?  Of potential

     4    environmental factors?

     5                DR. BURROW:  No.  Let me repeat that this


     6    was self-reported individuals who said they were

     7    unwell, who had an initial screening, a very thorough

     8    screening.  And if one could not make a diagnosis,


     9    they were referred on in that at that time it was case

    10    finding.

    11                In other words, if they complained of

    12    musculoskeletal disease, that they were thoroughly


    13    evaluated for anything that was wrong in the

    14    musculoskeletal system.  There was not a screening of

    15    any -- of the whole panel of pathogens or viruses or


    16    environmental toxins.

    17                DR. CAPLAN:  But what -- would that be a

    18    useful component of a future program?

    19                DR. BURROW:  I think it would be a better


    20    -- part of a research program, I mean, set up to

    21    specifically screen, looking for this unit

    22    identification.  There a number of ways of getting at


    23    this.

    24                DR. BRIX:  I could add one thing about the

    25    way the CCEP is designed.  In the referral phase, if


                                                                         43

     1    the person has not been able to reach a diagnosis by


     2    the time they have gone through the initial

     3    examination, they go to a regional medical center.

     4                And there is a set of tests that is

     5    mandated for a variety of symptoms.  And those


     6    symptoms were chosen because they are the types of

     7    symptoms that people are frequently complaining of.

     8                So, for example, for fatigue there is a


     9    list of mandated tests that anybody who goes through

    10    the regional medical center, who has fatigue gets

    11    those tests and those specialty -- subspecialty

    12    consultations.


    13                Likewise, if a person has headaches, they

    14    get a mandated neurological consultation and a CAT

    15    scan of the head and so on.  So there is a protocol


    16    that's laid out very specifically for those symptoms

    17    that are very common in this group.

    18                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  Further follow-up

    19    questions?


    20                DR. LARSON:  Yes.  A follow-up question. 

    21    Really, I don't know if there is anybody on the panel

    22    who can answer this, maybe Dr. Stoto or somebody from


    23    the Institute of Medicine in the audience.

    24                From Dr. Hamburg's question, the Institute

    25    of Medicine for years has been the repository of the


                                                                         44

     1    data base called the Medical Follow-up Study, which


     2    includes data from several wars.  I think from World

     3    War II, the Korean Conflict, Vietnam.

     4                And I think there are some limitations, as

     5    I understand it.  In the past it has been a data base


     6    of primarily, if not completely, white males.

     7                And given that that's fixed, and that the

     8    data base is expanded to be more representative of who


     9    is in the wars, is that a potential source of -- or a

    10    repository for data on the Persian Gulf Conflict that

    11    could be used for long-term follow-up?

    12                I'm not even sure what's in that data


    13    base.  Maybe you could give us some information.

    14                DR. MUNDT:  We -- I am, in fact, staff in

    15    the medical follow-up agency.  We do studies in


    16    veteran populations on cohorts of data that have been

    17    assembled over the years for various purposes.

    18                And you are correct.  They are primarily

    19    in white male veterans.  There are projects being


    20    conducted in atomic veterans and in veterans exposed

    21    to microwaves, etc.

    22                The cohorts are formed primarily to do a


    23    specific study.

    24                There are several hundred cohorts.  We

    25    have no cohort data related to Persian Gulf Veterans


                                                                         45

     1    and Persian Gulf service at this point in time.


     2                DR. LARSON:  But you could?

     3                DR. MUNDT:  Potentially, yes.

     4                CHAIRPERSON LASHOF:  David?

     5                DR. HAMBURG:  I want to ask about the


     6    possibilities for a beneficial interplay between IOM

     7    committees and the government agencies, particularly

     8    the DOD.  In part, my question articulates with what


     9    Arthur Caplan raised a few minutes ago.

    10                The question is on the one hand

    11    stimulation by IOM committees -- for the committees

    12    from the agencies that have problems and bring the


    13    problems to the IOM and say please help us figure this

    14    out.

    15                But on the other hand particularly


    16    focusing on the feedback from the IOM committees to,

    17    let's say, the Department of Defense, not only with

    18    respect to procedure as we heard -- is this curious

    19    disjunction in procedure in the past couple of months


    20    about the latest version of the DOD report, which I

    21    find puzzling and troubling frankly, but putting that

    22    to one side -- substantive issues, for example, in


    23    your report, Dr. Burrow, your very interesting report,

    25    with the likely -- say that it's likely that at least


                                                                         46

     1    a few CCEP patients have developed illnesses that are


     2    directly related to their Persian Gulf Service.

     3                And it gives some categories.  And your

     4    third category is psychological stress during or

     5    immediately after the war.


     6                And you go on to say the basis for

     7    research in many fields, of course -- it's important

     8    to understand that such stressors produce adverse


     9    psychological and physical effects that are as real

    10    and as potentially devastating as chemical or

    11    biological stressors.

    12                And you comment that the psychological


    13    stressors of the Persian Gulf war have been

    14    insufficiently examined by the DOD.  That seems to me

    15    a very important issue, a very constructive suggestion


    16    that you make.

    17                There is by now a vast body of research on

    18    the biology and psychology and severe stress that it

    19    appears not to have been adequately taken into account


    20    recently.  Although I may say the DOD has a

    21    distinguished tradition of research in this field.

    22                For example, the Walter Reed Army


    23    Institute of Research going back to the 1950's.  But

    24    it seems to me that's an example.  There are other

    25    examples in here of a possible connection between the


                                                                         47

     1    IOM's work and the DOD.


     2                Is it possible in real time to give them

     3    feedback perhaps in more depth beyond the printed page

     4    that would help the DOD to address the stress problem

     5    or other currently neglected problems that are really


     6    salient and should be addressed?

     7                DR. BURROW:  I think a great deal of that

     8    interchange went on at our committee meetings, which


     9    really involved interacting with the physicians that

    10    were carrying out the program and a number of

    11    individuals from Walter Reed and -- specifically in

    12    regard to psychological stressors.


    13                So I think that this is going on.  I mean,

    14    the committee disjunction, if you will, or committee

    15    report disjunctions, needs to be resolved.


    16                But I think that my -- a personal comment

    17    -- that they were trying very hard to look for

    18    physical causes and to attempt not to focus as

    19    strongly on the psychological stressors though they


    20    were aware that those were there.

       THE DEVELOPMENT OF POST-RELATIVISTIC CONCEPTS IN PHYSICS
                    AND ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY ABROAD

                      Rolf Schaffranke, Dr. h. c.
                            Member A.I.A.A.

""Far more is done to the progress of science by skepticism than by
gullibility"". (Dr. Wood, Director R & D, McDonnel-Douglas Astronautics
Div., CA)  NASA - Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA is named after
Samuel Pierpont Langley (1834-1906), an American astronomer, engineer and
architect.

Langley worked out the aerodynamic principles for manned flight.  In
principal, his calculations were correct; but the structural material he
used for wings and engines were insufficient.  In DECEMBER of 1903, the New
York Times published an editorial complaining about his foolish dream and
the associated waste of government money.  The editorial predicted that:
""man would not fly for a thousand years"".  Only 9 days after the editorial
was published, the Wright brothers made their first successful powered
flight at Kitty Hawk, Dec. 17, 1903.  But, again, as late as 1905, the
Scientific American suggested the happening was a hoax - two years after
the event which changed history.  Let's reflect for a moment on the fact
that only in a single lifetime, man has journeyed from Kitty Hawk to the
surface of the Moon!

The analogy to the problem of alternative energies and their development
is, of course, obvious.  We are to educate the preaching orthodoxies.  But
orthodox solutions are no longer enough.  Our system of education can only
give from the past.  The present must operate on inspiration and intuition,
or the future will be lost.  The past no longer has enough of the answers
for arising crisis for which there are no precedents.  To keep pace with
the requirements of the future, we must begin to teach not only what to
learn, but how to learn, how to analyze, how to search for the truth.  Only
then will we be able to recognize the discrepancies between experiment and
dogma and to cope with the problems which appear to be just beyond the
corner.  History has shown again and again that no single individual can
rise above the species without being persecuted.  The reasons for that are:

              Some of the most powerful forces in homo sapiens have
              always been GREED, PRIDE, EGO, FEAR and, above all,
              the DESIRE TO CONTROL OTHERS.

A brand new German book titled ""Energy in Abundance"", which is evidently
creating a considerable impact in the European community, challenges the
contemporary high priests of science, the ""Guardians of the Status Quo"" and
uncovers an almost incredible narrowmindedness and ignorance in science,
politics and economics, ""approaching the criminal"" as the author puts it.
The contemporary waste of genuine intellectual creativity is castigated as
a cultural scandal approaching barbarism.  The book stresses that a truly
promising approach to the so-called energy crisis requires a fundamental
and thorough re-evaluation of the theories, dogmas and axioms which form
the basis of present day science and the foundation of out technology.  As
in the past, the formidable inertia of the establishment is not only based
on inaccurate, incomplete and outdated information, but also requires that
we first demythologize generally accepted claims so-called experts of the
past.  An excellent introduction to this problem is the article ""Resistance
by Scientists to Scientific Discovery"" by Bernard Barber in Science, Vol.
134, pp. 596-602, Sept. 1961, or the paper by Stephan C. Brush in Science
of March, 1974, titled ""Should the History of Science be rated 'X'""?,
culminating with a statement of Huxley:

              ""Authorities"", ""disciples"", and ""schools"" are the
              curse of science and do more to interfere with the
              work of the scientific spirit than all its enemies"".

The former astronaut, Capt. Edgar D. Mitchell, one of our famous
contemporaries, also stressed the need for an open mind!

              ""History has shown time and again that important
              scientific discoveries generally happen only when
              someone steps outside the limits of his traditional
              disciplines and looks at something from a fresh
              point of view.  Then what should have been obvious
              all along comes into focus"".

Those of us who are familiar with the pioneering efforts of Dr. Hans Nieper
of Hanover will Appreciate this statement by an ex-astronaut.

One of the most important cornerstones of today's scientific dogmas dates
back to 1905, more than 3/4 of a century ago.  Lest we forget, television
and radar, jet aircraft and cyclotrons, moonrockets and close-up photos of
the planets of out solar system were nothing but wild fantasies of science
fiction then.

The speed of light was assumed to be constant and the maximum possible
speed in the universe; vacuum was to be a total void.  In reality, the
speed of light as measured in the Michaelson-Morley experiments was not at
all the same in all directions.  The ""ether drift"" still amounted to the
respectable velocity of about five miles per second, and similar results
were obtained by D.C. Miller in a series of experiments extending over 25
years, from 1902 to 1926.

              ""Even worse, the measurements showed such marked
              discrepancies with previous results as to occasion
              a distress call to the US Coast & Geodetic Survey,
              whose surveyors repeatedly remeasured the length
              of the tube and found no error there,"" reported
              the Popular Science Monthly March 1934 issue.
              And it continued: ""More recently, speed of light
              observations only emphasized the apparent erratic
              behavior of the light beam that the scientists were
              attempting to plot.  On some days it seems to travel
              faster than others by as much as 12 miles a second.
              Its speed seems to vary with the season, also in a
              mysterious shorter cycle lasting about 2 weeks.
              Finally, the scientists ended by taking an AVERAGE
              of all the readings which has been announced as
              186,271 miles per second"".

In his paper ""A Critical Look At The Theory of Relativity"", Library of
Congress Cat. No. 77-670044, F.K. Preikschat compiled all known light
velocity measurements during the past 300 years or so, from Olaf Roemer in
1676 to the Laser measurements conducted by the National Bureau of
Standards (USA) in 1972.

Of the 27 experiments undertaken in this field, 18 of them after the turn
of this century, it must be concluded that the velocity of light as
measured within the reference system of our Earth has changed as much as
plus/minus 50 km/sec during the past century.  Preikschat plotted a curve
of these deviations and suggests a possible relationship between sunspot
activities and changes of the Earths magnetic field during the time period
in question.

The ""universal constancy of light"" appears, therefore, as somewhat shaky
""empirical evidence"" for our cornerstone in physics, especially since
Einstein himself has gone on record as saying:

              ""If a single one of the conclusions drawn from it
              (relativity) proves to be wrong, it must be given
              up; to modify it without destroying the whole
              structure seems to be impossible"".

Another modification concerns the definition for the term ""vacuum"" in
physics, as documented by a paper in the American Scientist, March-April
1980, titled ""Is The Vacuum Really Empty?"" by Prof. Walter Greiner, Univ.
of Frankfurt, BRD, and Prof. Joseph H. Hamiliton, Vanderbilt Univ.,
Nashville, TN.

The authors conclude that a neutral vacuum is by no means as ""empty"" as the
previously claimed in our textbooks, and suggests a new definition as
follows:

     ""The vacuum is the lowest stable state that a region of
     space can have WHILE BEING PENETRATED BY CERTAIN FIELDS"".

Because of the tremendous time lag in our educational system, many
research projects and their ensuing experimental data have been withheld
from public scrutiny.  The scientific community tends to have a vested
interest in preserving the system it created and of which it is a part.  It
responds to new situations through the coloration of this attachment.  A
case in point are the carefully conducted experiments of T.T. Brown with
charged bodies in a high vacuum, as described in mt booklet Ether Fields
(1977).  These experiments suggest the actual presence of certain fields in
vacuum, whether we call them gravitaional field, tachion-field, ether
field, neutrino or Fermi-sea, etc. is of secondary importance at this
moment.  Although Brown spent, reportedly, more than $200,000 of his own
funds over several decades on such experiments, h

    John Michael Osbourne, (known as ""Ozzy"" to his fans), has in his long 
career as vocalist for Black Sabbath had his work with the group misconstrued 
as advocating Satanism.  In a 1983 radio special featuring Ozzy, the 
interviewer expressed precisely this point; ""...Ozzy has always been shrouded 
in the darkest of Satanic imagery.  Yet if you really listen to his music, 
you'll find that what he is saying differs greatly from his image....""(1)  Even 
the group's image has often been described as ""occult and diabolic"".(2)

    The important point to remember here is to differentiate between appearance 
and reality.  Although the name ""Black Sabbath"" conjures up images of witches 
and sorcerers paying homage to Satan for the powers bestowed upon them, this 
does not make it safe to assume that the group that went by this name 
necessarily drew the inspiration from the occult.(3)  The closest they ever 
came to it was a gothic horror film featuring Boris Karloff as narrator; they 
adopted their name directly from the name of this film.(4)  Black Sabbath was 
involved in the black arts as much as Karloff practiced casting spells off-
screen.  Tony Iommi, the group's guitarist, summed it up best when he described 
the group as having basically ""...the same appeal as a horror movie.  It's all 
an act.""(5)










    Just as their film counterpart did, Ozzy and Sabbath found the occult 
mythos to be an effective vehicle for powerful social commentary; particularly 
when put in the context of heavy-metal rock and roll.  Ozzy himself noted that 
there are ""...people who pick up my [album] cover[s] and go...'This guy's got 
to be singing about Devil, doom, death and destruction.'  Which is not the 
case....""(6)

    The late Lester Bangs likened the group to Bob Dylan and William Burroughs, 
describing them all as ""...moralists...trying to deal with a serious present 
situation in an honest way....""(7)  Ozzy and Black Sabbath merely bring to 
light the many evils of our world in their work, to try and make us realize 
that we are all victim to their influence.  They hope to make us recognize 
these evils so that we may take up arms against them; a point Ozzy emphatically 
stresses:  ""...one thing everybody has got to understand about Black Sabbath's 
lyrics.  They're not downer lyrics, they're just telling everybody where it's 
at...""(8)  He also cites the group's most controversial tune, ""Black Sabbath"", 
as a response to the ignorant hippie culture still force when the tune was 
written in 1970:  ""The hippies said: 'The world is beautiful man.' (sic)  You 
only had to look around you to see how crappy it was.  It was ridiculous 
listening to that stuff, let alone playing it, so we just wrote about the world 
the way it really was and how it affected us - and we felt better in ourselves 
because we were really being honest....""(9)

    In this piece, the group asserts a belief in an afterlife and spiritual 
redemption.  As grisly as the image of a hanged pontiff is, its shock value is 
a necessary part of the message:  They reject religious dogma, stating that a 
belief in God, in one's own heart, is the only guiding light to help one inn 
his life (lines 11/12, 39/40).  Furthermore, the reject religious hypocrisy 
(lines 5/6, 7/8) and peer pressure (verses III, IV) as excuses for not 
accepting God.  To clarify further:  following the crowd does not justify 
shrugging responsibility for one's own actions.

    After re-reading, it becomes obvious that this song is an ascerbic critique 
of atheism; (line 35/36) I refer here again to verses three and four.  In these 
two verses, the picture painted in one of Godless conformity and how it's 
viewed as being as foolish as Paganism.  These lyrics set an example for the 
listener by relating personal experience (lines 13-16).  However, for those who 
cannot accept this the group has no recourse but to condemn them, although 
rather ironically; they hope that their rhetorical loss of faith in the 
listener will open his eyes (line 42).

    The all time controversy winner!  Is this not irrefutably  THE song about 
Black Magic in rock?  It's all so obvious, suffuse with evil imagery; Satan, 
walls of flame, figure in black, and damnation at the end.  Yes, I see the 
images too; it definitely concerns Black Magic.  Then again, Shakespeare's 
Macbeth employed scenes of witches involved in conjurations; does that mean 
that Shakespeare was a warlock?  Poe used to write sardonic tragedies about 
twisted murderers and the bizarre nature of acts, did that make him an evil, 
leering, demented killer?  Did either of them advocated what they wrote about?  
One has to remember that writing about something is not necessarily the same as 
emulating it.  Tony Iommi spoke out quite strongly about this:  ""People are 
bringing us down saying that we are a Black Magic group.  I think they must be










getting mixed up with Black Widow.  We don't do any sacrifices on stage, and 
we're not on a black magic kick.  We wanted to do heavy numbers and the guitar 
riffs we worked out were more suited to evil things than love.  We play songs 
about black magic, but they are more likely to be against than for it.""(12)  

    By now, you're probably asking yourself who Black Widow is, right?  Then 
it's time for a little history:

        Sabbath, before they were known as Sabbath, had the same line-up but 
two earlier names.  The first one was Polka Tulk, which seemed sure to doom 
them to obscurity.(13)  The soon realized this and changed the group's name to 
Earth.  Now, Earth was a blues band at the end of the English blues boom.  As 
if that wasn't bad enough, they soon discovered that not only was there another 
group named Earth, but they had also released a single.  To avoid confusion, 
they changed their name again.(14)  But what made them decide on that name?  
Just ask Ozzy:  ""I just liked the name Black Sabbath because of the succession 
of vowel sounds.(15)  If that sounds ludicrous just consider this:  Sabbath was 
""...the first of the really committed, loud and heavy bands...""(16)  They 
needed a name to match the gut-wrenching power they were developing.  Tony knew 
that he wanted Sabbath to be noticed above all the rest of the British blues 
bands:  ""We wanted something of our own that we'd like and people would like.  
And we wanted something loud!""










    Tony didn't hate the blues.  He'd cut his teeth as a guitarist on the likes 
of The Shadows, Buddy Holly and Django Rheinhardt, developing his own style 
from there.  But he realized the group had no future in the blues:

        'We couldn't keep playing 12-bars forever.  We just got fed up with 
Earth music.  It was jazz, blues stuff.  It was good for practice but nothing 
else.'

    In the late 'Sixties, blues groups were a dime a dozen in Birmingham and 
interest was waning in the blues boom due to the glut of groups.  One man, by 
the name of Jim Simpson, had heard Earth around the Birmingham club circuit and 
understood what they were trying to do.  He decided to take them under his 
wing.  With the aid of his massive record collection, Jim expanded the group's 
horizons in the areas of jazz and blues.  He introduced them to artists like 
Wes Montgomery, Count Basie and Jimmy Rushing.  It was from Rushing in 
particular that they derived the repetitive riff style so readily noticeable in 
their later incarnation as Black Sabbath.

    The Count Basie influence is evidenced in the song ""Wicked World"" from the 
first album; Sabbath drummer Bill Ward uses a ""'sighing hi-hat'...in the manner 
of Basie's drummer Jo Jones.""










    The influence is subtle, almost subliminal.  Yet it is one which was not 
thought capable of hard, 'heavy' rock bands in the late 'Sixties.  Although Led 
Zeppelin and Jimi Hendrix also had their work steeped in blues and jazz 
derivations (Hendrix' ""Third Stone From the Sun"" and Zeppelin's version of 
Willie Dixon's ""I Can't Quit You Baby"" from their first album), neither was 
able to match the intense energy of Black Sabbath.  Iommi has always had a 
preference for music with an original, distinct style of its' own; as an 
example, he mentions guitarists Joe Pass and Alvin Lee as two of his strongest 
songwriting influences.

    It would also be necessary that Sabbath develop a unique, distinctive style 
and image of their own.  Though they had changed their name from Earth to Black 
Sabbath to avoid confusion with the other Earth; at the same time another group 
emerged by the name of Black Widow ""...who WERE profoundly influenced by the 
occult, had a male witch as a patron, and wrote pieces like ""Come to The 
Sabbat.""  Unfortunately, Sabbath was constantly reaping the benefits of Widow's 
publicity.

    Sabbath was a group that never minced words.  If they saw something as 
destructive, they would be sure to rub the listener's face it it.  They did not 
want their point to be missed.

    With their straightforward, sometimes brutal way of looking at things, they 
try to shock the listener's conscience back into awareness.  The imagery of 
""Hand of Doom"", from the Paranoid album, is candid and condemning; it is a 
strong statement against drug addiction and rightly so...

    Many people felt the group's overall direction was pessimistic and had a 
negative effect on its listener's due to that.  ""Ozzy insisted that if people 
thought he was having a bad effect on the minds of young kids, they should go 
and watch the TV news where real murder and mayhem were a way of life, and 
shown night after night."" (18)

    Sabbath was never negative in their message; they were simply truthful 
about waht they saw as wrong in the world.  If you ""Strip away the horror 
stories, the imagery and the hysteria, (and) turn down the amps a notch...you 
have a well-rehearsed, solid blues and rock band, powered by a dedication to 
well defined objectives.""  On the top of the list of those objectives was 
truth; Sabbath never feared facing that truth squarely, regardless of what many 
people thought of them.

Long, long, time ago,
I can still remember,
When the local calls were ""free"".
And I knew if I paid my bill,
And never wished them any ill,
That the phone company would let me be...

But Uncle Sam said he knew better,
Split 'em up, for all and ever!
We'll foster competition:
It's good capital-ism!

I can't remember if I cried,
When my phone bill first tripled in size.
But something touched me deep inside,
The day... Bell System... died.

And we were singing...

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

Is your office Step by Step,
Or have you gotten some Crossbar yet?
Everybody used to ask...
Oh, is TSPS coming soon?
IDDD will be a boon!
And, I hope to get a Touch-Tone phone, real soon...

The color phones are really neat,
And direct dialing can't be beat!
My area code is ""low"":
The prestige way to go!

Oh, they just raised phone booths to a dime!
Well, I suppose it's about time.
I remember how the payphones chimed,
The day... Bell System... died.

And we were singing...

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

Back then we were all at one rate,
Phone installs didn't cause debate,
About who'd put which wire where...
Installers came right out to you,
No ""phone stores"" with their ballyhoo,
And 411 was free, seemed very fair!

But FCC wanted it seems,
To let others skim long-distance creams,
No matter 'bout the locals,
They're mostly all just yokels!

And so one day it came to pass,
That the great Bell System did collapse,
In rubble now, we all do mass,
The day... Bell System... died.

So bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

I drove on out to Murray Hill,
To see Bell Labs, some time to kill,
But the sign there said the Labs were gone.
I went back to my old CO,
Where I'd had my phone lines, years ago,
But it was empty, dark, and ever so forlorn...

No relays pulsed,
No data crooned,
No MF tones did play their tunes,
There wasn't a word spoken,
All carrier paths were broken...

And so that's how it all occurred,
Microwave horns just nests for birds,
Everything became so absurd,
The day... Bell System... died.

So bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

We were singing:

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?

I hear Valkyries a-comin                There are people into Voodoo
In the air their song is comin          there are people into Voodoo
They forgot the words! They're hummin!  I know I do, I hope you do!
But they're good enough for me!         and it's good enough for me!

We will venerate Bubastis             We will read from the Kabahlah

We will all bow down to Enlil       There are some who practice Shinto
We will all bow down to Enlil       there are some who practice Shinto

With bold Gilgamesh the Brave!      but that's good enough for me!

We will all see Aphrodite               We will all sing Hare Krishna
Though she's pretty wild and flighty    We will all sing Hare Krishna
She will meet us in her nightie         It's not mentioned in the Mishna
And she's good enough for me!           But it's good enough for me!

It was good enough for Loki         We will all go to Nirvana

He thinks Thor's a little hokey     Make a left turn at Urbana
and that's good enough for me!      And you'll see the Promised Land!

Here's to those who copy Conan    There will be a lot of lovin
Here's to those who copy Conan    when we're meetin in our Coven
They're just Followers of Onan    Quit yer pushin and yer shovin
and that's good enough for me!    So there's room enough for me!

We will have a mighty Party           It was good enough for Sappho
In the honor of Astarte               With her lady on her lap-o
Grab your chiton - don't be tardy     She put Lesbos on the map-o
'Cause she's good enough for me!      With her pagan poetry!

Shall we sing a verse for Venus,    Well the Christians all are humming
Of the Gods she is the meanest,     Cause they say their God is coming,
Cause she bit me on my...elbow      Our God came three times this evening
And it's good enough for me.        And that's good enough for me.

We will worship like the Druids,      Some guys have a circumcision
Drinking strange fermented fluids,    On account of their religion,
Running naked through the woo-ids,    An embarrassing incision
Coz that's good enough for me.        Cut just ENOUGH from me!   

We will sing a verse for Loki       It was good for old Jehovah
He's the old Norse god of Chaos     He had a son who was a nova!
Which is why this verse don't       Hey there, Mithras! Move on ova'!
       rhyme or scan or nothin'     Another resurrection Day!
But it's good enough for me...

It was good for Thor and Odin       It could be that you're a Parsi

There are those who, when they've got e-
Normous problems that are knotty
They just take them to Hecate         Thanks to great Quetzacoatl
And that's good enough for me!        And his sacred axolotl
                                      And his gift of chocolatl

Let us sing the praise of Horus    We went off to worship Venus
As our fathers did before us       By the Gods! You should have seen us!

And we sing in harmony!            But that's good enough for me!

Montezuma liked to start out             There's that lusty old Priapus 
Rites by carrying a part out             He's just itching to unwrap us.

We will all bow down to Allah     Where's the gong gone? I can't find it

I was singing Hari Rama              We will pray with those Egyptians
With my friend the Dalai Lama        Build pyramids to put our crypts in

But that's good enough for me        which is good enough for me.....!

One-eyed Odin we will follow      We will pray to Zarathustra
And in fighting we will wallow    And we'll pray just like we usta

Which is good enough for me!      And that's good enough for me!

Hare Krishna gets a laugh on         I'll arise at early mornin'

We will sing a verse for Eris           Of Great Murphy much is spoken
(Golden apples for the fairest!)        For his Law shall not be broken

But she's good enough for me!           Things go wrong for you and me!
 
We will sing for great Diana         If your god of choice is Squat
Who will teach of love and honor     Well then trendy, man, you're not -

I'll sing some songs to Lilith,      Now Danae was sweet as flowers,

but She's good enough for me!        And that's good enough for me!

Well, that's good enough for me!     To know that's right for me!

Lilith wears a lacy nightie        That Bob Larson shrieks and hollers
And She is a little flighty        Fighting demons in his callers

She's wet-dream enough for me!     And that's good enough for me.

We will worship with the Fundies       L. Ron Hubbard liked precision
With their itchy hair-shirt undies     And he founded a religion
If they don't bring ""Mrs. Grundy,""     That has caught a lot of pigeons
Then it's good enough for me!          And it's good enough for me!

We will worship Holy Ford              We will worship with the witches
Beta, Delta, Gamma, Lord               'Cause we're rowdy sons-of-bitches

A Brave New World for you and me!      And that's good enough for me!

There are those who follow Crowley     Some folks pray to the Orishas

There are those who scream and hollar  There are those who worship Satan

Who is good enough for me!             That ain't good enough for me!

There are those who worship no gods     Some folks worship the Kachinas

Some folks worship all of Nature            We will read from the Cabala.
Tho they love to taunt and bait-cher        Quote the Tree of Life mandala

And they're good enough for me!             Yet it's good enough for me.

Some folks pray to the Great Spirit   There is room enough in Hades
Most folks just cannot get near it    For lots of criminals and shadies

To the tune of Handel's ""Largo""      Praise to Popacatapetl
We will hymn the gods of cargo       Just a tiny cigarette'll

And that's good enough for me.       So he's good enough for me.

We will drive up to Valhalla         We will all bow to Hephaestus
Riding Beetles, not Impalas          As a blacksmith he will test us

And that's good enough for me.       So he's good enough for me.

We will sing of Iluvatur,             We will sing of Foul the Render,
Who sent the Valar 'cross the water   Who's got Drool Rockworm on a bender
To lead Morgoth to the slaughter      In his cave in Kiril Threndor--
And that's just fine with me.         They're both too much for me.

                                             IMPERIUM COMPOUND    
                                             (Atenveldt Verses)

   Now here's a story, a little bit gory,
   A little bit happy, a little bit sad.
   About a drink called Imperium Compound
   And how the SCA's been had!                       

   Chorus: Oh we think, we think, we think,
           The King is a fink, a fink, a fink,
           A figure of respectability
           Rules the Kingdom thru Imperium Compound
           The results are plain to see!

   Mongol Hordemen, those free-living swordsmen
   Subverting the Kingdoms from underneath!
   Have no use for Imperium Compound
   Except perhaps to brush their teeth!

   AltChorus: Oh we fink, we fink, we fink,
              The Khan and the Kink, the Kink, the Kink,
              And the Board, their Great Senilities!
              The Western Irgun, drinks Imperium Compound
              And we're BACK, with results you'll see!    

   Lady Laurel, with Authority Royal,
   Passes and rejects our heraldry
   She needs a swig of Imperium Compound
   Then perhaps she'd deign to talk to me!            

   Lady Trude thought it her duty
   To turn a social wrong into a Right
   Proved her point with Imperium Compound
   And showed that Cheshire Cats can fight!  //and scratch//

   The Board of Directors styled themselves The Electors
   And another con they tried to swing
   Now the BoD drinks Imperium Compound
   So we no longer need a King!                        

   AltChorus: Oh the Bod, the BoD, the BoD,
              It thinks it is God, is God, is God,
              The figure of Supreme Authority!
              And if we O.D.'d on Imperium Compund
              there'd be no need for Royalty!          

   Oh, MEDIEVAL Net, we thought it was all wet
   With witty remarks, and other kinds of sass
   We'll feed our computers on Imperium Compound
   And BYTE the BoD right on its' righteous ass!         

   Good old Duncan was often drunken
   Chasing all the ladies fair
   He bathed himself in Imperium Compound
   Now he has a little savoir faire!                     

                    (more)


  ATEN IMPERIUM (cont.)

   Ioseph of Locksley, never changes his socks, he
   Runs around looking like a Cavalier,
   He stocked up on Imperium Compound
   And he has enough to last for years and years!        

   AltChorus: Oh they forgot, forgot, forgot
              The Locks-e-ly Plot, the Plot, the Plot!
              And it works the best when it is underground!
              It isn't a hassle for a green-and-white tassle
              They're the ones that BREW Imperium Compound!  

   Trelon of the Wood, he was very good, he
   Was a leader that had never been beat before;
   But Caid had Imperium Compound,
   And Imperial Roman Caid won the War!  //with help!//   

   In Tyr Ysgithr, it's regularly whispered there
   That the Kingdom is ruled over by a King    // What's THAT? //
   They're ""democratic"" and quite erratic....
   They've forgot the purpose of the whole damn thing!     

   King Sir Mark von, with his pretty white suit on,
   Rules the Kingdom both with Grace and Purity!
   He never touches Imperium Compound
   At least not where anyone else can see!               

   Duke Sir Deaton, was never beaten
   On the field, or in the drinking hall;
   At the Catbox War with Caid,
   Left thirty bodies piled against the wall!             

   Denis O'Titans was good at smitin'
   A Locksley Monster in every single way!
   Drank a little Imperium Compound
   And ATE Deaton's sword that day  // No! REALLY! //       

   Wotan the Mongoloid, a little bit paranoid,
   But a nice guy none the less;
   Drank a mess of Imperium Compound
   Now he's Justin du Roc, I confess!                       

   Then there's Duke Reynard, with a face like a St. Bernard
   Of the Dukes, he is the homliest
   He tends to toke up on Imperium Compound
   And go out and whomp on anybody's best!                   

   This song'll bedevil the folks at a revel,
   And most of the time it will annoy the King,
   So take a drink of Imperium Compound
   And let's go Royalty-bedeviling!                        

   Duchess Anna is quite a fan-a
   Going on a wartime shopping spree!  \\ War Point!\\
   Took a drink of Imperium Compound
   And shopped so fast we couldn't see! \\ Z-o-o-o-om!\\    (5)

                     (more)


  ATEN IMPERIUM (Cont.)

   Lyn of Whitewolfe, made of the right stuff,
   Twice the Queen of Atenveldt;
   Took a drink of Imperium Compound
   And the Kingdom of Caid before her knelt!              

   Duke Sir Brion, and Duke Sir Trelon,
   Won the Crown with regularity;
   Drank a lot of Imperium Compound,
   And founded a dynasty!                                 

   Stephan von Geist, was most awful nice,
   And a chivalrous fighter without any doubt
   Took a swig of Imperium Compound
   And won the Crown his first time out!                    

   All the Crusadenes were big, but not mean,
   And the finest fighters in the town.
   But they all drank Jerusalem Compound,
   Winning Crown after Crown after Crown!                 

   Good Duke Arthur couldn't get no farth-er
   A Norman King in Aten Land
   Drank too much of Imperium Compound
   And went off to conquer Engel-land!                    

   Then King Richard, a bit of a bitch, heard
   A King's Crown could be done.
   Drank a little Imperium Compound
   And became the Aten King, first one!                    

   Duchess Malinda, who doesn't do windas,
   But she does a lot of Duchess Things,
   But give her a LOT of Imperium Compound,
   And she sings and sings and sings and sings and sings!   

   Duke Sir Brion, with his pretty white suit on,
   Is a model of goodness and purity
   Never touches Imperium Compound
(spoken:) And I'll sell ya seashore property in Yuma, too!  

   Optional last verse:

   Many tales abound of Imperium Compound
   And its' strange effects on Royalty,
   But after an hour, this song has no power,
   And by now, it's boring ME!                            

   AltChorus: Oh it's too long, too long, too long
              To sing the whole song, the song, the song
              Longer than a Royal Court, it is!
              But sing it serial, this ditty Imperial
              And you'll be a bardic whiz!

                          WTP-0002C

        Last night I had the strangest dream in this bleak century
        I dreamed that people the world around believed in Chivalry

        I dreamed I saw a Kingly Crown enshrined in laurel leaves
        with Grace and Joy and Purity attendant at his feet

        I dreamed I saw the perfect Knight receive his accolade
        and minstrels sang and children laughed in some soft forest glade

        I dreamed I saw the finest thing that ever man could make
        grow great and strong and undefiled: Pray God I never wake!

        Last night I had the strangest dream in this bleak century
        I dreamed that people the world around believed in Chivalry

               (to the tune of ""Good King Wenceslaus"")

                Locksley Monsters never yield
                on the field of battle
                strike the helm and bash the shield
                make their eyeteeth rattle
                Bodies on the ground will lie
                bones will burst in sunder
                search for Locksleys' enemies:
                You'll find them six feet under!

                              SONG OF IVANOF

            There is a man who we know well that does the best he can
            but he's displayed in armour made of reticulated garbage cans!

            He looks so fine and fair and strong, oh how he plays the man
            and how it's prized, those galvanized, reticulated garbage cans

            The noblest Roman of them all, a good Praetorian
            a combatant who wears no pants, judst reticulated garbage cans!

            Like old Horatius at the Bridge, like the Legions of Valerian
            (O dearie me: those LOVELY knees!)
            and those reticulated garbage cans!

         (sung to the tune (obviously) of the 12 Days of Christmas)


1.           The first time I sent my device, The Heralds said to me

            ""It violates the Rule of Three""

2.           The next time I tried it, the Heralds said to me

            ""We changed the forms, and it violates the Rule of
             Three"".

3.           The third time I tried, and the Heralds said to me, 

            ""We upped the fees, we changed the forms, and it
             violates the Rule of Three"".

4.           Another time I tried and the Heralds said to me,
 
            ""We haven't got it, we upped the fees, we changed the 
             forms, and it violates the Rule of Three"".

5.           The fifth time I tried it, the Heralds said to me,  

            ""In a decision rendered by the College of Arms on
             August 1st, A.S. V it was decided that this style of
             heraldic design was not appropriate to the aims and 
             intentions of the Corporate Body. Holy! Holy! Holy! ""

 note: verse 5 is delivered in an extremely fast, mono-
       tone, similiar to a Gregorian Chant.

           "" ....we haven't got it, we upped the fees, we changed the forms,
             and it violates the Rule of Three.""

6.           I tried it a sixth time, and the Heralds said to me,

            ""We changed the rules, &c""

7.           A seventh time I tried and, the Heralds said to me,

            ""It's against the Rule of Tincture, we changed the
             rules, &c""

8.           I tried it once again and the heralds said to me,

            ""It's not a Period design, It's against the Rule of Tincture, We
             changed the rules, &c""

                                * more *



    Heralds Said To Me (cont.)

9.           I sent it in once more, and the Heralds said to me,

            ""We changed the rules again, It's not a Period design,
             it's against the Rule of Tincture, we changed the
             rules, &c""

10. (sung in cold anger)
             The LAST time I sent my device, the Heralds said to me

    (sung in a state of SMUG)
             ""Someone else has got it, &c""




              (nb: every single one of these reasons has been used by the
              CoA, at one point or another, to reject perfectly good
              heraldry, along with some even MORE stupid.  If the shoe 
              fits....................!!!!!!!!)

                        BUGS ON THE BARONESS
                        Tune: Waltzing Matilda
 
           or: Who was that Vermin I saw you with last, Knight?
   or: There may be Lice on all you Knice, but there ain't no Lice on me

           Once there was a Barony howling in the wilderness
           nestled in the Valley where the River doesn't flow
           and the folks were driven buggy by the insects in the Revel Hall
           Authenticity is wonderful, but this doesn't go!

                   Bugs on the Baroness, bugs on the Baroness!
                   That was the cry that you heard all the day
                   and the scratching can be heard from Ysgithr to Ered Sul
                   why did we come here? Let's go away!

           See them all a scratching, nestled in their armour tight
           the fleas have a melee team that's challenging the field!
           call Truly Nolen! Someone's gotta help us out!
           the crabs are nesting in our helms but we'll never yield!

                   (chorus)

           Dawn comes a-breaking, the bugs have won the Coronet...
           flea-infested Conan-clones in piles upon the lawn
           where is the Barony? The bugs have eaten everyone...
           termites got the stick-jocks, and all their sticks are gone!

                   (chorus)

                          tune: The West's Awake

                  For all the Lands where I have dwelt
                  Oh Atenveldt, Oh Atenveldt
                  till rivers burn and mountains melt
                  lest I forget my Atenveldt
                  From deserts stark to snow-capped peaks
                  from silent lakes and laughing creeks
                  sing: Oh let man find his heart's ease
                  on rocky plains
                  in desert breeze

                  For oft I thought of mighty men
                  who carved a Land with sword and pen
                  and lit a candle, burning bright,
                  that pierced the darkness; stirred the night!
                  tho some are gone their deeds remain
                  this sunny Crown without a stain
                  sing: Oh, their deeds were not in vain!
                  in sunlit days
                  and falling rain.....

                  So raise your banners, blazoned bright
                  Advance the Dream and Shine the Light!
                  in battle's crash and Revel's song
                  raise high the Flag and wave it long!
                  For all the Lands wherein I've dwelt
                  I love you best, my Atenveldt!
                  Sing: Oh the Joy that I have felt!
                  My Atenveldt
                  My Atenveldt

      What the use of wearing panties
      whalebone corsets of your Auntie's
      boxer shorts and other scanties
      best of all is nude
      there's such fun in going bra-less
      now that it's no longer lawless
      'specially if your figure's flawless
      best of all is nude
      nude is what you're born in
      shirts are never torn in
      underwear and lacy flimsies, garter belts and other whimsies
      yards of itchy cloth to put your form in
      ducks all do it, maidens rue it
      even ancient Picts in Britain blue it
      going naked's how to do it
      best of all is nude!

      If your garters aren't elastic
      tie them up in knots fantastic
      (panty hose is something drastic!)
      best of all is nude!
      If you're tired of wearing clotheses
      shed your garment 'mongst the roses
      never mind the old bluenoses
      best of all is nude!
      Nude is best for ducking!
      Worst for horses bucking!
      Moonlit nights will see such sights
          that are very best for fooling round
                              .....and elbows!
      Nudity is grand to see
       a well-known antidote to virginity
      take your clothes off and you'll see:
      best of all is nude!

                   prettiest thing I've ever seen
                   she went down underneath the hill
                   and came back out of her own free will

                   Brian Boru, on Irish ground
                   walked three times the Island round
                   Norsemen came lookin for a fight

                   got six feet of English ground

                   the Legion with it's Eagles bright
                   marched into the Pictish night
                   met them there upon the sand
                   gave em up to the Wicker Man!

                   eight-legged steed and hound of Hel

                   Hi said the Lady dressed in white
                   sang the Day and sang the Night
                   sang the Land and sang the Sea
                   sang the Song, and then sang Me!

                                  fill the cup and blessed be!

                                  From the misty crystal sea
                                  came the Lady to the lea
                                  Sword and Roses in Her Hand
                                  spread their seeds thruout the Land

                                  Came the Stag from oaken wood
                                  saw the Lady where she stood
                                  by the fire burning bright
                                  came to know his heart's delight!

                   Blessed Be: the Day I've found
                   Hail to the Lady, one in Three
                   Present is Past and Past is WE

                   By Oak and Ash and Holy Thorn

               and kept our hands from Hellishe Crime

                    WEAPONS AT THE DOOR

 Being a Polemic concerning the alleged Custom of the West Kingdom concerning 
 checking your Weapons at the Door of the Revel Hall. As the Satire is the 
 Weapon of the Bard, this said Polemic is to be checked at the Door, along with 
 swords, knives, redheaded Ladies and other such Deadly Things.....

         As I roved out to Western Lands to take the Western Air
         I went into a Revel Hall and I saw a Twelfth Night there
         but I was halted at the gate by a Privy Consellor
                 (that's the man who tells the King of the West how to go to
                  the bath room!)
         who told me I would have to check my Weapons at the door

         As I, in my astonishment, stood hung on tenter-pegs
         a Knight came in whose Prouess hung down between his legs
         the Doorman grabbed a greatsword and he struck the Knight full sore
         and gave him a reciept; he left his weapon at the door!

         a Bard was next whose goodly Voice has entertained us all
         but he, too, was prevented from entering the Hall
         and told he could not carry deadly weapons on the floor
         he left his Voice and Harp among the weapons at the door

         a Master entered graciously, a man we all know well
         who holds a 3rd Dan Black Belt, tho this he'd never tell
         the Master struggled valiantly, the Master cursed and swore
         but he left his hands, and feet, as weapons at the door

         the company was jovial, altho a bit dismayed
         for lack of proper cutlery, down to the smallest blade
         for even teeth and fingernails, each can be used in War
         were cut, and pulled, and left behind, as weapons at the door!

         And has their King not loyal Knights that He must be afraid
         of brawling in his Hall and of Assassin's bloody blade?
         the Rights of Men to carry Arms at least WE'VE not foreswore
         and a POX on them that made the Rule of Weapons at the Door!

                           THE STREETS OF ANN ARBOR

               As I walked out thru the streets of Ann Arbor
               as I walked out thru Ann Arbor one day
               I spied a young Mongol all dressed in white linen
               all dressed in white linen and cold as the clay

               I then spied another, done in on the sidewalk
               along with just about six dozen more
               their wounds were all gaping, from mace and from braoadsword
               from claymore and cannon, all dripping with gore

               what caused this grave carnage, I cried to the Monglos
               oh pray what's the reason for this awful sight
               my answer came slowly from under the corpse-pile
               ""It seems that our bark is much worse than our bite.....""

               the answer continued from pale lips a-shaking
               we sang all our songs and believed them as true
               the Dark Horde could never be beaten in battle
               we thought this was what all good Mongols could do...

               we went down to Atenveldt all for to plunder
               ""too large to defend"" was our song every night
               but Atenveldt's different from East, West or Middle
               there, even the bushes have learned how to bite!

               the Clann stole our ponies, the Scraelings our foodstuffs
               we ran into axes in AtenViking hands
               our maidens ran off with one Richard of Arkham
               and we're all that's left to return to our lands

               MacChluarains and Monsters, Lockehaven and Foxmoor
               that Kingdom is BIG and its' fighters are MEAN!
               we fought and we lost, and fled back to Ann Arbor
               we all came back home with results that you've seen

               keep away from that Land with its' cactus and marshes
               it's no place for Mongols who are bent on War
               they count their blows well, but they strick them yet better
               he crawled into his Yurt, and fell, dead, on the floor.....

                            C. A. Bethancourt III
       tune: the song of the Cowardly Lion, Tin Woodsman and Scarecrow
             in the movie version of the Wizard of Oz

        (Enter the Scarecrow, who singeth:)

        My wife is always nagging; my Prowess it is lagging
        I can't do anything
        she has got a reason, but revenge is out of season
        Oh I wish I could be King!

        If I just had the Crown on, I'd always have a frown on
        and the Barons on a string
        Heads they would be rolling, the Board would be cajoling
        Oh if only I was King!

        I am very fed up with the way this group is set up
        Oh I'd change everything!
        they are so high and mighty with the way that they do fight-ey
        Oh, someday I'll be King!

        Tho my wife is melancholic, and very...vitriolic
        she's a wasp without a sting!
        I'd have to supervise her with a pack of tranquilizers
        If I only was a King......

        (the Tin Woodsman joineth him, and singeth:)

        I grew up kind of cocky, and rather big, and stocky
        and straight as any rod
        on the field I'm a battallion, with the Ladies I'm a stallion
        ...Oh they'd better make me God!

        The other boys are jealous they say I'm over-zealous
        they'd do better to applaud
        the things that I am giving to this Dream that we are living
        oh I wish they'd make me God!

        They say that I'm conceited, but I'm just badly treated
        by people and by BoD
        just think of what they're missing by My Majesty dismissing
        Oh they'd better make me God!

        (the Cowardly Lion creepeth forth, and singeth:)

        Oh I could be a fighter, a great and mighty smiter
        and be the perfect knight
        it's a great and nasty shame, and everyone's to blame
        oh I wish that I could fight!

        Song of the Three (cont.)

        I could be a Cavalier drinking wine and ale and beer
        and be a gorgeous sight
        but it would cost me too much money so it isn't very funny
        oh I wish that I could fight!                               

        Let me at 'em on the field, I would surely make them yield
        to my Power and my Might
        with rattan, shinai and rapier they would nevermore escape here
        If they'd only let me fight

                She was afraid to come out to the Tourney
                She was worried that ""something might show..""
                She was afraid to come out to the Tourney
                And the poor thing did NOT want to go...

                  (2 - 3 - 4, tell the people what she wore!)

                  It was an itsy bitsy teeny weenie little rabbit fur bikini
                  That she wore, for the first time, that day.
                  An itsy bitsy teenie weenie little rabbit fur bikini
                  And in her apartment she wanted to stay!

                One day in the Kingdom of the Middle
                It happened at a Tourney one day:
                The Mongols invaded the Middle
                But the Middle did not want to play...

                  (eins - zwei - drei, but the Dark Horde wouldn't die!)

                  It was an itsy bitsy tiny teenie Nauseating Mongol weenie
                  That they saw, for the first time, that day.
                  An itsy bitsy tiny teenie Nauseating Mongol weenie
                  And the Mongols did NOT go away!

                Now the Heralds made up a new Rulebook
                And to read it is some kind of gas!
                It's a bureaucrat's dream, this new Rulebook
                Now NOBODY'S blazon can pass!

                  (Win - Place - Show, tell the Heralds where to go!)

                                 (insert Bronx cheer!)

                  I want an itsy bitsy teenie weenie little rabbit fur bikini
                  On my shield, as my blazon, today!
                  An itsy bitsy teenie weenie little rabbit fur bikini
                  But ""that's offensive"" the Heralds all say!

                I sat down at the Revel last evening
                To a feast of green meat, and Rat Pie...
                It was cold, and disgusting, and greasy
                And I just want to upchuck and die!

                  (6 - 7 - 8, tell them what was on your plate!)

                  It was an itsy bitsy teenie weenie little rabbit fur bikini
                  With a side dish of cold cabbage pie!
                  An itsy bitsy teenie weenie little rabbit fur bikini

                               -Ioseph of Locksley
                                copyright 1972, 1989 W. J. Bethancourt III

          Some folks call me many names, others call me crazy
          Tom O'Bedlam's son am I, for my mind is hazy!
          I'd rather sing a song than work (if it's not too phrasey!)
          Lengthy rhymes don't bother me....truth to tell: I'm lazy!

          Yang, your yurt is very nice, and your Horde is smelly,
          And I'm sure that yak-meat will nicely fill one's belly!
          But remember this one line, or you're not worth jelly:
          FIRST you plunder, THEN you burn! That's how to be rakehelly!

          My Lady Lorelei your eyes do drive me to distraction
          And the lovely Care-Cheri causes....petrifaction!
          But I, and they, quite taken are, so I can't take action...
          Therefore, Ladies, fill my cup; I'll drink to stupefaction!

          Now Atenveldt your fighters, all, are most good and gentle
          And the Ladies, bless 'em all, are most ornamental!
          But that little Nikki-Toad....has me sentimental
          Though with boffer in her hand she is argumental!

          This stupid little song, m'lords, is mostly sung in Latin
          By the Goliards, of course, from vespers clear to matins!
          But I prefer a coarser cloth over silk or satins
          English is more understood, mine enemies to flatten!

          Good People all, I've made my Song, its' music's well-recited
          But my voice could use some work; the flowers it has blighted!
          It's rude and rusty, grim and bad, and squeaky like a door-hinge,
          But I'm a better Bard than you: I found a rhyme for ""orange!""

 (note to verse 4: Nichelle of Whitewolfe is now a very beautiful young Lady

                      by William Poundstone
                              1983

     Two mentalities are at work here: 1960s rock fans and 1980s
fundamentalist Christians. The idea of phonographically concealed
messages dates from the Paul McCartney death scare of 1969. For
hard-core types, the secret-message rumors never really died. Avid
rock fans have auditioned ever album release since the late 1960s
for hidden nuances. Backward messages, barely audible messages,
and messages on one stereo track only have been alleged. At the
other end of the sociosensual spectrum, fundamentalist Christians
have gotten into the act. TV programs such as PRAISE THE LORD and
THE 700 CLUB have propagated rumors of a satanic plot in the
recording industry, no less, in which various albums conceal
""backward-masked"" demonic murmurings. If THAT sounds too spacey to
be taken seriously, consider that it was the fundamentalist groups
who were behind House Resolution 6363, a bill introduced in the
U.S. House of Representatives by Robert K. Dornan (R., Calif.) in
1982 to label all suspect records: ""WARNING: THIS RECORD CONTAINS
BACKWARD MASKING THAT MAKES A VERBAL STATEMENT WHICH IS AUDIBLE
WHEN THIS RECORD IS PLAYED BACKWARD AND WHICH MAY BE PERCEPTIBLE
AT A SUBLIMINAL LEVEL WHEN THIS RECORD IS PLAYED FORWARD."" In
February 1983, the Arkansas State Senate passed a similar record-
labeling bill by a vote of 86 to 0.
     Contributing to the quasi-occult status of these rumors is
the difficulty of checking them out on home audio equipment. You
pretty much have to take someone else's word for it, or dismiss
the rumors out of hand.
     From a technical standpoint, there are four simple ways to
conceal a verbal message on a recording. The most obvious is to
record the message at a very low volume. The message may then be
recovered by turning the volume up while playing the record or
tape. If the message is faint enough, though, noise levels of home
equipment may garble it. If the accompanying music or lyrics are
loud enough, or if the message itself is indistinct or
electronically modified, it may be hard to hear on any equipment.
     A second gimmick is to record a message on one stereo track
only. Records and tapes have two independent recordings, of
course, normally played simultaneously for stereo effect. On a
record, each stereo track occupies on one side of the V-shaped
groove for the needle. On a tape, the tracks are recorded in
parallel lanes of the magnetic material. The two tracks are called
""right"" and ""left"" after the stereo speakers they will play on.
Otherwise, the tracks are interchangeable -- the sound mixer can
put anything he or she wants on each track. A message on one track
can be masked by simultaneous loud music or lyrics on the opposite
track. With normal stereo balance (or mono equipment) the loud
track drowns out the message track. At home, single-track messages
can be recovered by adjusting the stereo balance so that only the
desired track plays. Sometimes this trick also makes indistinct
words clearer. Even if the words are not exclusively on one track,
they may happen to be more audible on one track.
     A message could be recorded at a speed different from the
rest of the record. Then the record would have to be played faster
or slower than usual to recover the message. Unless the message
was at one of the standard speeds (say, 45 rpm on a 33 1/3 rpm
record), it could not be played normally on home equipment.
     The fourth and most commonly alleged trick is to record a
verbal message backward. Reversed speech has several unexpected
features. One is that syllables are not a constant in the reversal
process. A one-syllable word can have two or three syllables when
played backward. Thus ""number nine"" in the Beatles' REVOLUTION 9
reverses to ""Turn me on, dead man"" (or something like it), a jump
from three to five syllables.
     There is no simple way to predict what a word or phrase will
sound like reversed. Obviously, you can't just reverse the
letters.
     Reversed messages are difficult to recover at home. Record
turntables are not built to go backwards. Some have a neutral
setting, in which the pickup and amplifier remain active and you
can turn the record backward by hand. But hardly anyone has a
stead enough hand to produce satisfactory results.
     With patience, it is possible to reverse a cassette
recording. Transfer the music from the original record or tape
onto a blank tape cassette. Place the cassette flat on a table.
Draw our the part of the tape with the suspected message and snip
it off at both ends. Hold the tape segment horizontally. Rotate it
180 degrees, keep it horizontal at all times. This turns the tape
end for end. Splice the reversed tape segment back onto the two
loose ends of the cassette with strong adhesive tape. Reel the
tape back inside the cassette. The sliced segment will play
backward on an ordinary cassette player.
     I rented a recording studio to test the secret-message
rumors. New copiies of the records in question were transcribed on
a quarter-inch master tape. Where rumor alleged that a single
stereo track contained a message, right and left stereo tracks
were transcribed separately. Records with alleged inaudible
messages were treated similarly. To test claims of reversed
messages, recordings on the master tape were edited out and
spliced in backward. Twenty cuts or portions of cuts from sixteen
albums were tested.


""Another One Bites the Dust""
Queen, THE GAME

Rumor: When played backward, the lyrics say, ""It's fun to smoke
marijuana.""
Findings: There is something that sounds like ""It's fun to smoke
marijuana"" in the reversed music. It is repeated over and over. It
might be rendered no less faithfully, however, as ""sfun to scout
mare wanna."" This ""message"" is the reversal of the song title,
which is repeated as a line in the song.
     Let's make a distinction between engineered and phonetic
reversals. When an artist records a verbal statement, reverses it
by turning the tape end for end, mixes the reversed statement onto
a master tape, and has records and tapes produced from the master,
that is an engineered reversal. When the phonetic properties of
song lyrics are such that they can be reversed to sound like
something else, that is a phonetic reversal.
     ""It's fun to smoke marijuna"" is clearly a phonetic reversal.
The lyrics are perfectly plain played forward (""Another one bites
the dust""), no so plain played backward (""sfun to scout mare
wanna""). With an engineered reversal, the opposite should hold
true: gibberish forward, clear as a bell backward. Some are
prepared to believe that phonetic reversals are just as
intentional as engineered reversals -- that the songwriter
painstakinginly planned the phonetic double-entendre. In the
absence of confirming evidence, that just doesn't wash. It's too
easy to find coincidences. If, for example, the letters of the
alphabet are recited in conventional fashion (Ay, Bee, Cee, etc.)
and reversed, at least five sound like English language words. D
reverses to ""eden,"" F becomes ""pray,"" S becomes ""say,"" V becomes
""even,"" and Z becomes ""easy."" ""It's fun to smoke marijuana"" is
likewise a coincidence.


""A Child is Coming""
Jefferson Starship, BLOWS AGAINST THE EMPIRE

Rumor: When played backward, ""son of Satan.""
Findings: Another phonetic coincidence. The repeated ""It's getting
better"" reverses to an iffy ""son of Satan,"" the ""of"" drawn out and
the ""Satan"" strongly accented on the first syllable.


""Eldorado""
Electric Light Orchestra, ELDORADO

Rumor: When played backward, ""He is the nasty one/ Christ, you're
infernal/ It is said we're dead men/ Everyone who has the mark
will live.""
Findings: Coincidence. The supposed message lurks around the line
""On a voyage of no return to see."" Reversed, this passage becomes
the expected syllable salad -- no one hearing it would describe it
as anything but reversed music. Only if you listen while reading
along with what you're supposed to hear will you get anything. The
rumored version of the message is somewhat fudged. The passage
sounds more like ""He's to nasty one/ Christ you are, Christ,
you're fernal/ There wiss uh, we're dead men..."" There is no ""in""
in what is taken to be ""infernal."" The line that is supposed to be
""Everyone who has the mark will live"" isn't even close, though the
syllable count is right.


""Shoo Be Doo""
The Cars, CANDY-O

Rumor: When played backward, the word ""Satan"" repeated
approximately eleven times.
Findings: Coincidence. The rumor refers to the reversal of the ""Shoo
be doo, shoo be doo, shoo be doo..."" near the end of the song. Given
the mysterious logic of reversed phonemes, these three-syllable units
can be hard as a repeated two-syllable word. The word sounds a little
like ""Satan.""


""Snowblind""
Styx, PARADISE THEATER

Rumor: According to a mimeographed list of suspect records distributed
by Congressman Dornan, the words ""Satan move through our voices"" when
played backwards.
Findings: Negative. Despite repeated listenings, it was not even
possible to identify the part of the reversed track that Dornan et al.
are talking about.


""Stairway to Heaven""
Led Zeppelin, untitled, a.k.a. STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN

Rumor: In reverse, ""I live for Satan... The Lord turns me off...
There's no escaping it... Here's to my sweet Satan... There's power in
Satan... He will give you 666.""
Findings: Coincidence. If you listen very carefully to the ""And it
makes me wonder"" lines in reverse, you'll hear something approaching
""There's no escaping it."" A better description is ""There's no escape
do."" Knock of the last syllable, and you have ""There's no escape,"" a
complete, intelligible sentence in reverse. It's there, all right, but
it's not an unlikely enough coincidence to -- well, make you wonder.
      The ""Satan"" in ""I live for Satan"" is good and clear. The ""I live
for"" part isn't. The other alleged lines are unremarkable. All are
phonetic reversals of the entirely lucid forward lyrics and obviously
just accidents.


""When Electricity Came to Arkansas""
Black Oak Arkansas, BLACK OAK ARKANSAS and RONCH AND ROLL

Rumor: In reverse, ""Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan. He is God. He
is God.""
Findings: The BLACK OAK ARKANSAS cut was reversed. Again, pairs of
reversed syllables are being freely interpreted as ""Satan."" ""He is
God"" was not identifiable.


""Rain""
The Beatles, HEY JUDE

Rumor: Unintelligible lyrics at the end are reversed.
Findings: A true engineered reversal and not really a secret. ""Rain""
seems to have been the first popular recording to incorporate an
obviously reversed lyric. The story is that John Lennon accidentally
spliced the last part of the song in backward and liked the effect.
When reversed, the strange-sounding vocals at the end become
intelligible as a reprise starting with the drawn-out word
""sunshine.""
      The reversal is less apparent to the casual listener than it
might be because the accompanying music is not reversed. The ending
fits in smoothly with the rest of the song, the vocals suggesting a
foreign language.


""Fire on High""
Electric Light Orchestra, FACE THE MUSIC

Rumor: When played backward, ""The music is reversible, but time --
turn back!""
Findings: ""Fire on High"" is instrumental. About twenty-six seconds
into the music, scrambled speech is heard. It is mostly louder than
the accompanying music and begins with a two-syllable unit repeated
several times. The seeming speech lasts for about fourteen seconds.
      Reversing the music confirms that there is a true, engineered
message. In reverse, a voice (Jeff Lynne's?) says, ""The music is
reversible, but time -- turn back! Turn back! Turn back! Turn back!""
All the words are clear and unambiguous. Anyone comparing this to the
alleged reversal on ELO's ""Eldorado"" will have no trouble telling
which is genuine.


""Goodbye Blue Sky""
Pink Floyd, THE WALL

Rumor: In reverse, ""You have discovered the secret message.""
Findings: The ""secret message"" is at the very end of the instrumental
passage following the ""Goodbye Blue Sky"" vocals. It comes just before
the words ""What shall we do"" at the start of the song that is
identified as ""Empty Spaces"" on the record label and as ""What shall we
do now?"" on the record sleeve. Played forward, the message is less
apparent than the FACE THE MUSIC reversal: A reasonably attentive
listener might play THE WALL through and not catch it. It suggests
speech not quite close enough to be overheard. In context this is not
unusual because the ""Goodbye Blue Sky"" instrumental passage includes
""airport noises"" and other sound effects. A loud climax in the music
further masks the unintelligible voice.
      When played backward, the voice (Roger Waters?) plainly intones,
""Congratulations, you have just discovered the secret message. Please
send your answer to old Pink, care of the funny farm..."" As the voice
fades out, there may be another word -- perhaps ""Chalfonte or
""Chelsea"" -- after ""funny farm.""


""Heavy Metal Poisoning""
Styx, KILROY WAS HERE

Rumor: A red sticker on the KILROY WAS HERE cover warns, ""By order of
the Majority for Musical Morality, this album contains secret backward
messages...""
Findings: This is a case of second-generation backward-masking. Styx'
PARADISE THEATER did not contain a backward message, though a lot of
people said it did. So Styx has included a sure enough backward
message on KILROY WAS HERE. It is at the very beginning of ""Heavy
Metal Poisoning."" The reversed speech last about three seconds. There
is no musical background. The words reverse to ""Annuit coeptis. Novus
ordo seclorum."" This is the Latin motto encircling the pyramid on the
back of a dollar bill. The usual translation: ""God has favored our
undertakings. A new order of the ages.""
      The cover sticker's ""Majority for Musical Morality"" is a
fictitious Falwellesque group in the KILROY WAS HERE video. Although
the sticker suggests a plurality of ""messages,"" only one was found.


Space between ""I'm So Tired"" and ""Blackbird""
The Beatles, untitled, a.k.a. THE WHITE ALBUM

Rumor: A reversed message. At the time of the Paul-is-dead stories,
the segue from ""I'm So Tired"" to ""Blackbird"" was offered as evidence.
It was held to contain John Lennon's voice, reveresed, saying ""Paul is
dead, miss him, miss him, miss him."" That interpretation seems
unlikely now, but there is a mysterious low muttering between the
songs.
Findings: The mumbling is actually just to the ""I'm So Tired"" side of
the shiny ""space"" between cuts on the record. Each of the stereo
tracks was recorded separately, twice, and a copy of each track was
reversed. This produced four versions of the two-second passage: right
forward, left forward, right reversed, and left reversed. All were
equally unintelligible. It was not even apparent whether the voice is
forward or reversed. Nor could John Lennon be identified as the
speaker. There are nine or ten syllables. The first six (when played
forward) are a two-syllable unit repeated three times. There is little
or no difference betwen the stereo tracks. Any claimed interpretation
of the sounds seems doubtful.


""Strawberry Fields Forever""
The Beatles, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR

Rumor: It was, of course, claimed that John Lennon says ""I buried
Paul"" at the end. (It's forward, at the very end after the music
fades to complete silence, returns, and starts to fade out again.)
But Lennon told ROLLING STONE that the words are ""cranberry
sauce.""
Findings: They are ""cranberry sauce."" The ""sauce""/""Paul"" part is
indistinct, but the first syllable sounds a lot more like ""cran""
than ""I.""


""Baby You're a Rich Man""
The Beatles, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR

Rumor: On one of the tracks the line ""Baby you're a rich man too""
is sung as ""Baby you're a rich fag Jew,"" a dig at Brian Epstein.
Or some think it's ""rich fat Jew"" and claim it as evidence of
Beatle anti-Semitism.
Findings: Negative. The two stereo tracks are nearly identical.
It's always possible to hear words as similar-sounding words, but
basically, the lyrics jibe with the published version.


""Revolution 9""
The Beatles, untitled, a.k.a. THE WHITE ALBUM

Rumor: Various reversed and/or one-track speech. The reversal of
""Number nine"" to ""Turn me on, dead man"" has pretty much been
discounted as coincidence (though it appears on Congressman
Dornan's list).
Findings: Distinction between lyrics and any hidden message blurs
on ""Revolution 9."" The eight-minute cut is a montage of sounds
collected by John Lennon and Yoko Ono. It includes discordant
music, radio broadcasts, sirens, applause, gunfights, sports
cheers, the crackling of a fire, screams, a baby gurgling, a choir
singing, and much that cannot be identified. For this
investigation, ""Revolution 9"" was transcribed four times, twice on
each stereo channel. One copy of each of the tracks was reversed.
The four resulting versions were compared with each other and
against the original two-channel version.
     ""Revolution 9"" contains a lot of talking. Played in stereo,
forward, the longest stretch of understandable speech is probably
an announcer saying, ""...every one of them knew that as time went
by they'd get a little bit older and a little bit slower...""
     One believable instance of reversed speech occurs: someone
saying ""Let me out! Let me out!"" (once held to represent McCartney
in his totaled Aston-Martin). Two iffy reversals occur on the
backward recording of the right stereo track:""She used to be
assistant"" and ""There were two men..."" Neither is clear enough or
long enough to be convincing. Some of the music, including the
recurring theme, sounds more natural in reverse.
     ""Turn me on, dead man"" is a typical phonetic reversal. The
forward ""number nine"" (repeated throughout the cut) is clear; the
reversal is slurred -- something like ""turn me on dedmun."" It has
been claimed that ""number nine"" must be pronounced with a British
accent or with some careful inflection in order to reverse to
""Turn me on, dead man."" This seems not to be so. As an experiment,
three American-accent renderings of ""number nine"" were reversed.
All sound about as much like ""Turn me on, dead man"" as the record
did. Like the other phonetic reversals, ""Turn me on, dead man""
must be considered a coincidence.
     Much of ""Revolution 9"" is on one stereo track only. Near the
end a voice says ""A fine natural imbalance...the Watusi...the
twist...Eldorado...Eldorado."" ""A fine natural imbalance"" is on the
right track only, though the words that follow are in stereo. One
of the longer bits of speech -- ""Who could tell what he was
saying? His voice was low and his [unintelligible] was high and
his eyes were low"" -- is clear on the left track, a bare whisper
on the right.
     There is a stereophonically concealed ""secret message"" on
""Revolution 9."" The words are on the right track. They begin about
four minutes, fifty-eight seconds into the cut and run for about
twenty-two seconds. They are not likely to be noticed in stereo
because of the much louder left track. The sound of applause
begins on the left track at about five minutes, one second into
the cut. Deafening noises -- the clapping, sirens, music --
continue on the left track until five minutes, forty seconds. It
may or may not have been Lennon's and Ono's intention to conceal
the spoken passage. Given the haphazard quality of ""Revolution 9,""
the concealment may have been accidental. To recover the passage,
the left track must be switched off. The right track can then be
heard to contain a sound like a stopwatch ticking, behind these
words:

     So the wife called, and we better go to see a
     surgeon....[A SCREAM MUFFLES A LINE THAT SOUNDS LIKE
     Well, what with the prices, the prices have snowballed,
     no wonder it's closed.] ...So any and all, we went to
     see the dentist instead, who gave him a pair of teeth,
     which wasn't any good at all. So instead of that he
     joined the bloody navy and went to sea.
                      by William Poundstone
                              1986

     There really are backward messages on rock albums. And the
controversy over ""backward masking"" and ""porn rock"" has inspired a
whole new spate of messages. There may have been more genuine
backward messages in the past few years than ever before.
     The backward message controversy is usually traced to the
1960s and John Lennon's avant-garde sound mixing on such tracks as
""Revolution 9"" on the Beatles' WHITE ALBUM. Lennon probably wasn't
trying to conceal a message so much as create an interesting
sound.
     The matter might have ended right there had it not been for
the Paul McCartney death rumor. College kids tried playing Beatles
records forward, backward, and at various speeds to find ""clues""
to McCartney's fate. In the process they found snippets of speech
from Lennon's experiments. Even after McCartney was found safe and
sound in Scotland, some listeners continued to look for hidden
messages.
     Somehow, fundamentalist Christian groups became convinced
(ca. 1982) that the alleged messages were commercials for devil
worship. Not a single indisputable satanic message has turned up,
but there were scattered attempts to ban or label certain albums.
In 1986 one fundamentalist group announced that the theme song for
the old MR. ED TV show contains the word ""Satan"" when played
backward.)
     Ironically, the publicity accorded nonexistent messages has
inspired several artists -- among them porn rock hearing witness
Frank Zappa -- to hide real background messages in their music.
It's easy to do.
     The performer speaks or sings the message normally, then
reverses the tape, which is mixed into the soundtrack. This is all
accomplished simply enough at any recording studio.
     What's not so simple is playing it back. More home record,
cassette, and compact disk players won't play backward. You can
turn a record backward with a pencil eraser, but it's not good for
the needle or the turntable. The only way to reproduce the message
with full fidelity is to use a professional-quality reel-to-reel
tape player and splice the tape in backward.
     We used the facilities of KLOS radio in Los Angeles to
reverse some recent records containing true backward messages.


""Secret Messages""
Electric Light Orchestra, SECRET MESSAGES

ELO's ELDORADO album was among those alleged to contain satanic
backward masked messages. A patient listening to ELDORADO played
backward reveals no such messages. You hear only what you ought to
hear -- the reversed lyrics of the songs, which sound nothing like
the ""messages"" claimed to be there. In the wake of such
allegations, ELO did put an (innocuous) backward message on their
FACE THE MUSIC album. Perhaps they thought this would show how
silly the allegations were. Instead, the backward-masking people
seized on this as proof that the other ""messages"" were real. In
the latest volley, ELO has named an album after the controversy.
     In Britain (where the backward-masking issue is viewed as an
American eccentricity), the cover of SECRET MESSAGES has a mock
warning label to youth about the hidden label. Word of the albums'
impending release in the United States caused enough of a furor to
chill CBS Records into deleting the cover blurb.
     The reversed message is easy to find. It's at the beginning
of the first song, which is itself called ""Secret Messages."" You
can hear reversed speech when you play the record normally. A
voice intones ""secret messages"" -- forward -- in the middle of the
reversed speech, lest anyone dare be so unhip as to not know
what's going on.
     We transferred a new copy of SECRET MESSAGES to reel-to-reel
tapes and played it backward. The backward message goes: ""WELCOME
TO THE BIG SHOW/ WELCOME TO THE BIG SHOW.""
     That's it.


""Ya Hozna""
Frank Zappa, THEM OR US

""Ya Hozna,"" a six-minute composition on the first record of the
THEM OR US double album, is ENTIRELY backward. The albums' inner
cover, which includes lyrics for the other songs, says, ""backwards
vocal -- you figure it out"" of this cut. It credits Frank and Moon
Zappa, George Duke, and Napoleon Murphy Brock as vocalists.
     Played forward, ""Ya Howza"" sounds like a record played
backward -- reasonably so. The vocals are prominent and
unintelligible. Moon Zappa's voice is curiously recognizable, even
in reverse. It is hard to tell whether the music was recorded
forward or backward.
     When ""Ya Howza"" is played in reverse, you discover that the
music is virtually a palindrome -- it sounds about the same
forward and backward. The voices are all backward. In some cases
they have been modified electronically. Many of the words are
muffled. Even after repeated careful listening on both stereo
tracks, it is difficult to make out many of the lyrics. It doesn't
help that some of the words seem to be stream-of-consciousness
nonsense. Some of the unintelligible stuff sounds like opera.
     Starting at the beginning of the reversed tape -- the end of
the forward tape -- the clearer vocals go like this: ""I am the
heaven, I am the water."" This is in a hymnlike register. ""You are
a lonely little girl./ But your mommy and your daddy hold you."" A
singsong synthesizer voice.
     The most interesting part of the lyrics is an intermittently
orgasmic rap in Moon Zappa's Valley Girl voice. There are three
short monologues:

I'm like green!
I'm like squat!
I'm like soul!
Repeat, like soul!
I'm like pull, push,
Okay, like slow, slow.

You're never too old
Like slow, like slow, like slow
Okay, I like it.


All right, faster, faster,
Go, do it, do it twice,
Yeah, that feels good,
I'm looking great,
Yeah, fer shure!
Like, no way!


""No Anchovies, Please""
J. Geils Band, LOVE STINKS

""No Anchovies, Please"" is a novelty song, really a narration with
sound effects, about a woman who is kidnapped after eating
anchovies. She is taken to a ""foreign-speaking"" country. The sound
effect of the foreign tongue seems reversed. When you do play it
in reverse, it becomes: ""It doesn't take a genius to know the
difference between chicken shit and chicken salad.""


""Darling Nikki""
Prince, PURPLE RAIN

""Darling Nikki,"" cited as porn rock before Congress, is about a
dominatrix in a hotel lobby masturbating with a magazine. In part,
the complaint was that the album cover (flowers, and Prince on a
motorcycle) wasn't explicit enough to warn kids of the suggestive
lyrics. Senator Paula Hawkins apparently was not aware of a
backward message hidden in ""Darling Nikki."" The last thirty-five
seconds of the song is gibberish. The music changes abruptly and
becomes a repeated glottal sound. Then a two-syllable sound is
repeated twice, something like ""heaven, heaven."" Unintelligible
speech follows. At the end is a sound reminiscent of rain or bacon
frying , and wind sounds.
     Played backward, the message becomes:

     Hello, how are you?
     I'm fine 'cause I know that the Lord is coming soon.
     Coming, coming soon.

     It is clearly Prince and the Revolution singing this. The
words are clear but the intonation is funny -- the linger on some
words. Perhaps this is to make the reversed message you hear
playing the record normally a little less conspicuous.
     This is a weird reversal of the supposed secret message
menace. Raunchy forward lyrics conceal a religious secret message.


""Judas Kiss""
Petra, MORE POWER TO YOU

Petra is an obscure group that sings religious songs to a rock
beat. As further proof that things have gone full circle, the
backward-masking controversy prompted Petra to include a wholesome
backward message on their MORE POWER TO YOU album. It is in the
transition between two songs, just before ""Judas Kiss."" Clearly
audible gibberish reverses to this (the husky voice a cross
between George Beverly Shea and Dee Snider): ""What are you looking
for the Devil for, when you ought to be looking for the Lord?""

AFL JoyceM Welcome to the Apple II Music & Sound chat - our discussion will
           be on NoiseTracker - the new FTA music program for the GS.  AFA
           Gene will be our host this evening...Gene, the floor is yours :)

AFA Gene   Hi all... well first I'd like to point out, if y'all aren't aware
           yet, that a spanking new version of NoiseTracker has recently
           been released (9 days ago) and is now available in our New Files
           library. It is version 0.5. I haven't played around with it much
           yet, but it's supposed to fix a lot of the little bugs in 0.3
           (the first version we had online).  NoiseTracker also includes
           the ability to directly import ""modules,"" a term used for a
           certain type of Amiga song file which has become popular among PC
           users using the SoundBlaster sound card.

           Now, via NT, these ""MOD"" files are accessible by the GS. We
           expect to see a lot of activity on this end as far as ports from
           the PC and Amiga go. Note that you should be able to go straight
           to the PC music forum and download any recently uploaded MOD
           songfiles (there was a bug in the first wide release of the PCAO
           software, however, so a bunch of files with dates between around
           March 1991 and September 1991 may not download properly. Note that
           to use these PC MOD files, you'll have to rename the downloaded
           file ""MOD.xxxxxx"" if you want it to show up automatically in NT's
           ""open"" dialog box. (On the PC, all MOD files are named
           ""xxxxxxxx.MOD"" instead.)   Also, if the files are packed with ZIP
           compression, you'll need a program from the Communications Forum
           called AGATE -- it's a terminal program that includes the ability
           to unpack ZIP files.

           Now, I guess the best thing to do would be to talk about our
           favorite songfiles... there have been a few complaints, in fact,
           that people were not being ""descriptive"" enough in their file
           descriptions for uploads in describing the songs.

AFC Eddie  ?

AFA Gene   GA ed

AFC Eddie  Once a MOD file is unpacked with Agate, is a file type change
           needed?

AFA Gene   Nope, since all that NT looks for is the ""MOD."" being the first
           four characters in the filename.

AFC Eddie  OK, Thanks!

Deanna7332 Question...

JonL7      Can you list some of the features of Noisetracker?

AFA Gene   (you don't even need that ""MOD."" if you want to type the name in
           directly.)

Deanna7332 Did any of these mod files have anything to do with FTA's ""Module
           A""

AFA Gene   Sure Jon, right after we answer Deanna's question. Deanna, you
           mean ""Modulae?""

Deanna7332 Yes, that's it.

AFA Gene   Modulae was a demo written by FTA last year. (i'll get to you in a
           sec Doors).  It used SoundSmith v0.95 for all it's music. There
           is no connection between MOD files and Modulae by FTA.

Deanna7332 Throughout the demo it said ""Loading modules""

AFA Gene   Those ""modules"" are not the same as Amiga soundfile ""modules"" --
           you see, what Modulae really was was a ""stringing together"" of a
           bunch of neat little tiny demos that FTA had written. So they
           called each little demo a ""module"" and thus the entire demo as a
           whole, ""Modulae"" (fancy plural of module?)

Deanna7332 Ok I understand.  Thank you. :)

AFL JoyceM Latin, Gene :)

AFA Gene   The term ""MODule"" from the Amiga comes from the idea that all the
           stuff needed to play the songfile (all the instruments + the
           sequence file) are included into one file, the ""module.""

TheDoors1  Gene, I have tried to d/l some recent uploaded MODs in the PC
           music area and still the problem exists.

AFA Gene   As I understand it, the problem was fixed VERY recently (correct
           me on this Joyce) and files uploaded as recently as early
           November still might not work depending on the version of the
           PCAO software that the uploader used.

AFL JoyceM Actually, Gene...I was under the impression that it had been, but
           if Doors is still having a problem, then it must not be fixed.

AFA Gene   What date was the file you tried to d/l, Door?

TheDoors1  umm 11/17, around there

AFA Gene   hmmm.... well i can tell you one thing... if it didn't work, don't
           waste your time again later... the problem is in the Apple
           software's method of d/lling files, and there are no plans to
           upgrade the Apple AO software.

AFL JoyceM I will endeavor to get an answer to that PC downloading
           problem/question :)

ThomasK63  i have a quick question... what can you use to unpack amiga mod
           files? On the PC side, that is.

TheDoors1  Agate Thomas

ELECTMUSIC Doors... what happens on after downloading..

Deanna7332 If it's LZHed you can't unless you have an IBM or
           PC/Transporter.

AFA Gene   If GS-ShrinkIt doesn't have that ability, i don't think there
           exists any such utility on the GS.

TheDoors1  What do you mean Elect?

ELECTMUSIC After you download the file... where do you encounter a problem?

TheDoors1  ok, you know when you download the file and at some point in the
           download the file starts to appear on your screen.  That's when I
           cancel it.

ThomasK63  I am sure soething good can be made w/out resorting to Amiga
           files

AFC Eddie  Yes, Doors, I believe the problem is with the PC software it was
           UL'd with.

TheDoors1  yeah Eddie.

GNO Tim    Amiga MOD files are typically compressed using LHarc.  I've
           uncompressed several on my Unix machine at school.

ThomasK63  good time for someone to make a lharc unpacker...

AFC DYAJim someone might be ;)

GNO Tim    Several people are already

AFC Eddie  Can't wait, Jim!

AFA Gene   Jon, did you have a question?

JonL7      The features of Noisetracker :)

AFA Gene   Oh yes... okay, here goes, in a nutshell, from most important to
           least:


AFA Gene   *  ability to import MOD files

           *  ability to import Soundsmith files

           *  ProDOS 8 based

           *  virtually no editing abilities (not a feature but important to
           know)

AFC DYAJim :)

AFA Gene   *  forgot: and the most important feature of all, the ability to
           hold instrument files in regular system RAM instead of DOC RAM,
           allowing for instruments far beyond the regular 64K limit found
           in ALL other GS music programs.

ThomasK63  I'll buy that!

TheDoors1  I have another question...when you're ready.

AFA Gene   GA Doors

TheDoors1  ok..is it true that NoiseTracker will take in soundsmith files and
           play them more clearly

AFA Gene   Well, as far as ""what you hear,"" yes there is a definite
           difference with some instruments. It does NOT play the sounds
           more ""clearly,"" but it just plays them in a different way. What
           many people seem to like about this ""different way"" is that
           sustained instruments (i.e. instruments designed to be played
           in a loop to simulate a long held note) seem to work better (or
           perhaps simply the way they were originally intended to work).

TheDoors1  I see

Deanna7332 Which takes up more space - MOD or NT  w/soundfile ?

AFA Gene   Deanna, it depends a few things, such as how big the sequence is,
           how many instruments you have, etc. Once you have a lot of
           assorted files, it'll probably average out to be about the same
           give or take a hundred blocks on your HD. So it basically depends
           on whether you prefer to have your instruments separate or not.

Deanna7332 Does playing quality differ with either one ?

AFA Gene   Nope. It's exactly the same either way. Loading time is the same
           too.

AFC Eddie  Can NT save songs as MOD files?

AFA Gene   Nope. It has options for Open and Close module, but these are
           still inactive.

AFA Gene   If there are no more questions, I'd like to talk about which NT
           files out there are the ""hottest,"" since this info could be
           useful to many users who are interested in downloading NT/MOD
           files.

           My personal favorite is ""Lambada,"" which is supplied by FTA with
           the program but is available separately on America
           Online.Everything about this file is really impressive except
           perhaps the sound quality of the horn-ish melody instrument.

           What about y'all, what are your favorite NT files?

AFL JoyceM Gene, there is a classical song for NT, but can't remember the
           name, but it is good.

AFC Eddie  I like Dragnet!

ELECTMUSIC So do I Ed

TheDoors1  I like Seven something

Deanna7332 My most favorite of all mod files is Pleasure Principle

AFC Eddie  <--appreciate's Greg's taste!

AFL JoyceM :)

AFA Gene   Deanna, i assume you got that from a local board?

Deanna7332 I got it from the PC forum here.

TheDoors1  I saw it there also

Deanna7332 I think under ""Pleasure""

AFA Gene   Would you be able to upload it here? If it's really that good, we
           ought to have it available directly in our oun NT lib here (BTW
           folks, we will be releasing a new NoiseTracker software library
           soon!)

AFC Eddie  What a Forum!!!

Deanna7332 That sounds great!

AFL JoyceM Gene, do you think it will be possible for synthLAB files to be
           converted to MOD files?

AFL JoyceM MOD files?

AFA Gene   I doubt it, Joyce. The formats are so diametrically opposed in
           their entire basis of their file formats that it wouldn't be
           worth the time for a programmer to develop such a convertor.

Deanna7332 Isn't it possible to move the mod file from the PC forum to our
           music library?

AFA Gene   But..... it might be worth the time for a MIDI File Format to MOD
           convertor, since these two formats are more widely accepted.

Nuzz       they have nothing better to do Gene

ELECTMUSIC Gene.. some interesting similarities with DTune and NTracker

AFA Gene   They lose the file, tho, Deanna. :)

AFL JoyceM In what way, Greg?

ELECTMUSIC Both Prodos 8

Deanna7332 Shhh they won't know a thing :)

ELECTMUSIC I also believe Bill uses a shuttling of sound data between Doc
           Ram and Ram.

AFC Eddie  Interesting, Greg.

ELECTMUSIC Thats how he gets some of the excellent instrument quality

AFC Eddie  But Diversitune has that one distinction:  MIDI input.

AFL JoyceM Deanna, we would greatly appreciate it if you would upload that
           'Pleasure' song to our library :)

ELECTMUSIC Agreed Ed.. one of the factors FTA doesn't like to incorporate
           into their programs.

Deanna7332 I'll u/l it tonight if possible.

AFL JoyceM Thanks :)

AFC Eddie  Thanks, Deanna!

AFL JoyceM I will send Bill B a copy of NoiseTracker + some MOD files...to
           see what comments we get from him (will send when I get back).

AFC DYAJim What ever happened to that diversitune upgrade that was talked
           about ?

ELECTMUSIC That would be interesting Joyce

AFC Eddie  Bill apparently still working on it, Jim.

ELECTMUSIC I am sure he would appreciate the Prodos 8

AFC DYAJim good..

AFL JoyceM Jim...RSN....he was hoping by Christmas (this year), but he is
           soooo busy with his job, who knows?

AFC DYAJim Oh yeah, I noticed the speed calcuation in NT .5 is inaccurate
           :)

AFC DYAJim I recall he has set a lot of Christmas projected dates :)

ELECTMUSIC He was one of the first ""Free Tools"" experts in breaking all the
           rules for economic sake.

AFC DYAJim like for the vaporware DT inst editor like 2 years ago.

Deanna7332 Are there any Christmas Mod or NT songs?

AFC Eddie  Oh yeah, Diversi-Editor!

AFL JoyceM I know, Jim - but that I know he has been working on.

AFC DYAJim he projected Christmas for it, and it never came :)

AFA Gene   Not yet in AMS, but hopefully the Holiday Contest will change all
           that. :)

AFC DYAJim I look foreward to any upgrades..

AFL JoyceM Not that I am aware of Deanna - you have some?  hint, hint

Deanna7332 Nope sorry.  I was hoping there were some that could be u/led
           here

AFC DYAJim I'll be breaking out the xmas tune book rsn.. I should be able to
           midi a few :) (which rules out nt)

AFL JoyceM Question...

AFC Eddie  It would be more appropriate to have a converter from Appleworks
           spreadsheet to MOD than from MIDI!

AFL JoyceM If I got ahold of an Amiga song (MOD) disk...how would I convert
           them for here?

AFA Gene   You mean an Amiga-formatted disk?

AFL JoyceM Yes

AFC DYAJim Ack.. methinks you need an amiga and a null modem cable or a
           modem.

AFA Gene   Methinks Jim is right

AFC DYAJim LOL!!  Design your music in the spreadsheet then import to NT :)
           IT might actually have better editing?!! :)

AFC Eddie  Right!

AFL JoyceM Me thinks he is right.  If I had them upload to me, would that
           work?

AFA Gene   Yep; should work like a charm.

AFC DYAJim Yah.. as long as they're coming from an amiga

AFL JoyceM Great....I will work on that when I get back  (making note now).

AFL JoyceM Gene, will you get some of those files (NT) sent to that area
           tonight?  If so, I will leave the needed message :)

AFA Gene   That's all I have planned for tonight's chat, Joyce. Yep, I'll
           move some files right now.

AFL JoyceM Thanks...

AFL JoyceM Then we should have our NoiseTracker Library by end of the week in
           AMS :)

ELECTMUSIC Gene... quick question:  Are you launching NTracker from a 3.5
           disk?

AFL JoyceM Okay, guys...I will see you all the week of December 11th (may the
           4th) as I am off on vacation.

AFA Gene   Yep greg

AFC JohnC  Where are you going?

ELECTMUSIC Do you encounter out of memory problems

AFL JoyceM Night all...and Gene, thanks for an excellent chat and great
           explanations of NoiseTracker.

Nuzz       Joyce, I have good news for FutureSound owners. SoundConvert will
           support it in the first release

AFC Eddie  Great, Mike!

AFA Gene   Greg, i always keep my RAMdisk at 0 when using noisetracker. Not
           only are

AFC JohnC  Mike...SoundConvert...released?

AFL JoyceM Great, Mike.  When can we get SoundConvert, Mike? and FutureSound
           :)

AFA Gene   there a couple of bugs with memory management, but if you're
           loading in a MOD file that's really big, NT will eat your RAMdisk.

AFC Eddie  Sounds good.

Nuzz       The manual is being ""layout"". Release date should be about 1st
           week of Dec

ELECTMUSIC Tnxs Gene

AFC JohnC  YES.......WTG Nuzz!!!!!!!!

Deanna7332 Yes, why is there on some MOD files a stop somewhere in the middle
           ?

Deanna7332 That's really frustrating!

AFL JoyceM Mike, leave me E-Mail on when and how I can send your the $$ to
           get it.

AFL JoyceM Again...night all

Nuzz       gee John, I had to do something to explain the delay :)

ELECTMUSIC Thanks Gene for a GREAT chat!

AFC Eddie  Yes, Gene!  Great!

AFA Gene   Thanks Greg, 'night!

AFA Gene   thanx, see y'all later :)

Copyright 1987 Bob Szekely.

    John Michael Osbourne, (known as ""Ozzy"" to his fans), has in his long 
career as vocalist for Black Sabbath had his work with the group misconstrued 
as advocating Satanism.  In a 1983 radio special featuring Ozzy, the 
interviewer expressed precisely this point; ""...Ozzy has always been shrouded 
in the darkest of Satanic imagery.  Yet if you really listen to his music, 
you'll find that what he is saying differs greatly from his image....""(1)  Even 
the group's image has often been described as ""occult and diabolic"".(2)

    The important point to remember here is to differentiate between appearance 
and reality.  Although the name ""Black Sabbath"" conjures up images of witches 
and sorcerers paying homage to Satan for the powers bestowed upon them, this 
does not make it safe to assume that the group that went by this name 
necessarily drew the inspiration from the occult.(3)  The closest they ever 
came to it was a gothic horror film featuring Boris Karloff as narrator; they 
adopted their name directly from the name of this film.(4)  Black Sabbath was 
involved in the black arts as much as Karloff practiced casting spells off-
screen.  Tony Iommi, the group's guitarist, summed it up best when he described 
the group as having basically ""...the same appeal as a horror movie.  It's all 
an act.""(5)










    Just as their film counterpart did, Ozzy and Sabbath found the occult 
mythos to be an effective vehicle for powerful social commentary; particularly 
when put in the context of heavy-metal rock and roll.  Ozzy himself noted that 
there are ""...people who pick up my [album] cover[s] and go...'This guy's got 
to be singing about Devil, doom, death and destruction.'  Which is not the 
case....""(6)

    The late Lester Bangs likened the group to Bob Dylan and William Burroughs, 
describing them all as ""...moralists...trying to deal with a serious present 
situation in an honest way....""(7)  Ozzy and Black Sabbath merely bring to 
light the many evils of our world in their work, to try and make us realize 
that we are all victim to their influence.  They hope to make us recognize 
these evils so that we may take up arms against them; a point Ozzy emphatically 
stresses:  ""...one thing everybody has got to understand about Black Sabbath's 
lyrics.  They're not downer lyrics, they're just telling everybody where it's 
at...""(8)  He also cites the group's most controversial tune, ""Black Sabbath"", 
as a response to the ignorant hippie culture still force when the tune was 
written in 1970:  ""The hippies said: 'The world is beautiful man.' (sic)  You 
only had to look around you to see how crappy it was.  It was ridiculous 
listening to that stuff, let alone playing it, so we just wrote about the world 
the way it really was and how it affected us - and we felt better in ourselves 
because we were really being honest....""(9)

        5   IS GOD JUST A THOUGHT WITHIN YOUR HEAD OR IS
        6   HE A PART OF YOU?

        32  SAY YOU DON'T BELIEVE?
        33  YOU HAD THE CHANCE BUT YOU TURNED IT DOWN
        34  NOW YOU CAN'T RETRIEVE.










    VI  35  PERHAPS YOU'LL THINK BEFORE YOU SAY THAT
        36  GOD IS DEAD AND GONE
        37  OPEN YOUR EYES, JUST REALIZE THAT HE IS THE
        38  ONE.
        39  THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN SAVE YOU KNOW FROM
        40  ALL THIS SIN AND HATE.
        41  OR WILL YOU STILL JEER AT ALL YOU HEAR?
        42  YES!-I THINK IT'S TOO LATE.

    In this piece, the group asserts a belief in an afterlife and spiritual 
redemption.  As grisly as the image of a hanged pontiff is, its shock value is 
a necessary part of the message:  They reject religious dogma, stating that a 
belief in God, in one's own heart, is the only guiding light to help one inn 
his life (lines 11/12, 39/40).  Furthermore, the reject religious hypocrisy 
(lines 5/6, 7/8) and peer pressure (verses III, IV) as excuses for not 
accepting God.  To clarify further:  following the crowd does not justify 
shrugging responsibility for one's own actions.

    After re-reading, it becomes obvious that this song is an ascerbic critique 
of atheism; (line 35/36) I refer here again to verses three and four.  In these 
two verses, the picture painted in one of Godless conformity and how it's 
viewed as being as foolish as Paganism.  These lyrics set an example for the 
listener by relating personal experience (lines 13-16).  However, for those who 
cannot accept this the group has no recourse but to condemn them, although 
rather ironically; they hope that their rhetorical loss of faith in the 
listener will open his eyes (line 42).

walls of flame, figure in black, and damnation at the end.  Yes, I see the 
images too; it definitely concerns Black Magic.  Then again, Shakespeare's 
Macbeth employed scenes of witches involved in conjurations; does that mean 
that Shakespeare was a warlock?  Poe used to write sardonic tragedies about 
twisted murderers and the bizarre nature of acts, did that make him an evil, 
leering, demented killer?  Did either of them advocated what they wrote about?  
One has to remember that writing about something is not necessarily the same as 
emulating it.  Tony Iommi spoke out quite strongly about this:  ""People are 
bringing us down saying that we are a Black Magic group.  I think they must be










getting mixed up with Black Widow.  We don't do any sacrifices on stage, and 
we're not on a black magic kick.  We wanted to do heavy numbers and the guitar 
riffs we worked out were more suited to evil things than love.  We play songs 
about black magic, but they are more likely to be against than for it.""(12)  

    By now, you're probably asking yourself who Black Widow is, right?  Then 
it's time for a little history:

        Sabbath, before they were known as Sabbath, had the same line-up but 
two earlier names.  The first one was Polka Tulk, which seemed sure to doom 
them to obscurity.(13)  The soon realized this and changed the group's name to 
Earth.  Now, Earth was a blues band at the end of the English blues boom.  As 
if that wasn't bad enough, they soon discovered that not only was there another 
group named Earth, but they had also released a single.  To avoid confusion, 
they changed their name again.(14)  But what made them decide on that name?  
Just ask Ozzy:  ""I just liked the name Black Sabbath because of the succession 
of vowel sounds.(15)  If that sounds ludicrous just consider this:  Sabbath was 
""...the first of the really committed, loud and heavy bands...""(16)  They 
needed a name to match the gut-wrenching power they were developing.  Tony knew 
that he wanted Sabbath to be noticed above all the rest of the British blues 
bands:  ""We wanted something of our own that we'd like and people would like.  
And we wanted something loud!""










    Tony didn't hate the blues.  He'd cut his teeth as a guitarist on the likes 
of The Shadows, Buddy Holly and Django Rheinhardt, developing his own style 
from there.  But he realized the group had no future in the blues:

        'We couldn't keep playing 12-bars forever.  We just got fed up with 
Earth music.  It was jazz, blues stuff.  It was good for practice but nothing 
else.'

    In the late 'Sixties, blues groups were a dime a dozen in Birmingham and 
interest was waning in the blues boom due to the glut of groups.  One man, by 
the name of Jim Simpson, had heard Earth around the Birmingham club circuit and 
understood what they were trying to do.  He decided to take them under his 
wing.  With the aid of his massive record collection, Jim expanded the group's 
horizons in the areas of jazz and blues.  He introduced them to artists like 
Wes Montgomery, Count Basie and Jimmy Rushing.  It was from Rushing in 
particular that they derived the repetitive riff style so readily noticeable in 
their later incarnation as Black Sabbath.

    The Count Basie influence is evidenced in the song ""Wicked World"" from the 
first album; Sabbath drummer Bill Ward uses a ""'sighing hi-hat'...in the manner 
of Basie's drummer Jo Jones.""










    The influence is subtle, almost subliminal.  Yet it is one which was not 
thought capable of hard, 'heavy' rock bands in the late 'Sixties.  Although Led 
Zeppelin and Jimi Hendrix also had their work steeped in blues and jazz 
derivations (Hendrix' ""Third Stone From the Sun"" and Zeppelin's version of 
Willie Dixon's ""I Can't Quit You Baby"" from their first album), neither was 
able to match the intense energy of Black Sabbath.  Iommi has always had a 
preference for music with an original, distinct style of its' own; as an 
example, he mentions guitarists Joe Pass and Alvin Lee as two of his strongest 
songwriting influences.

    It would also be necessary that Sabbath develop a unique, distinctive style 
and image of their own.  Though they had changed their name from Earth to Black 
Sabbath to avoid confusion with the other Earth; at the same time another group 
emerged by the name of Black Widow ""...who WERE profoundly influenced by the 
occult, had a male witch as a patron, and wrote pieces like ""Come to The 
Sabbat.""  Unfortunately, Sabbath was constantly reaping the benefits of Widow's 
publicity.

    Sabbath was a group that never minced words.  If they saw something as 
destructive, they would be sure to rub the listener's face it it.  They did not 
want their point to be missed.

    With their straightforward, sometimes brutal way of looking at things, they 
try to shock the listener's conscience back into awareness.  The imagery of 
""Hand of Doom"", from the Paranoid album, is candid and condemning; it is a 
strong statement against drug addiction and rightly so...

    Many people felt the group's overall direction was pessimistic and had a 
negative effect on its listener's due to that.  ""Ozzy insisted that if people 
thought he was having a bad effect on the minds of young kids, they should go 
and watch the TV news where real murder and mayhem were a way of life, and 
shown night after night."" (18)

    Sabbath was never negative in their message; they were simply truthful 
about waht they saw as wrong in the world.  If you ""Strip away the horror 
stories, the imagery and the hysteria, (and) turn down the amps a notch...you 
have a well-rehearsed, solid blues and rock band, powered by a dedication to 
well defined objectives.""  On the top of the list of those objectives was 
truth; Sabbath never feared facing that truth squarely, regardless of what many 
people thought of them.

Long, long, time ago,
I can still remember,
When the local calls were ""free"".
And I knew if I paid my bill,
And never wished them any ill,
That the phone company would let me be...

But Uncle Sam said he knew better,
Split 'em up, for all and ever!
We'll foster competition:
It's good capital-ism!

I can't remember if I cried,
When my phone bill first tripled in size.
But something touched me deep inside,
The day... Bell System... died.

And we were singing...

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

Is your office Step by Step,
Or have you gotten some Crossbar yet?
Everybody used to ask...
Oh, is TSPS coming soon?
IDDD will be a boon!
And, I hope to get a Touch-Tone phone, real soon...

The color phones are really neat,
And direct dialing can't be beat!
My area code is ""low"":
The prestige way to go!

Oh, they just raised phone booths to a dime!
Well, I suppose it's about time.
I remember how the payphones chimed,
The day... Bell System... died.

And we were singing...

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

Back then we were all at one rate,
Phone installs didn't cause debate,
About who'd put which wire where...
Installers came right out to you,
No ""phone stores"" with their ballyhoo,
And 411 was free, seemed very fair!

But FCC wanted it seems,
To let others skim long-distance creams,
No matter 'bout the locals,
They're mostly all just yokels!

And so one day it came to pass,
That the great Bell System did collapse,
In rubble now, we all do mass,
The day... Bell System... died.

So bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

I drove on out to Murray Hill,
To see Bell Labs, some time to kill,
But the sign there said the Labs were gone.
I went back to my old CO,
Where I'd had my phone lines, years ago,
But it was empty, dark, and ever so forlorn...

No relays pulsed,
No data crooned,
No MF tones did play their tunes,
There wasn't a word spoken,
All carrier paths were broken...

And so that's how it all occurred,
Microwave horns just nests for birds,
Everything became so absurd,
The day... Bell System... died.

So bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

We were singing:

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?

And that's good enough for me!    And it's good enough for me! 

There are some that call it folly     Shall we sing a verse for Thor,
When we worship Mother Kali.          Though he leaves the maidens sore?

But she's good enough for me.         So he's good enough for me!

Shall we sing in praise of Loki,      It was good enough for Odin
Though he left poor Midgard smokey?   Though the tremblin' got forbodin'
Oh, his sense of humor's hokey,       Then the giants finally strode in,
But he's good enough for me.          But it's good enough for me.

   As a War-Puppy he was insane,
   Gave up Tranya for Imperium Compound,
   Now we have an Acid Reign!            //Oh wow, man!//   (18)

   This song'll bedevil the folks at a revel,
   And most of the time it will annoy the King,
   So take a drink of Imperium Compound
   And let's go Royalty-bedeviling!                         (5)

   Duchess Anna is quite a fan-a
   Going on a wartime shopping spree!  \\ War Point!\\
   Took a drink of Imperium Compound
   And shopped so fast we couldn't see! \\ Z-o-o-o-om!\\    (5)

   Lyn of Whitewolfe, made of the right stuff,
   Twice the Queen of Atenveldt;
   Took a drink of Imperium Compound
   And the Kingdom of Caid before her knelt!                (5)

   Duke Sir Brion, and Duke Sir Trelon,
   Won the Crown with regularity;
   Drank a lot of Imperium Compound,
   And founded a dynasty!                                   (5)

   Stephan von Geist, was most awful nice,
   And a chivalrous fighter without any doubt
   Took a swig of Imperium Compound
   And won the Crown his first time out!                    (5)

   All the Crusadenes were big, but not mean,
   And the finest fighters in the town.
   But they all drank Jerusalem Compound,
   Winning Crown after Crown after Crown!                   (5)

   Good Duke Arthur couldn't get no farth-er
   A Norman King in Aten Land
   Drank too much of Imperium Compound
   And went off to conquer Engel-land!                      (5)

   Then King Richard, a bit of a bitch, heard
   A King's Crown could be done.
   Drank a little Imperium Compound
   And became the Aten King, first one!                     (5)
11
   There was Astra, no one ever asked her
   And she was for having fun!
   Then she sampled Imperium Compound,
   And today she is a nun   \\ not better!\\               (19)

   There's good old Igor, his prowess is meager
   For he never learned to water-ski!
   But instead he drinks Imperium Compound
   Then he howls and climbs a tree!  \\Hoo Hah!\\          (19)

   Then there's Dagan, his brother's the Ka-Khan,
   Which is quite funny in a King!
   If he gets hooked on Imperium Compound
   There'll be new songs to sing!    \\ Oh, really?\\       (19)  

   Fredrick of Holland, who dwells in the Northland,
   A Master from the West, he came!
   Spends all his money for Imperium Compound
   That's why his garb's always the same!                   (20)

   Now Gyrth Oldcastle, round as a beer barrel,
   Once chose to quarrel with a certain Bard;
   The poet served him with Imperium Compound,
   And left him rendered down to lard!                      (20)

   Many tales abound of Imperium Compound
   And its' strange effects on Royalty,
   But after an hour, this song has no power,
   And by now, it's boring ME!                             (16)

   Duchess Malinda, who doesn't do windas
   But she does a lot of Duchess Things,
   But give her a LOT of Imperium Compound,
   And she sings and sings and sings and sings and sings!   (5)

   AltChorus: Oh it's too long, too long, too long
              To sing the whole song, the song, the song
              Longer than a Royal Court, it is!
              But sing it serial, this ditty Imperial
              And you'll be a bardic whiz!                 (5)

                                             IMPERIUM COMPOUND    
                                             (Atenveldt Verses)

   Now here's a story, a little bit gory,
   A little bit happy, a little bit sad.
   About a drink called Imperium Compound
   And how the SCA's been had!                       

   Chorus: Oh we think, we think, we think,
           The King is a fink, a fink, a fink,
           A figure of respectability
           Rules the Kingdom thru Imperium Compound
           The results are plain to see!

   Mongol Hordemen, those free-living swordsmen
   Subverting the Kingdoms from underneath!
   Have no use for Imperium Compound
   Except perhaps to brush their teeth!

   AltChorus: Oh we fink, we fink, we fink,
              The Khan and the Kink, the Kink, the Kink,
              And the Board, their Great Senilities!
              The Western Irgun, drinks Imperium Compound
              And we're BACK, with results you'll see!    

   Lady Laurel, with Authority Royal,
   Passes and rejects our heraldry
   She needs a swig of Imperium Compound
   Then perhaps she'd deign to talk to me!            

   Lady Trude thought it her duty
   To turn a social wrong into a Right
   Proved her point with Imperium Compound
   And showed that Cheshire Cats can fight!  //and scratch//

   The Board of Directors styled themselves The Electors
   And another con they tried to swing
   Now the BoD drinks Imperium Compound
   So we no longer need a King!                        

   AltChorus: Oh the Bod, the BoD, the BoD,
              It thinks it is God, is God, is God,
              The figure of Supreme Authority!
              And if we O.D.'d on Imperium Compund
              there'd be no need for Royalty!          

   Oh, MEDIEVAL Net, we thought it was all wet
   With witty remarks, and other kinds of sass
   We'll feed our computers on Imperium Compound
   And BYTE the BoD right on its' righteous ass!         

   Good old Duncan was often drunken
   Chasing all the ladies fair
   He bathed himself in Imperium Compound
   Now he has a little savoir faire!                     

                    (more)


  ATEN IMPERIUM (cont.)

   Ioseph of Locksley, never changes his socks, he
   Runs around looking like a Cavalier,
   He stocked up on Imperium Compound
   And he has enough to last for years and years!        

   AltChorus: Oh they forgot, forgot, forgot
              The Locks-e-ly Plot, the Plot, the Plot!
              And it works the best when it is underground!
              It isn't a hassle for a green-and-white tassle
              They're the ones that BREW Imperium Compound!  

   Trelon of the Wood, he was very good, he
   Was a leader that had never been beat before;
   But Caid had Imperium Compound,
   And Imperial Roman Caid won the War!  //with help!//   

   In Tyr Ysgithr, it's regularly whispered there
   That the Kingdom is ruled over by a King    // What's THAT? //
   They're ""democratic"" and quite erratic....
   They've forgot the purpose of the whole damn thing!     

   King Sir Mark von, with his pretty white suit on,
   Rules the Kingdom both with Grace and Purity!
   He never touches Imperium Compound
   At least not where anyone else can see!               

   Duke Sir Deaton, was never beaten
   On the field, or in the drinking hall;
   At the Catbox War with Caid,
   Left thirty bodies piled against the wall!             

   Denis O'Titans was good at smitin'
   A Locksley Monster in every single way!
   Drank a little Imperium Compound
   And ATE Deaton's sword that day  // No! REALLY! //       

   Wotan the Mongoloid, a little bit paranoid,
   But a nice guy none the less;
   Drank a mess of Imperium Compound
   Now he's Justin du Roc, I confess!                       

   Then there's Duke Reynard, with a face like a St. Bernard
   Of the Dukes, he is the homliest
   He tends to toke up on Imperium Compound
   And go out and whomp on anybody's best!                   

   This song'll bedevil the folks at a revel,
   And most of the time it will annoy the King,
   So take a drink of Imperium Compound
   And let's go Royalty-bedeviling!                        

   Duchess Anna is quite a fan-a
   Going on a wartime shopping spree!  \\ War Point!\\
   Took a drink of Imperium Compound
   And shopped so fast we couldn't see! \\ Z-o-o-o-om!\\    (5)

   Duke Sir Brion, with his pretty white suit on,
   Is a model of goodness and purity
   Never touches Imperium Compound
(spoken:) And I'll sell ya seashore property in Yuma, too!  

   Optional last verse:

   Many tales abound of Imperium Compound
   And its' strange effects on Royalty,
   But after an hour, this song has no power,
   And by now, it's boring ME!

                copyright 1984 W. J. Bethancourt III
                recorded: CELTIC CIRCLE DANCE
                          WTP-0002C

        Last night I had the strangest dream in this bleak century
        I dreamed that people the world around believed in Chivalry

        I dreamed I saw a Kingly Crown enshrined in laurel leaves
        with Grace and Joy and Purity attendant at his feet

        I dreamed I saw the perfect Knight receive his accolade
        and minstrels sang and children laughed in some soft forest glade

        I dreamed I saw the finest thing that ever man could make
        grow great and strong and undefiled: Pray God I never wake!

        Last night I had the strangest dream in this bleak century
        I dreamed that people the world around believed in Chivalry

               (to the tune of ""Good King Wenceslaus"")

                Locksley Monsters never yield
                on the field of battle
                strike the helm and bash the shield
                make their eyeteeth rattle
                Bodies on the ground will lie
                bones will burst in sunder
                search for Locksleys' enemies:
                You'll find them six feet under!

                              SONG OF IVANOF

            There is a man who we know well that does the best he can
            but he's displayed in armour made of reticulated garbage cans!

            He looks so fine and fair and strong, oh how he plays the man
            and how it's prized, those galvanized, reticulated garbage cans

            The noblest Roman of them all, a good Praetorian
            a combatant who wears no pants, judst reticulated garbage cans!

            Like old Horatius at the Bridge, like the Legions of Valerian
            (O dearie me: those LOVELY knees!)
            and those reticulated garbage cans!

                         C. McCray Bethancourt

         (sung to the tune (obviously) of the 12 Days of Christmas)


1.           The first time I sent my device, The Heralds said to me

            ""It violates the Rule of Three""

2.           The next time I tried it, the Heralds said to me

            ""We changed the forms, and it violates the Rule of
             Three"".

3.           The third time I tried, and the Heralds said to me, 

            ""We upped the fees, we changed the forms, and it
             violates the Rule of Three"".

4.           Another time I tried and the Heralds said to me,
 
            ""We haven't got it, we upped the fees, we changed the 
             forms, and it violates the Rule of Three"".

5.           The fifth time I tried it, the Heralds said to me,  

            ""In a decision rendered by the College of Arms on
             August 1st, A.S. V it was decided that this style of
             heraldic design was not appropriate to the aims and 
             intentions of the Corporate Body. Holy! Holy! Holy! ""

 note: verse 5 is delivered in an extremely fast, mono-
       tone, similiar to a Gregorian Chant.

           "" ....we haven't got it, we upped the fees, we changed the forms,
             and it violates the Rule of Three.""

6.           I tried it a sixth time, and the Heralds said to me,

            ""We changed the rules, &c""

7.           A seventh time I tried and, the Heralds said to me,

            ""It's against the Rule of Tincture, we changed the
             rules, &c""

8.           I tried it once again and the heralds said to me,

            ""It's not a Period design, It's against the Rule of Tincture, We
             changed the rules, &c""

                                * more *



    Heralds Said To Me (cont.)

9.           I sent it in once more, and the Heralds said to me,

            ""We changed the rules again, It's not a Period design,
             it's against the Rule of Tincture, we changed the
             rules, &c""

10. (sung in cold anger)
             The LAST time I sent my device, the Heralds said to me

    (sung in a state of SMUG)
             ""Someone else has got it, &c""




              (nb: every single one of these reasons has been used by the
              CoA, at one point or another, to reject perfectly good
              heraldry, along with some even MORE stupid.  If the shoe 
              fits....................!!!!!!!!)

                        BUGS ON THE BARONESS
                        Tune: Waltzing Matilda
 
           or: Who was that Vermin I saw you with last, Knight?
   or: There may be Lice on all you Knice, but there ain't no Lice on me

           Once there was a Barony howling in the wilderness
           nestled in the Valley where the River doesn't flow
           and the folks were driven buggy by the insects in the Revel Hall
           Authenticity is wonderful, but this doesn't go!

                   Bugs on the Baroness, bugs on the Baroness!
                   That was the cry that you heard all the day
                   and the scratching can be heard from Ysgithr to Ered Sul
                   why did we come here? Let's go away!

           See them all a scratching, nestled in their armour tight
           the fleas have a melee team that's challenging the field!
           call Truly Nolen! Someone's gotta help us out!
           the crabs are nesting in our helms but we'll never yield!

                   (chorus)

           Dawn comes a-breaking, the bugs have won the Coronet...
           flea-infested Conan-clones in piles upon the lawn
           where is the Barony? The bugs have eaten everyone...
           termites got the stick-jocks, and all their sticks are gone!

                   (chorus)

                          ATENVELDT
                          tune: The West's Awake

                  For all the Lands where I have dwelt
                  Oh Atenveldt, Oh Atenveldt
                  till rivers burn and mountains melt
                  lest I forget my Atenveldt
                  From deserts stark to snow-capped peaks
                  from silent lakes and laughing creeks
                  sing: Oh let man find his heart's ease
                  on rocky plains
                  in desert breeze

                  For oft I thought of mighty men
                  who carved a Land with sword and pen
                  and lit a candle, burning bright,
                  that pierced the darkness; stirred the night!
                  tho some are gone their deeds remain
                  this sunny Crown without a stain
                  sing: Oh, their deeds were not in vain!
                  in sunlit days
                  and falling rain.....

                  So raise your banners, blazoned bright
                  Advance the Dream and Shine the Light!
                  in battle's crash and Revel's song
                  raise high the Flag and wave it long!
                  For all the Lands wherein I've dwelt
                  I love you best, my Atenveldt!
                  Sing: Oh the Joy that I have felt!
                  My Atenveldt

      What the use of wearing panties
      whalebone corsets of your Auntie's
      boxer shorts and other scanties
      best of all is nude
      there's such fun in going bra-less
      now that it's no longer lawless
      'specially if your figure's flawless
      best of all is nude
      nude is what you're born in
      shirts are never torn in
      underwear and lacy flimsies, garter belts and other whimsies
      yards of itchy cloth to put your form in
      ducks all do it, maidens rue it
      even ancient Picts in Britain blue it
      going naked's how to do it
      best of all is nude!

      If your garters aren't elastic
      tie them up in knots fantastic
      (panty hose is something drastic!)
      best of all is nude!
      If you're tired of wearing clotheses
      shed your garment 'mongst the roses
      never mind the old bluenoses
      best of all is nude!
      Nude is best for ducking!
      Worst for horses bucking!
      Moonlit nights will see such sights
          that are very best for fooling round
                              .....and elbows!
      Nudity is grand to see
       a well-known antidote to virginity
      take your clothes off and you'll see:
      best of all is nude!

                   once I talked to a great Grey Man
                   spun three times and said with a sigh
                   hadn't been for the Runes had his other eye!

                   prettiest thing I've ever seen
                   she went down underneath the hill
                   and came back out of her own free will

                   Brian Boru, on Irish ground
                   walked three times the Island round
                   Norsemen came lookin for a fight
                   just another Irish Saturday night!

                   Hi said Lugh on the banquest night

                   a harper and a warrior and none the least:
                   a Druid and he got in to the Feast!

                   Harold Haardrada's face was red!
                   Came to Britain and he wound up dead
                   Stamford Bridge is where he's found
                   got six feet of English ground

                   the Legion with it's Eagles bright
                   marched into the Pictish night
                   met them there upon the sand
                   gave em up to the Wicker Man!

                   eight-legged steed and hound of Hel
                   the one-eyed Man, he loves ya well

                   are you then feared of the dark?

                   The Circle forms, the Circle flows
                   the Circle goes where no man knows
                   Hail to the Lady, one in three:
                   Present is Past and Past is Me!

                   Rhiannon's Birds are still in flight

                   Hi said the Lady dressed in white
                   sang the Day and sang the Night
                   sang the Land and sang the Sea
                   sang the Song, and then sang Me!

                                  came the Lady to the lea
                                  Sword and Roses in Her Hand
                                  spread their seeds thruout the Land

                                  Came the Stag from oaken wood
                                  saw the Lady where she stood
                                  by the fire burning bright
                                  came to know his heart's delight!

                    WEAPONS AT THE DOOR

 Being a Polemic concerning the alleged Custom of the West Kingdom concerning 
 checking your Weapons at the Door of the Revel Hall. As the Satire is the 
 Weapon of the Bard, this said Polemic is to be checked at the Door, along with 
 swords, knives, redheaded Ladies and other such Deadly Things.....

         As I roved out to Western Lands to take the Western Air
         I went into a Revel Hall and I saw a Twelfth Night there
         but I was halted at the gate by a Privy Consellor
                 (that's the man who tells the King of the West how to go to
                  the bath room!)
         who told me I would have to check my Weapons at the door

         As I, in my astonishment, stood hung on tenter-pegs
         a Knight came in whose Prouess hung down between his legs
         the Doorman grabbed a greatsword and he struck the Knight full sore
         and gave him a reciept; he left his weapon at the door!

         a Bard was next whose goodly Voice has entertained us all
         but he, too, was prevented from entering the Hall
         and told he could not carry deadly weapons on the floor
         he left his Voice and Harp among the weapons at the door

         a Master entered graciously, a man we all know well
         who holds a 3rd Dan Black Belt, tho this he'd never tell
         the Master struggled valiantly, the Master cursed and swore
         but he left his hands, and feet, as weapons at the door

         the company was jovial, altho a bit dismayed
         for lack of proper cutlery, down to the smallest blade
         for even teeth and fingernails, each can be used in War
         were cut, and pulled, and left behind, as weapons at the door!

         And has their King not loyal Knights that He must be afraid
         of brawling in his Hall and of Assassin's bloody blade?
         the Rights of Men to carry Arms at least WE'VE not foreswore
         and a POX on them that made the Rule of Weapons at the Door!

                           THE STREETS OF ANN ARBOR

               As I walked out thru the streets of Ann Arbor
               as I walked out thru Ann Arbor one day
               I spied a young Mongol all dressed in white linen
               all dressed in white linen and cold as the clay

               I then spied another, done in on the sidewalk
               along with just about six dozen more
               their wounds were all gaping, from mace and from braoadsword
               from claymore and cannon, all dripping with gore

               what caused this grave carnage, I cried to the Monglos
               oh pray what's the reason for this awful sight
               my answer came slowly from under the corpse-pile
               ""It seems that our bark is much worse than our bite.....""

               the answer continued from pale lips a-shaking
               we sang all our songs and believed them as true
               the Dark Horde could never be beaten in battle
               we thought this was what all good Mongols could do...

               we went down to Atenveldt all for to plunder
               ""too large to defend"" was our song every night
               but Atenveldt's different from East, West or Middle
               there, even the bushes have learned how to bite!

               the Clann stole our ponies, the Scraelings our foodstuffs
               we ran into axes in AtenViking hands
               our maidens ran off with one Richard of Arkham
               and we're all that's left to return to our lands

               MacChluarains and Monsters, Lockehaven and Foxmoor
               that Kingdom is BIG and its' fighters are MEAN!
               we fought and we lost, and fled back to Ann Arbor
               we all came back home with results that you've seen

               keep away from that Land with its' cactus and marshes
               it's no place for Mongols who are bent on War
               they count their blows well, but they strick them yet better
               he crawled into his Yurt, and fell, dead, on the floor.....

       tune: the song of the Cowardly Lion, Tin Woodsman and Scarecrow
             in the movie version of the Wizard of Oz

        (Enter the Scarecrow, who singeth:)

        My wife is always nagging; my Prowess it is lagging
        I can't do anything
        she has got a reason, but revenge is out of season
        Oh I wish I could be King!

        If I just had the Crown on, I'd always have a frown on
        and the Barons on a string
        Heads they would be rolling, the Board would be cajoling
        Oh if only I was King!

        I am very fed up with the way this group is set up
        Oh I'd change everything!
        they are so high and mighty with the way that they do fight-ey
        Oh, someday I'll be King!

        Tho my wife is melancholic, and very...vitriolic
        she's a wasp without a sting!
        I'd have to supervise her with a pack of tranquilizers
        If I only was a King......

        (the Tin Woodsman joineth him, and singeth:)

        I grew up kind of cocky, and rather big, and stocky
        and straight as any rod
        on the field I'm a battallion, with the Ladies I'm a stallion
        ...Oh they'd better make me God!

        The other boys are jealous they say I'm over-zealous
        they'd do better to applaud
        the things that I am giving to this Dream that we are living
        oh I wish they'd make me God!

        They say that I'm conceited, but I'm just badly treated
        by people and by BoD
        just think of what they're missing by My Majesty dismissing
        Oh they'd better make me God!

        (the Cowardly Lion creepeth forth, and singeth:)

        Oh I could be a fighter, a great and mighty smiter
        and be the perfect knight
        it's a great and nasty shame, and everyone's to blame
        oh I wish that I could fight!

        Song of the Three (cont.)

        I could be a Cavalier drinking wine and ale and beer
        and be a gorgeous sight
        but it would cost me too much money so it isn't very funny
        oh I wish that I could fight!                               

        Let me at 'em on the field, I would surely make them yield
        to my Power and my Might
        with rattan, shinai and rapier they would nevermore escape here
        If they'd only let me fight

    And if you ever loved me dear, prepare my plot and stone
    Turn loose my hawks and hunting hounds: I'll not be riding home.

    I cannot live with broken heart; the wound you gave will kill.
    And Death's cold hand is on my Soul, I feel his awful chill.
    My Destiny lies on the Field, in months, or days, or years....
    And if you never loved me dear, shed not your lying tears.

                But the Middle did not want to play...

                  (eins - zwei - drei, but the Dark Horde wouldn't die!)

                      by William Poundstone
                              1983

     Two mentalities are at work here: 1960s rock fans and 1980s
fundamentalist Christians. The idea of phonographically concealed
messages dates from the Paul McCartney death scare of 1969. For
hard-core types, the secret-message rumors never really died. Avid
rock fans have auditioned ever album release since the late 1960s
for hidden nuances. Backward messages, barely audible messages,
and messages on one stereo track only have been alleged. At the
other end of the sociosensual spectrum, fundamentalist Christians
have gotten into the act. TV programs such as PRAISE THE LORD and
THE 700 CLUB have propagated rumors of a satanic plot in the
recording industry, no less, in which various albums conceal
""backward-masked"" demonic murmurings. If THAT sounds too spacey to
be taken seriously, consider that it was the fundamentalist groups
who were behind House Resolution 6363, a bill introduced in the
U.S. House of Representatives by Robert K. Dornan (R., Calif.) in
1982 to label all suspect records: ""WARNING: THIS RECORD CONTAINS
BACKWARD MASKING THAT MAKES A VERBAL STATEMENT WHICH IS AUDIBLE
WHEN THIS RECORD IS PLAYED BACKWARD AND WHICH MAY BE PERCEPTIBLE
AT A SUBLIMINAL LEVEL WHEN THIS RECORD IS PLAYED FORWARD."" In
February 1983, the Arkansas State Senate passed a similar record-
labeling bill by a vote of 86 to 0.
     Contributing to the quasi-occult status of these rumors is
the difficulty of checking them out on home audio equipment. You
pretty much have to take someone else's word for it, or dismiss
the rumors out of hand.
     From a technical standpoint, there are four simple ways to
conceal a verbal message on a recording. The most obvious is to
record the message at a very low volume. The message may then be
recovered by turning the volume up while playing the record or
tape. If the message is faint enough, though, noise levels of home
equipment may garble it. If the accompanying music or lyrics are
loud enough, or if the message itself is indistinct or
electronically modified, it may be hard to hear on any equipment.
     A second gimmick is to record a message on one stereo track
only. Records and tapes have two independent recordings, of
course, normally played simultaneously for stereo effect. On a
record, each stereo track occupies on one side of the V-shaped
groove for the needle. On a tape, the tracks are recorded in
parallel lanes of the magnetic material. The two tracks are called
""right"" and ""left"" after the stereo speakers they will play on.
Otherwise, the tracks are interchangeable -- the sound mixer can
put anything he or she wants on each track. A message on one track
can be masked by simultaneous loud music or lyrics on the opposite
track. With normal stereo balance (or mono equipment) the loud
track drowns out the message track. At home, single-track messages
can be recovered by adjusting the stereo balance so that only the
desired track plays. Sometimes this trick also makes indistinct
words clearer. Even if the words are not exclusively on one track,
they may happen to be more audible on one track.
     A message could be recorded at a speed different from the
rest of the record. Then the record would have to be played faster
or slower than usual to recover the message. Unless the message
was at one of the standard speeds (say, 45 rpm on a 33 1/3 rpm
record), it could not be played normally on home equipment.
     The fourth and most commonly alleged trick is to record a
verbal message backward. Reversed speech has several unexpected
features. One is that syllables are not a constant in the reversal
process. A one-syllable word can have two or three syllables when
played backward. Thus ""number nine"" in the Beatles' REVOLUTION 9
reverses to ""Turn me on, dead man"" (or something like it), a jump
from three to five syllables.
     There is no simple way to predict what a word or phrase will
sound like reversed. Obviously, you can't just reverse the
letters.
     Reversed messages are difficult to recover at home. Record
turntables are not built to go backwards. Some have a neutral
setting, in which the pickup and amplifier remain active and you
can turn the record backward by hand. But hardly anyone has a
stead enough hand to produce satisfactory results.
     With patience, it is possible to reverse a cassette
recording. Transfer the music from the original record or tape
onto a blank tape cassette. Place the cassette flat on a table.
Draw our the part of the tape with the suspected message and snip
it off at both ends. Hold the tape segment horizontally. Rotate it
180 degrees, keep it horizontal at all times. This turns the tape
end for end. Splice the reversed tape segment back onto the two
loose ends of the cassette with strong adhesive tape. Reel the
tape back inside the cassette. The sliced segment will play
backward on an ordinary cassette player.
     I rented a recording studio to test the secret-message
rumors. New copiies of the records in question were transcribed on
a quarter-inch master tape. Where rumor alleged that a single
stereo track contained a message, right and left stereo tracks
were transcribed separately. Records with alleged inaudible
messages were treated similarly. To test claims of reversed
messages, recordings on the master tape were edited out and
spliced in backward. Twenty cuts or portions of cuts from sixteen
albums were tested.


""Another One Bites the Dust""
Queen, THE GAME

Rumor: When played backward, the lyrics say, ""It's fun to smoke
marijuana.""
Findings: There is something that sounds like ""It's fun to smoke
marijuana"" in the reversed music. It is repeated over and over. It
might be rendered no less faithfully, however, as ""sfun to scout
mare wanna."" This ""message"" is the reversal of the song title,
which is repeated as a line in the song.
     Let's make a distinction between engineered and phonetic
reversals. When an artist records a verbal statement, reverses it
by turning the tape end for end, mixes the reversed statement onto
a master tape, and has records and tapes produced from the master,
that is an engineered reversal. When the phonetic properties of
song lyrics are such that they can be reversed to sound like
something else, that is a phonetic reversal.
     ""It's fun to smoke marijuna"" is clearly a phonetic reversal.
The lyrics are perfectly plain played forward (""Another one bites
the dust""), no so plain played backward (""sfun to scout mare
wanna""). With an engineered reversal, the opposite should hold
true: gibberish forward, clear as a bell backward. Some are
prepared to believe that phonetic reversals are just as
intentional as engineered reversals -- that the songwriter
painstakinginly planned the phonetic double-entendre. In the
absence of confirming evidence, that just doesn't wash. It's too
easy to find coincidences. If, for example, the letters of the
alphabet are recited in conventional fashion (Ay, Bee, Cee, etc.)
and reversed, at least five sound like English language words. D
reverses to ""eden,"" F becomes ""pray,"" S becomes ""say,"" V becomes
""even,"" and Z becomes ""easy."" ""It's fun to smoke marijuana"" is
likewise a coincidence.


""A Child is Coming""
Jefferson Starship, BLOWS AGAINST THE EMPIRE

Rumor: When played backward, ""son of Satan.""
Findings: Another phonetic coincidence. The repeated ""It's getting
better"" reverses to an iffy ""son of Satan,"" the ""of"" drawn out and
the ""Satan"" strongly accented on the first syllable.


""Eldorado""
Electric Light Orchestra, ELDORADO

Rumor: When played backward, ""He is the nasty one/ Christ, you're
infernal/ It is said we're dead men/ Everyone who has the mark
will live.""
Findings: Coincidence. The supposed message lurks around the line
""On a voyage of no return to see."" Reversed, this passage becomes
the expected syllable salad -- no one hearing it would describe it
as anything but reversed music. Only if you listen while reading
along with what you're supposed to hear will you get anything. The
rumored version of the message is somewhat fudged. The passage
sounds more like ""He's to nasty one/ Christ you are, Christ,
you're fernal/ There wiss uh, we're dead men..."" There is no ""in""
in what is taken to be ""infernal."" The line that is supposed to be
""Everyone who has the mark will live"" isn't even close, though the
syllable count is right.


""Shoo Be Doo""
The Cars, CANDY-O

Rumor: When played backward, the word ""Satan"" repeated
approximately eleven times.
Findings: Coincidence. The rumor refers to the reversal of the ""Shoo
be doo, shoo be doo, shoo be doo..."" near the end of the song. Given
the mysterious logic of reversed phonemes, these three-syllable units
can be hard as a repeated two-syllable word. The word sounds a little
like ""Satan.""


""Snowblind""
Styx, PARADISE THEATER

Rumor: According to a mimeographed list of suspect records distributed
by Congressman Dornan, the words ""Satan move through our voices"" when
played backwards.
Findings: Negative. Despite repeated listenings, it was not even
possible to identify the part of the reversed track that Dornan et al.
are talking about.


""Stairway to Heaven""
Led Zeppelin, untitled, a.k.a. STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN

Rumor: In reverse, ""I live for Satan... The Lord turns me off...
There's no escaping it... Here's to my sweet Satan... There's power in
Satan... He will give you 666.""
Findings: Coincidence. If you listen very carefully to the ""And it
makes me wonder"" lines in reverse, you'll hear something approaching
""There's no escaping it."" A better description is ""There's no escape
do."" Knock of the last syllable, and you have ""There's no escape,"" a
complete, intelligible sentence in reverse. It's there, all right, but
it's not an unlikely enough coincidence to -- well, make you wonder.
      The ""Satan"" in ""I live for Satan"" is good and clear. The ""I live
for"" part isn't. The other alleged lines are unremarkable. All are
phonetic reversals of the entirely lucid forward lyrics and obviously
just accidents.


""When Electricity Came to Arkansas""
Black Oak Arkansas, BLACK OAK ARKANSAS and RONCH AND ROLL

Rumor: In reverse, ""Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan. He is God. He
is God.""
Findings: The BLACK OAK ARKANSAS cut was reversed. Again, pairs of
reversed syllables are being freely interpreted as ""Satan."" ""He is
God"" was not identifiable.


""Rain""
The Beatles, HEY JUDE

Rumor: Unintelligible lyrics at the end are reversed.
Findings: A true engineered reversal and not really a secret. ""Rain""
seems to have been the first popular recording to incorporate an
obviously reversed lyric. The story is that John Lennon accidentally
spliced the last part of the song in backward and liked the effect.
When reversed, the strange-sounding vocals at the end become
intelligible as a reprise starting with the drawn-out word
""sunshine.""
      The reversal is less apparent to the casual listener than it
might be because the accompanying music is not reversed. The ending
fits in smoothly with the rest of the song, the vocals suggesting a
foreign language.


""Fire on High""
Electric Light Orchestra, FACE THE MUSIC

Rumor: When played backward, ""The music is reversible, but time --
turn back!""
Findings: ""Fire on High"" is instrumental. About twenty-six seconds
into the music, scrambled speech is heard. It is mostly louder than
the accompanying music and begins with a two-syllable unit repeated
several times. The seeming speech lasts for about fourteen seconds.
      Reversing the music confirms that there is a true, engineered
message. In reverse, a voice (Jeff Lynne's?) says, ""The music is
reversible, but time -- turn back! Turn back! Turn back! Turn back!""
All the words are clear and unambiguous. Anyone comparing this to the
alleged reversal on ELO's ""Eldorado"" will have no trouble telling
which is genuine.


""Goodbye Blue Sky""
Pink Floyd, THE WALL

Rumor: In reverse, ""You have discovered the secret message.""
Findings: The ""secret message"" is at the very end of the instrumental
passage following the ""Goodbye Blue Sky"" vocals. It comes just before
the words ""What shall we do"" at the start of the song that is
identified as ""Empty Spaces"" on the record label and as ""What shall we
do now?"" on the record sleeve. Played forward, the message is less
apparent than the FACE THE MUSIC reversal: A reasonably attentive
listener might play THE WALL through and not catch it. It suggests
speech not quite close enough to be overheard. In context this is not
unusual because the ""Goodbye Blue Sky"" instrumental passage includes
""airport noises"" and other sound effects. A loud climax in the music
further masks the unintelligible voice.
      When played backward, the voice (Roger Waters?) plainly intones,
""Congratulations, you have just discovered the secret message. Please
send your answer to old Pink, care of the funny farm..."" As the voice
fades out, there may be another word -- perhaps ""Chalfonte or
""Chelsea"" -- after ""funny farm.""


""Heavy Metal Poisoning""
Styx, KILROY WAS HERE

Rumor: A red sticker on the KILROY WAS HERE cover warns, ""By order of
the Majority for Musical Morality, this album contains secret backward
messages...""
Findings: This is a case of second-generation backward-masking. Styx'
PARADISE THEATER did not contain a backward message, though a lot of
people said it did. So Styx has included a sure enough backward
message on KILROY WAS HERE. It is at the very beginning of ""Heavy
Metal Poisoning."" The reversed speech last about three seconds. There
is no musical background. The words reverse to ""Annuit coeptis. Novus
ordo seclorum."" This is the Latin motto encircling the pyramid on the
back of a dollar bill. The usual translation: ""God has favored our
undertakings. A new order of the ages.""
      The cover sticker's ""Majority for Musical Morality"" is a
fictitious Falwellesque group in the KILROY WAS HERE video. Although
the sticker suggests a plurality of ""messages,"" only one was found.


Space between ""I'm So Tired"" and ""Blackbird""
The Beatles, untitled, a.k.a. THE WHITE ALBUM

Rumor: A reversed message. At the time of the Paul-is-dead stories,
the segue from ""I'm So Tired"" to ""Blackbird"" was offered as evidence.
It was held to contain John Lennon's voice, reveresed, saying ""Paul is
dead, miss him, miss him, miss him."" That interpretation seems
unlikely now, but there is a mysterious low muttering between the
songs.
Findings: The mumbling is actually just to the ""I'm So Tired"" side of
the shiny ""space"" between cuts on the record. Each of the stereo
tracks was recorded separately, twice, and a copy of each track was
reversed. This produced four versions of the two-second passage: right
forward, left forward, right reversed, and left reversed. All were
equally unintelligible. It was not even apparent whether the voice is
forward or reversed. Nor could John Lennon be identified as the
speaker. There are nine or ten syllables. The first six (when played
forward) are a two-syllable unit repeated three times. There is little
or no difference betwen the stereo tracks. Any claimed interpretation
of the sounds seems doubtful.


""Strawberry Fields Forever""
The Beatles, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR

Rumor: It was, of course, claimed that John Lennon says ""I buried
Paul"" at the end. (It's forward, at the very end after the music
fades to complete silence, returns, and starts to fade out again.)
But Lennon told ROLLING STONE that the words are ""cranberry
sauce.""
Findings: They are ""cranberry sauce."" The ""sauce""/""Paul"" part is
indistinct, but the first syllable sounds a lot more like ""cran""
than ""I.""


""Baby You're a Rich Man""
The Beatles, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR

Rumor: On one of the tracks the line ""Baby you're a rich man too""
is sung as ""Baby you're a rich fag Jew,"" a dig at Brian Epstein.
Or some think it's ""rich fat Jew"" and claim it as evidence of
Beatle anti-Semitism.
Findings: Negative. The two stereo tracks are nearly identical.
It's always possible to hear words as similar-sounding words, but
basically, the lyrics jibe with the published version.


""Revolution 9""
The Beatles, untitled, a.k.a. THE WHITE ALBUM

Rumor: Various reversed and/or one-track speech. The reversal of
""Number nine"" to ""Turn me on, dead man"" has pretty much been
discounted as coincidence (though it appears on Congressman
Dornan's list).
Findings: Distinction between lyrics and any hidden message blurs
on ""Revolution 9."" The eight-minute cut is a montage of sounds
collected by John Lennon and Yoko Ono. It includes discordant
music, radio broadcasts, sirens, applause, gunfights, sports
cheers, the crackling of a fire, screams, a baby gurgling, a choir
singing, and much that cannot be identified. For this
investigation, ""Revolution 9"" was transcribed four times, twice on
each stereo channel. One copy of each of the tracks was reversed.
The four resulting versions were compared with each other and
against the original two-channel version.
     ""Revolution 9"" contains a lot of talking. Played in stereo,
forward, the longest stretch of understandable speech is probably
an announcer saying, ""...every one of them knew that as time went
by they'd get a little bit older and a little bit slower...""
     One believable instance of reversed speech occurs: someone
saying ""Let me out! Let me out!"" (once held to represent McCartney
in his totaled Aston-Martin). Two iffy reversals occur on the
backward recording of the right stereo track:""She used to be
assistant"" and ""There were two men..."" Neither is clear enough or
long enough to be convincing. Some of the music, including the
recurring theme, sounds more natural in reverse.
     ""Turn me on, dead man"" is a typical phonetic reversal. The
forward ""number nine"" (repeated throughout the cut) is clear; the
reversal is slurred -- something like ""turn me on dedmun."" It has
been claimed that ""number nine"" must be pronounced with a British
accent or with some careful inflection in order to reverse to
""Turn me on, dead man."" This seems not to be so. As an experiment,
three American-accent renderings of ""number nine"" were reversed.
All sound about as much like ""Turn me on, dead man"" as the record
did. Like the other phonetic reversals, ""Turn me on, dead man""
must be considered a coincidence.
     Much of ""Revolution 9"" is on one stereo track only. Near the
end a voice says ""A fine natural imbalance...the Watusi...the
twist...Eldorado...Eldorado."" ""A fine natural imbalance"" is on the
right track only, though the words that follow are in stereo. One
of the longer bits of speech -- ""Who could tell what he was
saying? His voice was low and his [unintelligible] was high and
his eyes were low"" -- is clear on the left track, a bare whisper
on the right.
     There is a stereophonically concealed ""secret message"" on
""Revolution 9."" The words are on the right track. They begin about
four minutes, fifty-eight seconds into the cut and run for about
twenty-two seconds. They are not likely to be noticed in stereo
because of the much louder left track. The sound of applause
begins on the left track at about five minutes, one second into
the cut. Deafening noises -- the clapping, sirens, music --
continue on the left track until five minutes, forty seconds. It
may or may not have been Lennon's and Ono's intention to conceal
the spoken passage. Given the haphazard quality of ""Revolution 9,""
the concealment may have been accidental. To recover the passage,
the left track must be switched off. The right track can then be
heard to contain a sound like a stopwatch ticking, behind these
words:

     So the wife called, and we better go to see a
     surgeon....[A SCREAM MUFFLES A LINE THAT SOUNDS LIKE
     Well, what with the prices, the prices have snowballed,
     no wonder it's closed.] ...So any and all, we went to
     see the dentist instead, who gave him a pair of teeth,
     which wasn't any good at all. So instead of that he
     joined the bloody navy and went to sea.
                      by William Poundstone
                              1986

     There really are backward messages on rock albums. And the
controversy over ""backward masking"" and ""porn rock"" has inspired a
whole new spate of messages. There may have been more genuine
backward messages in the past few years than ever before.
     The backward message controversy is usually traced to the
1960s and John Lennon's avant-garde sound mixing on such tracks as
""Revolution 9"" on the Beatles' WHITE ALBUM. Lennon probably wasn't
trying to conceal a message so much as create an interesting
sound.
     The matter might have ended right there had it not been for
the Paul McCartney death rumor. College kids tried playing Beatles
records forward, backward, and at various speeds to find ""clues""
to McCartney's fate. In the process they found snippets of speech
from Lennon's experiments. Even after McCartney was found safe and
sound in Scotland, some listeners continued to look for hidden
messages.
     Somehow, fundamentalist Christian groups became convinced
(ca. 1982) that the alleged messages were commercials for devil
worship. Not a single indisputable satanic message has turned up,
but there were scattered attempts to ban or label certain albums.
In 1986 one fundamentalist group announced that the theme song for
the old MR. ED TV show contains the word ""Satan"" when played
backward.)
     Ironically, the publicity accorded nonexistent messages has
inspired several artists -- among them porn rock hearing witness
Frank Zappa -- to hide real background messages in their music.
It's easy to do.
     The performer speaks or sings the message normally, then
reverses the tape, which is mixed into the soundtrack. This is all
accomplished simply enough at any recording studio.
     What's not so simple is playing it back. More home record,
cassette, and compact disk players won't play backward. You can
turn a record backward with a pencil eraser, but it's not good for
the needle or the turntable. The only way to reproduce the message
with full fidelity is to use a professional-quality reel-to-reel
tape player and splice the tape in backward.
     We used the facilities of KLOS radio in Los Angeles to
reverse some recent records containing true backward messages.


""Secret Messages""
Electric Light Orchestra, SECRET MESSAGES

ELO's ELDORADO album was among those alleged to contain satanic
backward masked messages. A patient listening to ELDORADO played
backward reveals no such messages. You hear only what you ought to
hear -- the reversed lyrics of the songs, which sound nothing like
the ""messages"" claimed to be there. In the wake of such
allegations, ELO did put an (innocuous) backward message on their
FACE THE MUSIC album. Perhaps they thought this would show how
silly the allegations were. Instead, the backward-masking people
seized on this as proof that the other ""messages"" were real. In
the latest volley, ELO has named an album after the controversy.
     In Britain (where the backward-masking issue is viewed as an
American eccentricity), the cover of SECRET MESSAGES has a mock
warning label to youth about the hidden label. Word of the albums'
impending release in the United States caused enough of a furor to
chill CBS Records into deleting the cover blurb.
     The reversed message is easy to find. It's at the beginning
of the first song, which is itself called ""Secret Messages."" You
can hear reversed speech when you play the record normally. A
voice intones ""secret messages"" -- forward -- in the middle of the
reversed speech, lest anyone dare be so unhip as to not know
what's going on.
     We transferred a new copy of SECRET MESSAGES to reel-to-reel
tapes and played it backward. The backward message goes: ""WELCOME
TO THE BIG SHOW/ WELCOME TO THE BIG SHOW.""
     That's it.


""Ya Hozna""
Frank Zappa, THEM OR US

""Ya Hozna,"" a six-minute composition on the first record of the
THEM OR US double album, is ENTIRELY backward. The albums' inner
cover, which includes lyrics for the other songs, says, ""backwards
vocal -- you figure it out"" of this cut. It credits Frank and Moon
Zappa, George Duke, and Napoleon Murphy Brock as vocalists.
     Played forward, ""Ya Howza"" sounds like a record played
backward -- reasonably so. The vocals are prominent and
unintelligible. Moon Zappa's voice is curiously recognizable, even
in reverse. It is hard to tell whether the music was recorded
forward or backward.
     When ""Ya Howza"" is played in reverse, you discover that the
music is virtually a palindrome -- it sounds about the same
forward and backward. The voices are all backward. In some cases
they have been modified electronically. Many of the words are
muffled. Even after repeated careful listening on both stereo
tracks, it is difficult to make out many of the lyrics. It doesn't
help that some of the words seem to be stream-of-consciousness
nonsense. Some of the unintelligible stuff sounds like opera.
     Starting at the beginning of the reversed tape -- the end of
the forward tape -- the clearer vocals go like this: ""I am the
heaven, I am the water."" This is in a hymnlike register. ""You are
a lonely little girl./ But your mommy and your daddy hold you."" A
singsong synthesizer voice.
     The most interesting part of the lyrics is an intermittently
orgasmic rap in Moon Zappa's Valley Girl voice. There are three
short monologues:

I'm like green!
I'm like squat!
I'm like soul!
Repeat, like soul!
I'm like pull, push,
Okay, like slow, slow.

You're never too old
Like slow, like slow, like slow
Okay, I like it.


All right, faster, faster,
Go, do it, do it twice,
Yeah, that feels good,
I'm looking great,
Yeah, fer shure!
Like, no way!


""No Anchovies, Please""
J. Geils Band, LOVE STINKS

""No Anchovies, Please"" is a novelty song, really a narration with
sound effects, about a woman who is kidnapped after eating
anchovies. She is taken to a ""foreign-speaking"" country. The sound
effect of the foreign tongue seems reversed. When you do play it
in reverse, it becomes: ""It doesn't take a genius to know the
difference between chicken shit and chicken salad.""


""Darling Nikki""
Prince, PURPLE RAIN

""Darling Nikki,"" cited as porn rock before Congress, is about a
dominatrix in a hotel lobby masturbating with a magazine. In part,
the complaint was that the album cover (flowers, and Prince on a
motorcycle) wasn't explicit enough to warn kids of the suggestive
lyrics. Senator Paula Hawkins apparently was not aware of a
backward message hidden in ""Darling Nikki."" The last thirty-five
seconds of the song is gibberish. The music changes abruptly and
becomes a repeated glottal sound. Then a two-syllable sound is
repeated twice, something like ""heaven, heaven."" Unintelligible
speech follows. At the end is a sound reminiscent of rain or bacon
frying , and wind sounds.
     Played backward, the message becomes:

     Hello, how are you?
     I'm fine 'cause I know that the Lord is coming soon.
     Coming, coming soon.

     It is clearly Prince and the Revolution singing this. The
words are clear but the intonation is funny -- the linger on some
words. Perhaps this is to make the reversed message you hear
playing the record normally a little less conspicuous.
     This is a weird reversal of the supposed secret message
menace. Raunchy forward lyrics conceal a religious secret message.


""Judas Kiss""
Petra, MORE POWER TO YOU

Petra is an obscure group that sings religious songs to a rock
beat. As further proof that things have gone full circle, the
backward-masking controversy prompted Petra to include a wholesome
backward message on their MORE POWER TO YOU album. It is in the
transition between two songs, just before ""Judas Kiss."" Clearly
audible gibberish reverses to this (the husky voice a cross
between George Beverly Shea and Dee Snider): ""What are you looking
for the Devil for, when you ought to be looking for the Lord?""

AFL JoyceM Welcome to the Apple II Music & Sound chat - our discussion will
           be on NoiseTracker - the new FTA music program for the GS.  AFA
           Gene will be our host this evening...Gene, the floor is yours :)

AFA Gene   Hi all... well first I'd like to point out, if y'all aren't aware
           yet, that a spanking new version of NoiseTracker has recently
           been released (9 days ago) and is now available in our New Files
           library. It is version 0.5. I haven't played around with it much
           yet, but it's supposed to fix a lot of the little bugs in 0.3
           (the first version we had online).  NoiseTracker also includes
           the ability to directly import ""modules,"" a term used for a
           certain type of Amiga song file which has become popular among PC
           users using the SoundBlaster sound card.

           Now, via NT, these ""MOD"" files are accessible by the GS. We
           expect to see a lot of activity on this end as far as ports from
           the PC and Amiga go. Note that you should be able to go straight
           to the PC music forum and download any recently uploaded MOD
           songfiles (there was a bug in the first wide release of the PCAO
           software, however, so a bunch of files with dates between around
           March 1991 and September 1991 may not download properly. Note that
           to use these PC MOD files, you'll have to rename the downloaded
           file ""MOD.xxxxxx"" if you want it to show up automatically in NT's
           ""open"" dialog box. (On the PC, all MOD files are named
           ""xxxxxxxx.MOD"" instead.)   Also, if the files are packed with ZIP
           compression, you'll need a program from the Communications Forum
           called AGATE -- it's a terminal program that includes the ability
           to unpack ZIP files.

           Now, I guess the best thing to do would be to talk about our
           favorite songfiles... there have been a few complaints, in fact,
           that people were not being ""descriptive"" enough in their file
           descriptions for uploads in describing the songs.

AFC Eddie  ?

AFA Gene   GA ed

AFC Eddie  Once a MOD file is unpacked with Agate, is a file type change
           needed?

AFA Gene   Nope, since all that NT looks for is the ""MOD."" being the first
           four characters in the filename.

AFC Eddie  OK, Thanks!

Deanna7332 Question...

JonL7      Can you list some of the features of Noisetracker?

AFA Gene   (you don't even need that ""MOD."" if you want to type the name in
           directly.)

Deanna7332 Did any of these mod files have anything to do with FTA's ""Module
           A""

AFA Gene   Sure Jon, right after we answer Deanna's question. Deanna, you
           mean ""Modulae?""

Deanna7332 Yes, that's it.

AFA Gene   Modulae was a demo written by FTA last year. (i'll get to you in a
           sec Doors).  It used SoundSmith v0.95 for all it's music. There
           is no connection between MOD files and Modulae by FTA.

Deanna7332 Throughout the demo it said ""Loading modules""

AFA Gene   Those ""modules"" are not the same as Amiga soundfile ""modules"" --
           you see, what Modulae really was was a ""stringing together"" of a
           bunch of neat little tiny demos that FTA had written. So they
           called each little demo a ""module"" and thus the entire demo as a
           whole, ""Modulae"" (fancy plural of module?)

Deanna7332 Ok I understand.  Thank you. :)

AFL JoyceM Latin, Gene :)

AFA Gene   The term ""MODule"" from the Amiga comes from the idea that all the
           stuff needed to play the songfile (all the instruments + the
           sequence file) are included into one file, the ""module.""

TheDoors1  Gene, I have tried to d/l some recent uploaded MODs in the PC
           music area and still the problem exists.

AFA Gene   As I understand it, the problem was fixed VERY recently (correct
           me on this Joyce) and files uploaded as recently as early
           November still might not work depending on the version of the
           PCAO software that the uploader used.

AFL JoyceM Actually, Gene...I was under the impression that it had been, but
           if Doors is still having a problem, then it must not be fixed.

AFA Gene   What date was the file you tried to d/l, Door?

TheDoors1  umm 11/17, around there

AFA Gene   hmmm.... well i can tell you one thing... if it didn't work, don't
           waste your time again later... the problem is in the Apple
           software's method of d/lling files, and there are no plans to
           upgrade the Apple AO software.

AFL JoyceM I will endeavor to get an answer to that PC downloading
           problem/question :)

ThomasK63  i have a quick question... what can you use to unpack amiga mod
           files? On the PC side, that is.

TheDoors1  Agate Thomas

ELECTMUSIC Doors... what happens on after downloading..

Deanna7332 If it's LZHed you can't unless you have an IBM or
           PC/Transporter.

AFA Gene   If GS-ShrinkIt doesn't have that ability, i don't think there
           exists any such utility on the GS.

TheDoors1  What do you mean Elect?

ELECTMUSIC After you download the file... where do you encounter a problem?

TheDoors1  ok, you know when you download the file and at some point in the
           download the file starts to appear on your screen.  That's when I
           cancel it.

ThomasK63  I am sure soething good can be made w/out resorting to Amiga
           files

AFC Eddie  Yes, Doors, I believe the problem is with the PC software it was
           UL'd with.

TheDoors1  yeah Eddie.

GNO Tim    Amiga MOD files are typically compressed using LHarc.  I've
           uncompressed several on my Unix machine at school.

ThomasK63  good time for someone to make a lharc unpacker...

AFC DYAJim someone might be ;)

GNO Tim    Several people are already

AFC Eddie  Can't wait, Jim!

AFA Gene   Jon, did you have a question?

JonL7      The features of Noisetracker :)

AFA Gene   Oh yes... okay, here goes, in a nutshell, from most important to
           least:


AFA Gene   *  ability to import MOD files

           *  ability to import Soundsmith files

           *  ProDOS 8 based

           *  virtually no editing abilities (not a feature but important to
           know)

AFC DYAJim :)

AFA Gene   *  forgot: and the most important feature of all, the ability to
           hold instrument files in regular system RAM instead of DOC RAM,
           allowing for instruments far beyond the regular 64K limit found
           in ALL other GS music programs.

ThomasK63  I'll buy that!

TheDoors1  I have another question...when you're ready.

AFA Gene   GA Doors

TheDoors1  ok..is it true that NoiseTracker will take in soundsmith files and
           play them more clearly

AFA Gene   Well, as far as ""what you hear,"" yes there is a definite
           difference with some instruments. It does NOT play the sounds
           more ""clearly,"" but it just plays them in a different way. What
           many people seem to like about this ""different way"" is that
           sustained instruments (i.e. instruments designed to be played
           in a loop to simulate a long held note) seem to work better (or
           perhaps simply the way they were originally intended to work).

TheDoors1  I see

Deanna7332 Which takes up more space - MOD or NT  w/soundfile ?

AFA Gene   Deanna, it depends a few things, such as how big the sequence is,
           how many instruments you have, etc. Once you have a lot of
           assorted files, it'll probably average out to be about the same
           give or take a hundred blocks on your HD. So it basically depends
           on whether you prefer to have your instruments separate or not.

Deanna7332 Does playing quality differ with either one ?

AFA Gene   Nope. It's exactly the same either way. Loading time is the same
           too.

AFC Eddie  Can NT save songs as MOD files?

AFA Gene   Nope. It has options for Open and Close module, but these are
           still inactive.

AFA Gene   If there are no more questions, I'd like to talk about which NT
           files out there are the ""hottest,"" since this info could be
           useful to many users who are interested in downloading NT/MOD
           files.

           My personal favorite is ""Lambada,"" which is supplied by FTA with
           the program but is available separately on America
           Online.Everything about this file is really impressive except
           perhaps the sound quality of the horn-ish melody instrument.

           What about y'all, what are your favorite NT files?

AFL JoyceM Gene, there is a classical song for NT, but can't remember the
           name, but it is good.

AFC Eddie  I like Dragnet!

ELECTMUSIC So do I Ed

TheDoors1  I like Seven something

Deanna7332 My most favorite of all mod files is Pleasure Principle

AFC Eddie  <--appreciate's Greg's taste!

AFL JoyceM :)

AFA Gene   Deanna, i assume you got that from a local board?

Deanna7332 I got it from the PC forum here.

TheDoors1  I saw it there also

Deanna7332 I think under ""Pleasure""

AFA Gene   Would you be able to upload it here? If it's really that good, we
           ought to have it available directly in our oun NT lib here (BTW
           folks, we will be releasing a new NoiseTracker software library
           soon!)

AFC Eddie  What a Forum!!!

Deanna7332 That sounds great!

AFL JoyceM Gene, do you think it will be possible for synthLAB files to be
           converted to MOD files?

AFL JoyceM MOD files?

AFA Gene   I doubt it, Joyce. The formats are so diametrically opposed in
           their entire basis of their file formats that it wouldn't be
           worth the time for a programmer to develop such a convertor.

Deanna7332 Isn't it possible to move the mod file from the PC forum to our
           music library?

AFA Gene   But..... it might be worth the time for a MIDI File Format to MOD
           convertor, since these two formats are more widely accepted.

Nuzz       they have nothing better to do Gene

ELECTMUSIC Gene.. some interesting similarities with DTune and NTracker

AFA Gene   They lose the file, tho, Deanna. :)

AFL JoyceM In what way, Greg?

ELECTMUSIC Both Prodos 8

Deanna7332 Shhh they won't know a thing :)

ELECTMUSIC I also believe Bill uses a shuttling of sound data between Doc
           Ram and Ram.

AFC Eddie  Interesting, Greg.

ELECTMUSIC Thats how he gets some of the excellent instrument quality

AFC Eddie  But Diversitune has that one distinction:  MIDI input.

AFL JoyceM Deanna, we would greatly appreciate it if you would upload that
           'Pleasure' song to our library :)

ELECTMUSIC Agreed Ed.. one of the factors FTA doesn't like to incorporate
           into their programs.

Deanna7332 I'll u/l it tonight if possible.

AFL JoyceM Thanks :)

AFC Eddie  Thanks, Deanna!

AFL JoyceM I will send Bill B a copy of NoiseTracker + some MOD files...to
           see what comments we get from him (will send when I get back).

AFC DYAJim What ever happened to that diversitune upgrade that was talked
           about ?

ELECTMUSIC That would be interesting Joyce

AFC Eddie  Bill apparently still working on it, Jim.

ELECTMUSIC I am sure he would appreciate the Prodos 8

AFC DYAJim good..

AFL JoyceM Jim...RSN....he was hoping by Christmas (this year), but he is
           soooo busy with his job, who knows?

AFC DYAJim Oh yeah, I noticed the speed calcuation in NT .5 is inaccurate
           :)

AFC DYAJim I recall he has set a lot of Christmas projected dates :)

ELECTMUSIC He was one of the first ""Free Tools"" experts in breaking all the
           rules for economic sake.

AFC DYAJim like for the vaporware DT inst editor like 2 years ago.

Deanna7332 Are there any Christmas Mod or NT songs?

AFC Eddie  Oh yeah, Diversi-Editor!

AFL JoyceM I know, Jim - but that I know he has been working on.

AFC DYAJim he projected Christmas for it, and it never came :)

AFA Gene   Not yet in AMS, but hopefully the Holiday Contest will change all
           that. :)

AFC DYAJim I look foreward to any upgrades..

AFL JoyceM Not that I am aware of Deanna - you have some?  hint, hint

Deanna7332 Nope sorry.  I was hoping there were some that could be u/led
           here

AFC DYAJim I'll be breaking out the xmas tune book rsn.. I should be able to
           midi a few :) (which rules out nt)

AFL JoyceM Question...

AFC Eddie  It would be more appropriate to have a converter from Appleworks
           spreadsheet to MOD than from MIDI!

AFL JoyceM If I got ahold of an Amiga song (MOD) disk...how would I convert
           them for here?

AFA Gene   You mean an Amiga-formatted disk?

AFL JoyceM Yes

AFC DYAJim Ack.. methinks you need an amiga and a null modem cable or a
           modem.

AFA Gene   Methinks Jim is right

AFC DYAJim LOL!!  Design your music in the spreadsheet then import to NT :)
           IT might actually have better editing?!! :)

AFC Eddie  Right!

AFL JoyceM Me thinks he is right.  If I had them upload to me, would that
           work?

AFA Gene   Yep; should work like a charm.

AFC DYAJim Yah.. as long as they're coming from an amiga

AFL JoyceM Great....I will work on that when I get back  (making note now).

AFL JoyceM Gene, will you get some of those files (NT) sent to that area
           tonight?  If so, I will leave the needed message :)

AFA Gene   That's all I have planned for tonight's chat, Joyce. Yep, I'll
           move some files right now.

AFL JoyceM Thanks...

AFL JoyceM Then we should have our NoiseTracker Library by end of the week in
           AMS :)

ELECTMUSIC Gene... quick question:  Are you launching NTracker from a 3.5
           disk?

AFL JoyceM Okay, guys...I will see you all the week of December 11th (may the
           4th) as I am off on vacation.

AFA Gene   Yep greg

AFC JohnC  Where are you going?

ELECTMUSIC Do you encounter out of memory problems

AFL JoyceM Night all...and Gene, thanks for an excellent chat and great
           explanations of NoiseTracker.

Nuzz       Joyce, I have good news for FutureSound owners. SoundConvert will
           support it in the first release

AFC Eddie  Great, Mike!

AFA Gene   Greg, i always keep my RAMdisk at 0 when using noisetracker. Not
           only are

AFC JohnC  Mike...SoundConvert...released?

AFL JoyceM Great, Mike.  When can we get SoundConvert, Mike? and FutureSound
           :)

AFA Gene   there a couple of bugs with memory management, but if you're
           loading in a MOD file that's really big, NT will eat your RAMdisk.

AFC Eddie  Sounds good.

Nuzz       The manual is being ""layout"". Release date should be about 1st
           week of Dec

ELECTMUSIC Tnxs Gene

AFC JohnC  YES.......WTG Nuzz!!!!!!!!

Deanna7332 Yes, why is there on some MOD files a stop somewhere in the middle
           ?

Deanna7332 That's really frustrating!

AFL JoyceM Mike, leave me E-Mail on when and how I can send your the $$ to
           get it.

AFL JoyceM Again...night all

Nuzz       gee John, I had to do something to explain the delay :)

ELECTMUSIC Thanks Gene for a GREAT chat!

AFC Eddie  Yes, Gene!  Great!

AFA Gene   Thanks Greg, 'night!

AFA Gene   thanx, see y'all later :)

Copyright 1987 Bob Szekely.

    John Michael Osbourne, (known as ""Ozzy"" to his fans), has in his long 
career as vocalist for Black Sabbath had his work with the group misconstrued 
as advocating Satanism.  In a 1983 radio special featuring Ozzy, the 
interviewer expressed precisely this point; ""...Ozzy has always been shrouded 
in the darkest of Satanic imagery.  Yet if you really listen to his music, 
you'll find that what he is saying differs greatly from his image....""(1)  Even 
the group's image has often been described as ""occult and diabolic"".(2)

    The important point to remember here is to differentiate between appearance 
and reality.  Although the name ""Black Sabbath"" conjures up images of witches 
and sorcerers paying homage to Satan for the powers bestowed upon them, this 
does not make it safe to assume that the group that went by this name 
necessarily drew the inspiration from the occult.(3)  The closest they ever 
came to it was a gothic horror film featuring Boris Karloff as narrator; they 
adopted their name directly from the name of this film.(4)  Black Sabbath was 
involved in the black arts as much as Karloff practiced casting spells off-
screen.  Tony Iommi, the group's guitarist, summed it up best when he described 
the group as having basically ""...the same appeal as a horror movie.  It's all 
an act.""(5)










    Just as their film counterpart did, Ozzy and Sabbath found the occult 
mythos to be an effective vehicle for powerful social commentary; particularly 
when put in the context of heavy-metal rock and roll.  Ozzy himself noted that 
there are ""...people who pick up my [album] cover[s] and go...'This guy's got 
to be singing about Devil, doom, death and destruction.'  Which is not the 
case....""(6)

    The late Lester Bangs likened the group to Bob Dylan and William Burroughs, 
describing them all as ""...moralists...trying to deal with a serious present 
situation in an honest way....""(7)  Ozzy and Black Sabbath merely bring to 
light the many evils of our world in their work, to try and make us realize 
that we are all victim to their influence.  They hope to make us recognize 
these evils so that we may take up arms against them; a point Ozzy emphatically 
stresses:  ""...one thing everybody has got to understand about Black Sabbath's 
lyrics.  They're not downer lyrics, they're just telling everybody where it's 
at...""(8)  He also cites the group's most controversial tune, ""Black Sabbath"", 
as a response to the ignorant hippie culture still force when the tune was 
written in 1970:  ""The hippies said: 'The world is beautiful man.' (sic)  You 
only had to look around you to see how crappy it was.  It was ridiculous 
listening to that stuff, let alone playing it, so we just wrote about the world 
the way it really was and how it affected us - and we felt better in ourselves

    I   1   HAVE YOU EVER THOUGH ABOUT YOUR SOUL-
        2   CAN IT BE SAVED?
        3   OR PERHAPS YOU THINK THAT WHEN YOU ARE DEAD
        4   YOU JUST STAY IN YOUR GRAVE.
        5   IS GOD JUST A THOUGHT WITHIN YOUR HEAD OR IS
        6   HE A PART OF YOU?
        7   IS CHRIST JUST A NAME THAT YOU READ IN A BOOK
        8   WHEN YOU WERE AT SCHOOL?

    II  9   WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT DEATH DO YOU LOSE
        10  YOUR BREATH OR DO YOU KEEP YOUR COOL?
        11  WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE THE POPE ON THE END
        12  OF A ROPE - DO YOU THINK HE'S A FOOL?
        13  WELL I'VE SEEN THE TRUTH - YES I'VE SEEN 
        14  THE LIGHT AND I'VE CHANGED MY WAYS.
        15  AND I'LL BE PREPARED WHEN YOU'RE LONELY 
        16  AND SCARED AT THE END OF OUR DAYS.

    III 17  COULD IT BE YOU'RE AFRAID OF WHAT YOU'R
        18  FRIENDS MIGHT SAY 
        19  IF THEY NEW YOU BELIEVED IN GOD ABOVE
        20  THEY SHOULD REALISE BEFORE THE CRITICISE
        21  THAT GOD IS THE ONLY WAY TO LOVE.

    IV  23  IS YOUR MIND SO SMALL THAT YOU HAVE TO FALL
        24 IN WITH THE PACK WHEREVER THEY RUN
        25  WILL YOU STILL SNEER WHEN DEATH IS NEAR
        26  AND SAY THEY MAY AS WELL WORSHIP THE SUN.

    V   27  I THINK IT WAS TRUE IT WAS PEOPLE LIKE YOU
        28  THAT CRUCIFIED CHRIST
        29  I THINK IT IS SAD THE OPINION YOU HADE WAS THE
        30  ONLY ONE VOICED.
        31  WILL YOU BE SO SURE WHEN YOUR DAY IS NEAR
        32  SAY YOU DON'T BELIEVE?
        33  YOU HAD THE CHANCE BUT YOU TURNED IT DOWN
        34  NOW YOU CAN'T RETRIEVE.










    VI  35  PERHAPS YOU'LL THINK BEFORE YOU SAY THAT
        36  GOD IS DEAD AND GONE
        37  OPEN YOUR EYES, JUST REALIZE THAT HE IS THE
        38  ONE.
        39  THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN SAVE YOU KNOW FROM
        40  ALL THIS SIN AND HATE.
        41  OR WILL YOU STILL JEER AT ALL YOU HEAR?
        42  YES!-I THINK IT'S TOO LATE.

    In this piece, the group asserts a belief in an afterlife and spiritual 
redemption.  As grisly as the image of a hanged pontiff is, its shock value is 
a necessary part of the message:  They reject religious dogma, stating that a 
belief in God, in one's own heart, is the only guiding light to help one inn 
his life (lines 11/12, 39/40).  Furthermore, the reject religious hypocrisy 
(lines 5/6, 7/8) and peer pressure (verses III, IV) as excuses for not 
accepting God.  To clarify further:  following the crowd does not justify 
shrugging responsibility for one's own actions.

    After re-reading, it becomes obvious that this song is an ascerbic critique 
of atheism; (line 35/36) I refer here again to verses three and four.  In these 
two verses, the picture painted in one of Godless conformity and how it's 
viewed as being as foolish as Paganism.  These lyrics set an example for the 
listener by relating personal experience (lines 13-16).  However, for those who 
cannot accept this the group has no recourse but to condemn them, although 
rather ironically; they hope that their rhetorical loss of faith in the 
listener will open his eyes (line 42).

            WHAT IS THIS, THAT STANDS BEFORE ME?
            FIGURE IN BLACK, WHICH POINTS AT ME
            TURN ROUND QUICK AND START TO RUN
            FIND OUT I'M THE CHOSEN ONE.  OH, NO!
            
            BIG BLACK SHAPE WITH EYES OF FIRE
            TELLING PEOPLE THEIR DESIRE
            SATAN'S SITTING THERE, HE'S SMILING
            WATCHES THOSE FLAMES GET HIGHER AND HIGHER
            OH, NO, NO, -- PLEASE GOD HELP ME!
            
                IS THIS THE END MY FRIEND?
                SATAN'S COMING 'ROUND THE BEND
                PEOPLE RUNNING 'CAUSE THEY'RE SCARED
                THE PEOPLE BETTER GO AND BEWARE
                NO, NO!  PLEASE--NO!!
                
                
    The all time controversy winner!  Is this not irrefutably  THE song about 
Black Magic in rock?  It's all so obvious, suffuse with evil imagery; Satan, 
walls of flame, figure in black, and damnation at the end.  Yes, I see the 
images too; it definitely concerns Black Magic.  Then again, Shakespeare's 
Macbeth employed scenes of witches involved in conjurations; does that mean 
that Shakespeare was a warlock?  Poe used to write sardonic tragedies about 
twisted murderers and the bizarre nature of acts, did that make him an evil, 
leering, demented killer?  Did either of them advocated what they wrote about?  
One has to remember that writing about something is not necessarily the same as 
emulating it.  Tony Iommi spoke out quite strongly about this:  ""People are 
bringing us down saying that we are a Black Magic group.  I think they must be










getting mixed up with Black Widow.  We don't do any sacrifices on stage, and 
we're not on a black magic kick.  We wanted to do heavy numbers and the guitar 
riffs we worked out were more suited to evil things than love.  We play songs 
about black magic, but they are more likely to be against than for it.""(12)  

    By now, you're probably asking yourself who Black Widow is, right?  Then 
it's time for a little history:

        Sabbath, before they were known as Sabbath, had the same line-up but 
two earlier names.  The first one was Polka Tulk, which seemed sure to doom 
them to obscurity.(13)  The soon realized this and changed the group's name to 
Earth.  Now, Earth was a blues band at the end of the English blues boom.  As 
if that wasn't bad enough, they soon discovered that not only was there another 
group named Earth, but they had also released a single.  To avoid confusion, 
they changed their name again.(14)  But what made them decide on that name?  
Just ask Ozzy:  ""I just liked the name Black Sabbath because of the succession 
of vowel sounds.(15)  If that sounds ludicrous just consider this:  Sabbath was 
""...the first of the really committed, loud and heavy bands...""(16)  They 
needed a name to match the gut-wrenching power they were developing.  Tony knew 
that he wanted Sabbath to be noticed above all the rest of the British blues 
bands:  ""We wanted something of our own that we'd like and people would like.  
And we wanted something loud!""










    Tony didn't hate the blues.  He'd cut his teeth as a guitarist on the likes 
of The Shadows, Buddy Holly and Django Rheinhardt, developing his own style 
from there.  But he realized the group had no future in the blues:

        'We couldn't keep playing 12-bars forever.  We just got fed up with 
Earth music.  It was jazz, blues stuff.  It was good for practice but nothing 
else.'

    In the late 'Sixties, blues groups were a dime a dozen in Birmingham and 
interest was waning in the blues boom due to the glut of groups.  One man, by 
the name of Jim Simpson, had heard Earth around the Birmingham club circuit and 
understood what they were trying to do.  He decided to take them under his 
wing.  With the aid of his massive record collection, Jim expanded the group's 
horizons in the areas of jazz and blues.  He introduced them to artists like 
Wes Montgomery, Count Basie and Jimmy Rushing.  It was from Rushing in 
particular that they derived the repetitive riff style so readily noticeable in 
their later incarnation as Black Sabbath.

    The Count Basie influence is evidenced in the song ""Wicked World"" from the 
first album; Sabbath drummer Bill Ward uses a ""'sighing hi-hat'...in the manner 
of Basie's drummer Jo Jones.""










    The influence is subtle, almost subliminal.  Yet it is one which was not 
thought capable of hard, 'heavy' rock bands in the late 'Sixties.  Although Led 
Zeppelin and Jimi Hendrix also had their work steeped in blues and jazz 
derivations (Hendrix' ""Third Stone From the Sun"" and Zeppelin's version of 
Willie Dixon's ""I Can't Quit You Baby"" from their first album), neither was 
able to match the intense energy of Black Sabbath.  Iommi has always had a 
preference for music with an original, distinct style of its' own; as an 
example, he mentions guitarists Joe Pass and Alvin Lee as two of his strongest 
songwriting influences.

    It would also be necessary that Sabbath develop a unique, distinctive style 
and image of their own.  Though they had changed their name from Earth to Black 
Sabbath to avoid confusion with the other Earth; at the same time another group 
emerged by the name of Black Widow ""...who WERE profoundly influenced by the 
occult, had a male witch as a patron, and wrote pieces like ""Come to The 
Sabbat.""  Unfortunately, Sabbath was constantly reaping the benefits of Widow's 
publicity.

    Sabbath was a group that never minced words.  If they saw something as 
destructive, they would be sure to rub the listener's face it it.  They did not 
want their point to be missed.

    With their straightforward, sometimes brutal way of looking at things, they 
try to shock the listener's conscience back into awareness.  The imagery of 
""Hand of Doom"", from the Paranoid album, is candid and condemning; it is a 
strong statement against drug addiction and rightly so...

            PUSH THE NEEDLE IN,
            FACE DEATH'S SICKLY GRIN

            IT'S TO LATE TOO TURN
            YOU DON'T WANNA LEARN
            PRICE OF LIFE YOU CRY
            NOW YOU'RE GONNA DIE
            
            
    Many people felt the group's overall direction was pessimistic and had a 
negative effect on its listener's due to that.  ""Ozzy insisted that if people 
thought he was having a bad effect on the minds of young kids, they should go 
and watch the TV news where real murder and mayhem were a way of life, and 
shown night after night."" (18)

    Sabbath was never negative in their message; they were simply truthful 
about waht they saw as wrong in the world.  If you ""Strip away the horror 
stories, the imagery and the hysteria, (and) turn down the amps a notch...you 
have a well-rehearsed, solid blues and rock band, powered by a dedication to 
well defined objectives.""  On the top of the list of those objectives was 
truth; Sabbath never feared facing that truth squarely, regardless of what many 
people thought of them.

Long, long, time ago,
I can still remember,
When the local calls were ""free"".
And I knew if I paid my bill,
And never wished them any ill,
That the phone company would let me be...

But Uncle Sam said he knew better,
Split 'em up, for all and ever!
We'll foster competition:
It's good capital-ism!

I can't remember if I cried,
When my phone bill first tripled in size.
But something touched me deep inside,
The day... Bell System... died.

And we were singing...

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

Is your office Step by Step,
Or have you gotten some Crossbar yet?
Everybody used to ask...
Oh, is TSPS coming soon?
IDDD will be a boon!
And, I hope to get a Touch-Tone phone, real soon...

The color phones are really neat,
And direct dialing can't be beat!
My area code is ""low"":
The prestige way to go!

Oh, they just raised phone booths to a dime!
Well, I suppose it's about time.
I remember how the payphones chimed,
The day... Bell System... died.

And we were singing...

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

Back then we were all at one rate,
Phone installs didn't cause debate,
About who'd put which wire where...
Installers came right out to you,
No ""phone stores"" with their ballyhoo,
And 411 was free, seemed very fair!

But FCC wanted it seems,
To let others skim long-distance creams,
No matter 'bout the locals,
They're mostly all just yokels!

And so one day it came to pass,
That the great Bell System did collapse,
In rubble now, we all do mass,
The day... Bell System... died.

So bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

I drove on out to Murray Hill,
To see Bell Labs, some time to kill,
But the sign there said the Labs were gone.
I went back to my old CO,
Where I'd had my phone lines, years ago,
But it was empty, dark, and ever so forlorn...

No relays pulsed,
No data crooned,
No MF tones did play their tunes,
There wasn't a word spoken,
All carrier paths were broken...

And so that's how it all occurred,
Microwave horns just nests for birds,
Everything became so absurd,
The day... Bell System... died.

So bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

We were singing:

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?

Copyright 1987 Bob Szekely.

    John Michael Osbourne, (known as ""Ozzy"" to his fans), has in his long 
career as vocalist for Black Sabbath had his work with the group misconstrued 
as advocating Satanism.  In a 1983 radio special featuring Ozzy, the 
interviewer expressed precisely this point; ""...Ozzy has always been shrouded 
in the darkest of Satanic imagery.  Yet if you really listen to his music, 
you'll find that what he is saying differs greatly from his image....""(1)  Even 
the group's image has often been described as ""occult and diabolic"".(2)

    The important point to remember here is to differentiate between appearance 
and reality.  Although the name ""Black Sabbath"" conjures up images of witches 
and sorcerers paying homage to Satan for the powers bestowed upon them, this 
does not make it safe to assume that the group that went by this name 
necessarily drew the inspiration from the occult.(3)  The closest they ever 
came to it was a gothic horror film featuring Boris Karloff as narrator; they 
adopted their name directly from the name of this film.(4)  Black Sabbath was 
involved in the black arts as much as Karloff practiced casting spells off-
screen.  Tony Iommi, the group's guitarist, summed it up best when he described 
the group as having basically ""...the same appeal as a horror movie.  It's all 
an act.""(5)










    Just as their film counterpart did, Ozzy and Sabbath found the occult 
mythos to be an effective vehicle for powerful social commentary; particularly 
when put in the context of heavy-metal rock and roll.  Ozzy himself noted that 
there are ""...people who pick up my [album] cover[s] and go...'This guy's got 
to be singing about Devil, doom, death and destruction.'  Which is not the 
case....""(6)

    The late Lester Bangs likened the group to Bob Dylan and William Burroughs, 
describing them all as ""...moralists...trying to deal with a serious present 
situation in an honest way....""(7)  Ozzy and Black Sabbath merely bring to 
light the many evils of our world in their work, to try and make us realize 
that we are all victim to their influence.  They hope to make us recognize 
these evils so that we may take up arms against them; a point Ozzy emphatically 
stresses:  ""...one thing everybody has got to understand about Black Sabbath's 
lyrics.  They're not downer lyrics, they're just telling everybody where it's 
at...""(8)  He also cites the group's most controversial tune, ""Black Sabbath"", 
as a response to the ignorant hippie culture still force when the tune was 
written in 1970:  ""The hippies said: 'The world is beautiful man.' (sic)  You 
only had to look around you to see how crappy it was.  It was ridiculous 
listening to that stuff, let alone playing it, so we just wrote about the world 
the way it really was and how it affected us - and we felt better in ourselves 
because we were really being honest....""(9)

        5   IS GOD JUST A THOUGHT WITHIN YOUR HEAD OR IS
        6   HE A PART OF YOU?

        24 IN WITH THE PACK WHEREVER THEY RUN

        26  AND SAY THEY MAY AS WELL WORSHIP THE SUN.

        28  THAT CRUCIFIED CHRIST

        30  ONLY ONE VOICED.
        31  WILL YOU BE SO SURE WHEN YOUR DAY IS NEAR
        32  SAY YOU DON'T BELIEVE?
        33  YOU HAD THE CHANCE BUT YOU TURNED IT DOWN
        34  NOW YOU CAN'T RETRIEVE.










    VI  35  PERHAPS YOU'LL THINK BEFORE YOU SAY THAT
        36  GOD IS DEAD AND GONE
        37  OPEN YOUR EYES, JUST REALIZE THAT HE IS THE
        38  ONE.
        39  THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN SAVE YOU KNOW FROM
        40  ALL THIS SIN AND HATE.
        41  OR WILL YOU STILL JEER AT ALL YOU HEAR?
        42  YES!-I THINK IT'S TOO LATE.

    In this piece, the group asserts a belief in an afterlife and spiritual 
redemption.  As grisly as the image of a hanged pontiff is, its shock value is 
a necessary part of the message:  They reject religious dogma, stating that a 
belief in God, in one's own heart, is the only guiding light to help one inn 
his life (lines 11/12, 39/40).  Furthermore, the reject religious hypocrisy 
(lines 5/6, 7/8) and peer pressure (verses III, IV) as excuses for not 
accepting God.  To clarify further:  following the crowd does not justify 
shrugging responsibility for one's own actions.

    After re-reading, it becomes obvious that this song is an ascerbic critique 
of atheism; (line 35/36) I refer here again to verses three and four.  In these 
two verses, the picture painted in one of Godless conformity and how it's 
viewed as being as foolish as Paganism.  These lyrics set an example for the 
listener by relating personal experience (lines 13-16).  However, for those who 
cannot accept this the group has no recourse but to condemn them, although 
rather ironically; they hope that their rhetorical loss of faith in the 
listener will open his eyes (line 42).

                NO, NO!  PLEASE--NO!!
                
                
    The all time controversy winner!  Is this not irrefutably  THE song about 
Black Magic in rock?  It's all so obvious, suffuse with evil imagery; Satan, 
walls of flame, figure in black, and damnation at the end.  Yes, I see the 
images too; it definitely concerns Black Magic.  Then again, Shakespeare's 
Macbeth employed scenes of witches involved in conjurations; does that mean 
that Shakespeare was a warlock?  Poe used to write sardonic tragedies about 
twisted murderers and the bizarre nature of acts, did that make him an evil, 
leering, demented killer?  Did either of them advocated what they wrote about?  
One has to remember that writing about something is not necessarily the same as 
emulating it.  Tony Iommi spoke out quite strongly about this:  ""People are 
bringing us down saying that we are a Black Magic group.  I think they must be










getting mixed up with Black Widow.  We don't do any sacrifices on stage, and 
we're not on a black magic kick.  We wanted to do heavy numbers and the guitar 
riffs we worked out were more suited to evil things than love.  We play songs 
about black magic, but they are more likely to be against than for it.""(12)  

    By now, you're probably asking yourself who Black Widow is, right?  Then 
it's time for a little history:

        Sabbath, before they were known as Sabbath, had the same line-up but 
two earlier names.  The first one was Polka Tulk, which seemed sure to doom 
them to obscurity.(13)  The soon realized this and changed the group's name to 
Earth.  Now, Earth was a blues band at the end of the English blues boom.  As 
if that wasn't bad enough, they soon discovered that not only was there another 
group named Earth, but they had also released a single.  To avoid confusion, 
they changed their name again.(14)  But what made them decide on that name?  
Just ask Ozzy:  ""I just liked the name Black Sabbath because of the succession 
of vowel sounds.(15)  If that sounds ludicrous just consider this:  Sabbath was 
""...the first of the really committed, loud and heavy bands...""(16)  They 
needed a name to match the gut-wrenching power they were developing.  Tony knew 
that he wanted Sabbath to be noticed above all the rest of the British blues 
bands:  ""We wanted something of our own that we'd like and people would like.  
And we wanted something loud!""










    Tony didn't hate the blues.  He'd cut his teeth as a guitarist on the likes 
of The Shadows, Buddy Holly and Django Rheinhardt, developing his own style 
from there.  But he realized the group had no future in the blues:

        'We couldn't keep playing 12-bars forever.  We just got fed up with 
Earth music.  It was jazz, blues stuff.  It was good for practice but nothing 
else.'

    In the late 'Sixties, blues groups were a dime a dozen in Birmingham and 
interest was waning in the blues boom due to the glut of groups.  One man, by 
the name of Jim Simpson, had heard Earth around the Birmingham club circuit and 
understood what they were trying to do.  He decided to take them under his 
wing.  With the aid of his massive record collection, Jim expanded the group's 
horizons in the areas of jazz and blues.  He introduced them to artists like 
Wes Montgomery, Count Basie and Jimmy Rushing.  It was from Rushing in 
particular that they derived the repetitive riff style so readily noticeable in 
their later incarnation as Black Sabbath.

    The Count Basie influence is evidenced in the song ""Wicked World"" from the 
first album; Sabbath drummer Bill Ward uses a ""'sighing hi-hat'...in the manner 
of Basie's drummer Jo Jones.""










    The influence is subtle, almost subliminal.  Yet it is one which was not 
thought capable of hard, 'heavy' rock bands in the late 'Sixties.  Although Led 
Zeppelin and Jimi Hendrix also had their work steeped in blues and jazz 
derivations (Hendrix' ""Third Stone From the Sun"" and Zeppelin's version of 
Willie Dixon's ""I Can't Quit You Baby"" from their first album), neither was 
able to match the intense energy of Black Sabbath.  Iommi has always had a 
preference for music with an original, distinct style of its' own; as an 
example, he mentions guitarists Joe Pass and Alvin Lee as two of his strongest 
songwriting influences.

    It would also be necessary that Sabbath develop a unique, distinctive style 
and image of their own.  Though they had changed their name from Earth to Black 
Sabbath to avoid confusion with the other Earth; at the same time another group 
emerged by the name of Black Widow ""...who WERE profoundly influenced by the 
occult, had a male witch as a patron, and wrote pieces like ""Come to The 
Sabbat.""  Unfortunately, Sabbath was constantly reaping the benefits of Widow's 
publicity.

    Sabbath was a group that never minced words.  If they saw something as 
destructive, they would be sure to rub the listener's face it it.  They did not 
want their point to be missed.

    With their straightforward, sometimes brutal way of looking at things, they 
try to shock the listener's conscience back into awareness.  The imagery of 
""Hand of Doom"", from the Paranoid album, is candid and condemning; it is a 
strong statement against drug addiction and rightly so...

    Many people felt the group's overall direction was pessimistic and had a 
negative effect on its listener's due to that.  ""Ozzy insisted that if people 
thought he was having a bad effect on the minds of young kids, they should go 
and watch the TV news where real murder and mayhem were a way of life, and 
shown night after night."" (18)

    Sabbath was never negative in their message; they were simply truthful 
about waht they saw as wrong in the world.  If you ""Strip away the horror 
stories, the imagery and the hysteria, (and) turn down the amps a notch...you 
have a well-rehearsed, solid blues and rock band, powered by a dedication to 
well defined objectives.""  On the top of the list of those objectives was 
truth; Sabbath never feared facing that truth squarely, regardless of what many 
people thought of them.

Long, long, time ago,
I can still remember,
When the local calls were ""free"".
And I knew if I paid my bill,
And never wished them any ill,
That the phone company would let me be...

But Uncle Sam said he knew better,
Split 'em up, for all and ever!
We'll foster competition:
It's good capital-ism!

I can't remember if I cried,
When my phone bill first tripled in size.
But something touched me deep inside,
The day... Bell System... died.

And we were singing...

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

Is your office Step by Step,
Or have you gotten some Crossbar yet?
Everybody used to ask...
Oh, is TSPS coming soon?
IDDD will be a boon!
And, I hope to get a Touch-Tone phone, real soon...

The color phones are really neat,
And direct dialing can't be beat!
My area code is ""low"":
The prestige way to go!

Oh, they just raised phone booths to a dime!
Well, I suppose it's about time.
I remember how the payphones chimed,
The day... Bell System... died.

And we were singing...

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

Back then we were all at one rate,
Phone installs didn't cause debate,
About who'd put which wire where...
Installers came right out to you,
No ""phone stores"" with their ballyhoo,
And 411 was free, seemed very fair!

But FCC wanted it seems,
To let others skim long-distance creams,
No matter 'bout the locals,
They're mostly all just yokels!

And so one day it came to pass,
That the great Bell System did collapse,
In rubble now, we all do mass,
The day... Bell System... died.

So bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

I drove on out to Murray Hill,
To see Bell Labs, some time to kill,
But the sign there said the Labs were gone.
I went back to my old CO,
Where I'd had my phone lines, years ago,
But it was empty, dark, and ever so forlorn...

No relays pulsed,
No data crooned,
No MF tones did play their tunes,
There wasn't a word spoken,
All carrier paths were broken...

And so that's how it all occurred,
Microwave horns just nests for birds,
Everything became so absurd,
The day... Bell System... died.

So bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

We were singing:

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?

But she's good enough for me.         So he's good enough for me!

Shall we sing in praise of Loki,      It was good enough for Odin

But he's good enough for me.          But it's good enough for me.

              The savior of the human ra-aa-ace.
              She invented Imperium Compound,
              Most effacatious in evr'y case.

   There was Horic, We thought he was sick,
   As a War-Puppy he was insane,
   Gave up Tranya for Imperium Compound,
   Now we have an Acid Reign!            //Oh wow, man!//   (18)

   This song'll bedevil the folks at a revel,
   And most of the time it will annoy the King,
   So take a drink of Imperium Compound
   And let's go Royalty-bedeviling!                         (5)

   Duchess Anna is quite a fan-a
   Going on a wartime shopping spree!  \\ War Point!\\
   Took a drink of Imperium Compound
   And shopped so fast we couldn't see! \\ Z-o-o-o-om!\\    (5)

   Lyn of Whitewolfe, made of the right stuff,
   Twice the Queen of Atenveldt;
   Took a drink of Imperium Compound
   And the Kingdom of Caid before her knelt!                (5)

   Duke Sir Brion, and Duke Sir Trelon,
   Won the Crown with regularity;
   Drank a lot of Imperium Compound,
   And founded a dynasty!                                   (5)

   Stephan von Geist, was most awful nice,
   And a chivalrous fighter without any doubt
   Took a swig of Imperium Compound
   And won the Crown his first time out!                    (5)

   All the Crusadenes were big, but not mean,
   And the finest fighters in the town.
   But they all drank Jerusalem Compound,
   Winning Crown after Crown after Crown!                   (5)

   Good Duke Arthur couldn't get no farth-er
   A Norman King in Aten Land
   Drank too much of Imperium Compound
   And went off to conquer Engel-land!                      (5)

   Then King Richard, a bit of a bitch, heard
   A King's Crown could be done.
   Drank a little Imperium Compound
   And became the Aten King, first one!                     (5)
11
   There was Astra, no one ever asked her
   And she was for having fun!
   Then she sampled Imperium Compound,
   And today she is a nun   \\ not better!\\               (19)

   There's good old Igor, his prowess is meager
   For he never learned to water-ski!
   But instead he drinks Imperium Compound
   Then he howls and climbs a tree!  \\Hoo Hah!\\          (19)

   Then there's Dagan, his brother's the Ka-Khan,
   Which is quite funny in a King!
   If he gets hooked on Imperium Compound
   There'll be new songs to sing!    \\ Oh, really?\\       (19)  

   Fredrick of Holland, who dwells in the Northland,
   A Master from the West, he came!
   Spends all his money for Imperium Compound
   That's why his garb's always the same!                   (20)

   Now Gyrth Oldcastle, round as a beer barrel,
   Once chose to quarrel with a certain Bard;
   The poet served him with Imperium Compound,
   And left him rendered down to lard!                      (20)

   Many tales abound of Imperium Compound
   And its' strange effects on Royalty,
   But after an hour, this song has no power,
   And by now, it's boring ME!                             (16)

   Duchess Malinda, who doesn't do windas
   But she does a lot of Duchess Things,
   But give her a LOT of Imperium Compound,
   And she sings and sings and sings and sings and sings!   (5)

   AltChorus: Oh it's too long, too long, too long
              To sing the whole song, the song, the song
              Longer than a Royal Court, it is!
              But sing it serial, this ditty Imperial
              And you'll be a bardic whiz!                 (5)

                                             IMPERIUM COMPOUND    
                                             (Atenveldt Verses)

   Now here's a story, a little bit gory,
   A little bit happy, a little bit sad.
   About a drink called Imperium Compound
   And how the SCA's been had!                       

   Chorus: Oh we think, we think, we think,
           The King is a fink, a fink, a fink,
           A figure of respectability
           Rules the Kingdom thru Imperium Compound
           The results are plain to see!

   Mongol Hordemen, those free-living swordsmen
   Subverting the Kingdoms from underneath!
   Have no use for Imperium Compound
   Except perhaps to brush their teeth!

   AltChorus: Oh we fink, we fink, we fink,
              The Khan and the Kink, the Kink, the Kink,
              And the Board, their Great Senilities!
              The Western Irgun, drinks Imperium Compound
              And we're BACK, with results you'll see!    

   Lady Laurel, with Authority Royal,
   Passes and rejects our heraldry
   She needs a swig of Imperium Compound
   Then perhaps she'd deign to talk to me!            

   Lady Trude thought it her duty
   To turn a social wrong into a Right
   Proved her point with Imperium Compound
   And showed that Cheshire Cats can fight!  //and scratch//

   The Board of Directors styled themselves The Electors
   And another con they tried to swing
   Now the BoD drinks Imperium Compound
   So we no longer need a King!                        

   AltChorus: Oh the Bod, the BoD, the BoD,
              It thinks it is God, is God, is God,
              The figure of Supreme Authority!
              And if we O.D.'d on Imperium Compund
              there'd be no need for Royalty!          

   Oh, MEDIEVAL Net, we thought it was all wet
   With witty remarks, and other kinds of sass
   We'll feed our computers on Imperium Compound
   And BYTE the BoD right on its' righteous ass!         

   Good old Duncan was often drunken
   Chasing all the ladies fair
   He bathed himself in Imperium Compound
   Now he has a little savoir faire!                     

                    (more)


  ATEN IMPERIUM (cont.)

   Ioseph of Locksley, never changes his socks, he
   Runs around looking like a Cavalier,
   He stocked up on Imperium Compound
   And he has enough to last for years and years!        

   AltChorus: Oh they forgot, forgot, forgot
              The Locks-e-ly Plot, the Plot, the Plot!
              And it works the best when it is underground!
              It isn't a hassle for a green-and-white tassle
              They're the ones that BREW Imperium Compound!  

   Trelon of the Wood, he was very good, he
   Was a leader that had never been beat before;
   But Caid had Imperium Compound,
   And Imperial Roman Caid won the War!  //with help!//   

   In Tyr Ysgithr, it's regularly whispered there
   That the Kingdom is ruled over by a King    // What's THAT? //
   They're ""democratic"" and quite erratic....
   They've forgot the purpose of the whole damn thing!     

   King Sir Mark von, with his pretty white suit on,
   Rules the Kingdom both with Grace and Purity!
   He never touches Imperium Compound
   At least not where anyone else can see!               

   Duke Sir Deaton, was never beaten
   On the field, or in the drinking hall;
   At the Catbox War with Caid,
   Left thirty bodies piled against the wall!             

   Denis O'Titans was good at smitin'
   A Locksley Monster in every single way!
   Drank a little Imperium Compound
   And ATE Deaton's sword that day  // No! REALLY! //       

   Wotan the Mongoloid, a little bit paranoid,
   But a nice guy none the less;
   Drank a mess of Imperium Compound
   Now he's Justin du Roc, I confess!                       

   Then there's Duke Reynard, with a face like a St. Bernard
   Of the Dukes, he is the homliest
   He tends to toke up on Imperium Compound
   And go out and whomp on anybody's best!                   

   This song'll bedevil the folks at a revel,
   And most of the time it will annoy the King,
   So take a drink of Imperium Compound
   And let's go Royalty-bedeviling!                        

   Duchess Anna is quite a fan-a
   Going on a wartime shopping spree!  \\ War Point!\\
   Took a drink of Imperium Compound
   And shopped so fast we couldn't see! \\ Z-o-o-o-om!\\    (5)

   Duke Sir Brion, with his pretty white suit on,
   Is a model of goodness and purity
   Never touches Imperium Compound
(spoken:) And I'll sell ya seashore property in Yuma, too!  

   Optional last verse:

   Many tales abound of Imperium Compound
   And its' strange effects on Royalty,
   But after an hour, this song has no power,
   And by now, it's boring ME!

                copyright 1984 W. J. Bethancourt III
                recorded: CELTIC CIRCLE DANCE
                          WTP-0002C

        Last night I had the strangest dream in this bleak century
        I dreamed that people the world around believed in Chivalry

        I dreamed I saw a Kingly Crown enshrined in laurel leaves
        with Grace and Joy and Purity attendant at his feet

        I dreamed I saw the perfect Knight receive his accolade
        and minstrels sang and children laughed in some soft forest glade

        I dreamed I saw the finest thing that ever man could make
        grow great and strong and undefiled: Pray God I never wake!

        Last night I had the strangest dream in this bleak century
        I dreamed that people the world around believed in Chivalry

               (to the tune of ""Good King Wenceslaus"")

                Locksley Monsters never yield
                on the field of battle
                strike the helm and bash the shield
                make their eyeteeth rattle
                Bodies on the ground will lie
                bones will burst in sunder
                search for Locksleys' enemies:
                You'll find them six feet under!

                              SONG OF IVANOF

            There is a man who we know well that does the best he can
            but he's displayed in armour made of reticulated garbage cans!

            He looks so fine and fair and strong, oh how he plays the man
            and how it's prized, those galvanized, reticulated garbage cans

            The noblest Roman of them all, a good Praetorian
            a combatant who wears no pants, judst reticulated garbage cans!

            Like old Horatius at the Bridge, like the Legions of Valerian
            (O dearie me: those LOVELY knees!)
            and those reticulated garbage cans!

                         C. McCray Bethancourt

         (sung to the tune (obviously) of the 12 Days of Christmas)


1.           The first time I sent my device, The Heralds said to me

            ""It violates the Rule of Three""

2.           The next time I tried it, the Heralds said to me

            ""We changed the forms, and it violates the Rule of
             Three"".

3.           The third time I tried, and the Heralds said to me, 

            ""We upped the fees, we changed the forms, and it
             violates the Rule of Three"".

4.           Another time I tried and the Heralds said to me,
 
            ""We haven't got it, we upped the fees, we changed the 
             forms, and it violates the Rule of Three"".

5.           The fifth time I tried it, the Heralds said to me,  

            ""In a decision rendered by the College of Arms on
             August 1st, A.S. V it was decided that this style of
             heraldic design was not appropriate to the aims and 
             intentions of the Corporate Body. Holy! Holy! Holy! ""

 note: verse 5 is delivered in an extremely fast, mono-
       tone, similiar to a Gregorian Chant.

           "" ....we haven't got it, we upped the fees, we changed the forms,
             and it violates the Rule of Three.""

6.           I tried it a sixth time, and the Heralds said to me,

            ""We changed the rules, &c""

7.           A seventh time I tried and, the Heralds said to me,

            ""It's against the Rule of Tincture, we changed the
             rules, &c""

8.           I tried it once again and the heralds said to me,

            ""It's not a Period design, It's against the Rule of Tincture, We
             changed the rules, &c""

                                * more *



    Heralds Said To Me (cont.)

9.           I sent it in once more, and the Heralds said to me,

            ""We changed the rules again, It's not a Period design,
             it's against the Rule of Tincture, we changed the
             rules, &c""

10. (sung in cold anger)
             The LAST time I sent my device, the Heralds said to me

    (sung in a state of SMUG)
             ""Someone else has got it, &c""




              (nb: every single one of these reasons has been used by the
              CoA, at one point or another, to reject perfectly good
              heraldry, along with some even MORE stupid.  If the shoe 
              fits....................!!!!!!!!)

                        BUGS ON THE BARONESS
                        Tune: Waltzing Matilda
 
           or: Who was that Vermin I saw you with last, Knight?
   or: There may be Lice on all you Knice, but there ain't no Lice on me

           Once there was a Barony howling in the wilderness
           nestled in the Valley where the River doesn't flow
           and the folks were driven buggy by the insects in the Revel Hall
           Authenticity is wonderful, but this doesn't go!

                   Bugs on the Baroness, bugs on the Baroness!
                   That was the cry that you heard all the day
                   and the scratching can be heard from Ysgithr to Ered Sul
                   why did we come here? Let's go away!

           See them all a scratching, nestled in their armour tight
           the fleas have a melee team that's challenging the field!
           call Truly Nolen! Someone's gotta help us out!
           the crabs are nesting in our helms but we'll never yield!

                   (chorus)

           Dawn comes a-breaking, the bugs have won the Coronet...
           flea-infested Conan-clones in piles upon the lawn
           where is the Barony? The bugs have eaten everyone...
           termites got the stick-jocks, and all their sticks are gone!

                   (chorus)

                          ATENVELDT
                          tune: The West's Awake

                  For all the Lands where I have dwelt
                  Oh Atenveldt, Oh Atenveldt
                  till rivers burn and mountains melt
                  lest I forget my Atenveldt
                  From deserts stark to snow-capped peaks
                  from silent lakes and laughing creeks
                  sing: Oh let man find his heart's ease
                  on rocky plains
                  in desert breeze

                  For oft I thought of mighty men
                  who carved a Land with sword and pen
                  and lit a candle, burning bright,
                  that pierced the darkness; stirred the night!
                  tho some are gone their deeds remain
                  this sunny Crown without a stain
                  sing: Oh, their deeds were not in vain!
                  in sunlit days
                  and falling rain.....

                  So raise your banners, blazoned bright
                  Advance the Dream and Shine the Light!
                  in battle's crash and Revel's song
                  raise high the Flag and wave it long!
                  For all the Lands wherein I've dwelt
                  I love you best, my Atenveldt!

      What the use of wearing panties
      whalebone corsets of your Auntie's
      boxer shorts and other scanties
      best of all is nude
      there's such fun in going bra-less
      now that it's no longer lawless
      'specially if your figure's flawless
      best of all is nude
      nude is what you're born in
      shirts are never torn in
      underwear and lacy flimsies, garter belts and other whimsies
      yards of itchy cloth to put your form in
      ducks all do it, maidens rue it
      even ancient Picts in Britain blue it
      going naked's how to do it
      best of all is nude!

      If your garters aren't elastic
      tie them up in knots fantastic
      (panty hose is something drastic!)
      best of all is nude!
      If you're tired of wearing clotheses
      shed your garment 'mongst the roses
      never mind the old bluenoses
      best of all is nude!
      Nude is best for ducking!
      Worst for horses bucking!
      Moonlit nights will see such sights
          that are very best for fooling round
                              .....and elbows!
      Nudity is grand to see
       a well-known antidote to virginity
      take your clothes off and you'll see:
      best of all is nude!

                   once I talked to a great Grey Man
                   spun three times and said with a sigh
                   hadn't been for the Runes had his other eye!

                   prettiest thing I've ever seen
                   she went down underneath the hill
                   and came back out of her own free will

                   Brian Boru, on Irish ground
                   walked three times the Island round
                   Norsemen came lookin for a fight
                   just another Irish Saturday night!

                   Hi said Lugh on the banquest night
                   a poet and a player and a good wheelwright
                   a harper and a warrior and none the least:
                   a Druid and he got in to the Feast!

                   Harold Haardrada's face was red!
                   Came to Britain and he wound up dead
                   Stamford Bridge is where he's found
                   got six feet of English ground

                   the Legion with it's Eagles bright
                   marched into the Pictish night
                   met them there upon the sand
                   gave em up to the Wicker Man!

                   eight-legged steed and hound of Hel
                   the one-eyed Man, he loves ya well
                   fire burn and fire spark
                   are you then feared of the dark?

                   The Circle forms, the Circle flows
                   the Circle goes where no man knows
                   Hail to the Lady, one in three:
                   Present is Past and Past is Me!

                   Rhiannon's Birds are still in flight
                   all thru the Day all thru the Night

                   Hi said the Lady dressed in white
                   sang the Day and sang the Night
                   sang the Land and sang the Sea
                   sang the Song, and then sang Me!

                                  came the Lady to the lea
                                  Sword and Roses in Her Hand
                                  spread their seeds thruout the Land

                                  saw the Lady where she stood
                                  by the fire burning bright
                                  came to know his heart's delight!

                    WEAPONS AT THE DOOR

 Being a Polemic concerning the alleged Custom of the West Kingdom concerning 
 checking your Weapons at the Door of the Revel Hall. As the Satire is the 
 Weapon of the Bard, this said Polemic is to be checked at the Door, along with 
 swords, knives, redheaded Ladies and other such Deadly Things.....

         As I roved out to Western Lands to take the Western Air
         I went into a Revel Hall and I saw a Twelfth Night there
         but I was halted at the gate by a Privy Consellor
                 (that's the man who tells the King of the West how to go to
                  the bath room!)
         who told me I would have to check my Weapons at the door

         As I, in my astonishment, stood hung on tenter-pegs
         a Knight came in whose Prouess hung down between his legs
         the Doorman grabbed a greatsword and he struck the Knight full sore
         and gave him a reciept; he left his weapon at the door!

         a Bard was next whose goodly Voice has entertained us all
         but he, too, was prevented from entering the Hall
         and told he could not carry deadly weapons on the floor
         he left his Voice and Harp among the weapons at the door

         a Master entered graciously, a man we all know well
         who holds a 3rd Dan Black Belt, tho this he'd never tell
         the Master struggled valiantly, the Master cursed and swore
         but he left his hands, and feet, as weapons at the door

         the company was jovial, altho a bit dismayed
         for lack of proper cutlery, down to the smallest blade
         for even teeth and fingernails, each can be used in War
         were cut, and pulled, and left behind, as weapons at the door!

         And has their King not loyal Knights that He must be afraid
         of brawling in his Hall and of Assassin's bloody blade?
         the Rights of Men to carry Arms at least WE'VE not foreswore
         and a POX on them that made the Rule of Weapons at the Door!

                           THE STREETS OF ANN ARBOR

               As I walked out thru the streets of Ann Arbor
               as I walked out thru Ann Arbor one day
               I spied a young Mongol all dressed in white linen
               all dressed in white linen and cold as the clay

               I then spied another, done in on the sidewalk
               along with just about six dozen more
               their wounds were all gaping, from mace and from braoadsword
               from claymore and cannon, all dripping with gore

               what caused this grave carnage, I cried to the Monglos
               oh pray what's the reason for this awful sight
               my answer came slowly from under the corpse-pile
               ""It seems that our bark is much worse than our bite.....""

               the answer continued from pale lips a-shaking
               we sang all our songs and believed them as true
               the Dark Horde could never be beaten in battle
               we thought this was what all good Mongols could do...

               we went down to Atenveldt all for to plunder
               ""too large to defend"" was our song every night
               but Atenveldt's different from East, West or Middle
               there, even the bushes have learned how to bite!

               the Clann stole our ponies, the Scraelings our foodstuffs
               we ran into axes in AtenViking hands
               our maidens ran off with one Richard of Arkham
               and we're all that's left to return to our lands

               MacChluarains and Monsters, Lockehaven and Foxmoor
               that Kingdom is BIG and its' fighters are MEAN!
               we fought and we lost, and fled back to Ann Arbor
               we all came back home with results that you've seen

               keep away from that Land with its' cactus and marshes
               it's no place for Mongols who are bent on War
               they count their blows well, but they strick them yet better
               he crawled into his Yurt, and fell, dead, on the floor.....

       tune: the song of the Cowardly Lion, Tin Woodsman and Scarecrow
             in the movie version of the Wizard of Oz

        (Enter the Scarecrow, who singeth:)

        My wife is always nagging; my Prowess it is lagging
        I can't do anything
        she has got a reason, but revenge is out of season
        Oh I wish I could be King!

        If I just had the Crown on, I'd always have a frown on
        and the Barons on a string
        Heads they would be rolling, the Board would be cajoling
        Oh if only I was King!

        I am very fed up with the way this group is set up
        Oh I'd change everything!
        they are so high and mighty with the way that they do fight-ey
        Oh, someday I'll be King!

        Tho my wife is melancholic, and very...vitriolic
        she's a wasp without a sting!
        I'd have to supervise her with a pack of tranquilizers
        If I only was a King......

        (the Tin Woodsman joineth him, and singeth:)

        I grew up kind of cocky, and rather big, and stocky
        and straight as any rod
        on the field I'm a battallion, with the Ladies I'm a stallion
        ...Oh they'd better make me God!

        The other boys are jealous they say I'm over-zealous
        they'd do better to applaud
        the things that I am giving to this Dream that we are living
        oh I wish they'd make me God!

        They say that I'm conceited, but I'm just badly treated
        by people and by BoD
        just think of what they're missing by My Majesty dismissing
        Oh they'd better make me God!

        (the Cowardly Lion creepeth forth, and singeth:)

        Oh I could be a fighter, a great and mighty smiter
        and be the perfect knight
        it's a great and nasty shame, and everyone's to blame
        oh I wish that I could fight!

        Song of the Three (cont.)

        I could be a Cavalier drinking wine and ale and beer
        and be a gorgeous sight
        but it would cost me too much money so it isn't very funny
        oh I wish that I could fight!                               

        Let me at 'em on the field, I would surely make them yield
        to my Power and my Might
        with rattan, shinai and rapier they would nevermore escape here
        If they'd only let me fight

                      by William Poundstone
                              1983

     Two mentalities are at work here: 1960s rock fans and 1980s
fundamentalist Christians. The idea of phonographically concealed
messages dates from the Paul McCartney death scare of 1969. For
hard-core types, the secret-message rumors never really died. Avid
rock fans have auditioned ever album release since the late 1960s
for hidden nuances. Backward messages, barely audible messages,
and messages on one stereo track only have been alleged. At the
other end of the sociosensual spectrum, fundamentalist Christians
have gotten into the act. TV programs such as PRAISE THE LORD and
THE 700 CLUB have propagated rumors of a satanic plot in the
recording industry, no less, in which various albums conceal
""backward-masked"" demonic murmurings. If THAT sounds too spacey to
be taken seriously, consider that it was the fundamentalist groups
who were behind House Resolution 6363, a bill introduced in the
U.S. House of Representatives by Robert K. Dornan (R., Calif.) in
1982 to label all suspect records: ""WARNING: THIS RECORD CONTAINS
BACKWARD MASKING THAT MAKES A VERBAL STATEMENT WHICH IS AUDIBLE
WHEN THIS RECORD IS PLAYED BACKWARD AND WHICH MAY BE PERCEPTIBLE
AT A SUBLIMINAL LEVEL WHEN THIS RECORD IS PLAYED FORWARD."" In
February 1983, the Arkansas State Senate passed a similar record-
labeling bill by a vote of 86 to 0.
     Contributing to the quasi-occult status of these rumors is
the difficulty of checking them out on home audio equipment. You
pretty much have to take someone else's word for it, or dismiss
the rumors out of hand.
     From a technical standpoint, there are four simple ways to
conceal a verbal message on a recording. The most obvious is to
record the message at a very low volume. The message may then be
recovered by turning the volume up while playing the record or
tape. If the message is faint enough, though, noise levels of home
equipment may garble it. If the accompanying music or lyrics are
loud enough, or if the message itself is indistinct or
electronically modified, it may be hard to hear on any equipment.
     A second gimmick is to record a message on one stereo track
only. Records and tapes have two independent recordings, of
course, normally played simultaneously for stereo effect. On a
record, each stereo track occupies on one side of the V-shaped
groove for the needle. On a tape, the tracks are recorded in
parallel lanes of the magnetic material. The two tracks are called
""right"" and ""left"" after the stereo speakers they will play on.
Otherwise, the tracks are interchangeable -- the sound mixer can
put anything he or she wants on each track. A message on one track
can be masked by simultaneous loud music or lyrics on the opposite
track. With normal stereo balance (or mono equipment) the loud
track drowns out the message track. At home, single-track messages
can be recovered by adjusting the stereo balance so that only the
desired track plays. Sometimes this trick also makes indistinct
words clearer. Even if the words are not exclusively on one track,
they may happen to be more audible on one track.
     A message could be recorded at a speed different from the
rest of the record. Then the record would have to be played faster
or slower than usual to recover the message. Unless the message
was at one of the standard speeds (say, 45 rpm on a 33 1/3 rpm
record), it could not be played normally on home equipment.
     The fourth and most commonly alleged trick is to record a
verbal message backward. Reversed speech has several unexpected
features. One is that syllables are not a constant in the reversal
process. A one-syllable word can have two or three syllables when
played backward. Thus ""number nine"" in the Beatles' REVOLUTION 9
reverses to ""Turn me on, dead man"" (or something like it), a jump
from three to five syllables.
     There is no simple way to predict what a word or phrase will
sound like reversed. Obviously, you can't just reverse the
letters.
     Reversed messages are difficult to recover at home. Record
turntables are not built to go backwards. Some have a neutral
setting, in which the pickup and amplifier remain active and you
can turn the record backward by hand. But hardly anyone has a
stead enough hand to produce satisfactory results.
     With patience, it is possible to reverse a cassette
recording. Transfer the music from the original record or tape
onto a blank tape cassette. Place the cassette flat on a table.
Draw our the part of the tape with the suspected message and snip
it off at both ends. Hold the tape segment horizontally. Rotate it
180 degrees, keep it horizontal at all times. This turns the tape
end for end. Splice the reversed tape segment back onto the two
loose ends of the cassette with strong adhesive tape. Reel the
tape back inside the cassette. The sliced segment will play
backward on an ordinary cassette player.
     I rented a recording studio to test the secret-message
rumors. New copiies of the records in question were transcribed on
a quarter-inch master tape. Where rumor alleged that a single
stereo track contained a message, right and left stereo tracks
were transcribed separately. Records with alleged inaudible
messages were treated similarly. To test claims of reversed
messages, recordings on the master tape were edited out and
spliced in backward. Twenty cuts or portions of cuts from sixteen
albums were tested.


""Another One Bites the Dust""
Queen, THE GAME

Rumor: When played backward, the lyrics say, ""It's fun to smoke
marijuana.""
Findings: There is something that sounds like ""It's fun to smoke
marijuana"" in the reversed music. It is repeated over and over. It
might be rendered no less faithfully, however, as ""sfun to scout
mare wanna."" This ""message"" is the reversal of the song title,
which is repeated as a line in the song.
     Let's make a distinction between engineered and phonetic
reversals. When an artist records a verbal statement, reverses it
by turning the tape end for end, mixes the reversed statement onto
a master tape, and has records and tapes produced from the master,
that is an engineered reversal. When the phonetic properties of
song lyrics are such that they can be reversed to sound like
something else, that is a phonetic reversal.
     ""It's fun to smoke marijuna"" is clearly a phonetic reversal.
The lyrics are perfectly plain played forward (""Another one bites
the dust""), no so plain played backward (""sfun to scout mare
wanna""). With an engineered reversal, the opposite should hold
true: gibberish forward, clear as a bell backward. Some are
prepared to believe that phonetic reversals are just as
intentional as engineered reversals -- that the songwriter
painstakinginly planned the phonetic double-entendre. In the
absence of confirming evidence, that just doesn't wash. It's too
easy to find coincidences. If, for example, the letters of the
alphabet are recited in conventional fashion (Ay, Bee, Cee, etc.)
and reversed, at least five sound like English language words. D
reverses to ""eden,"" F becomes ""pray,"" S becomes ""say,"" V becomes
""even,"" and Z becomes ""easy."" ""It's fun to smoke marijuana"" is
likewise a coincidence.


""A Child is Coming""
Jefferson Starship, BLOWS AGAINST THE EMPIRE

Rumor: When played backward, ""son of Satan.""
Findings: Another phonetic coincidence. The repeated ""It's getting
better"" reverses to an iffy ""son of Satan,"" the ""of"" drawn out and
the ""Satan"" strongly accented on the first syllable.


""Eldorado""
Electric Light Orchestra, ELDORADO

Rumor: When played backward, ""He is the nasty one/ Christ, you're
infernal/ It is said we're dead men/ Everyone who has the mark
will live.""
Findings: Coincidence. The supposed message lurks around the line
""On a voyage of no return to see."" Reversed, this passage becomes
the expected syllable salad -- no one hearing it would describe it
as anything but reversed music. Only if you listen while reading
along with what you're supposed to hear will you get anything. The
rumored version of the message is somewhat fudged. The passage
sounds more like ""He's to nasty one/ Christ you are, Christ,
you're fernal/ There wiss uh, we're dead men..."" There is no ""in""
in what is taken to be ""infernal."" The line that is supposed to be
""Everyone who has the mark will live"" isn't even close, though the
syllable count is right.


""Shoo Be Doo""
The Cars, CANDY-O

Rumor: When played backward, the word ""Satan"" repeated
approximately eleven times.
Findings: Coincidence. The rumor refers to the reversal of the ""Shoo
be doo, shoo be doo, shoo be doo..."" near the end of the song. Given
the mysterious logic of reversed phonemes, these three-syllable units
can be hard as a repeated two-syllable word. The word sounds a little
like ""Satan.""


""Snowblind""
Styx, PARADISE THEATER

Rumor: According to a mimeographed list of suspect records distributed
by Congressman Dornan, the words ""Satan move through our voices"" when
played backwards.
Findings: Negative. Despite repeated listenings, it was not even
possible to identify the part of the reversed track that Dornan et al.
are talking about.


""Stairway to Heaven""
Led Zeppelin, untitled, a.k.a. STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN

Rumor: In reverse, ""I live for Satan... The Lord turns me off...
There's no escaping it... Here's to my sweet Satan... There's power in
Satan... He will give you 666.""
Findings: Coincidence. If you listen very carefully to the ""And it
makes me wonder"" lines in reverse, you'll hear something approaching
""There's no escaping it."" A better description is ""There's no escape
do."" Knock of the last syllable, and you have ""There's no escape,"" a
complete, intelligible sentence in reverse. It's there, all right, but
it's not an unlikely enough coincidence to -- well, make you wonder.
      The ""Satan"" in ""I live for Satan"" is good and clear. The ""I live
for"" part isn't. The other alleged lines are unremarkable. All are
phonetic reversals of the entirely lucid forward lyrics and obviously
just accidents.


""When Electricity Came to Arkansas""
Black Oak Arkansas, BLACK OAK ARKANSAS and RONCH AND ROLL

Rumor: In reverse, ""Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan. He is God. He
is God.""
Findings: The BLACK OAK ARKANSAS cut was reversed. Again, pairs of
reversed syllables are being freely interpreted as ""Satan."" ""He is
God"" was not identifiable.


""Rain""
The Beatles, HEY JUDE

Rumor: Unintelligible lyrics at the end are reversed.
Findings: A true engineered reversal and not really a secret. ""Rain""
seems to have been the first popular recording to incorporate an
obviously reversed lyric. The story is that John Lennon accidentally
spliced the last part of the song in backward and liked the effect.
When reversed, the strange-sounding vocals at the end become
intelligible as a reprise starting with the drawn-out word
""sunshine.""
      The reversal is less apparent to the casual listener than it
might be because the accompanying music is not reversed. The ending
fits in smoothly with the rest of the song, the vocals suggesting a
foreign language.


""Fire on High""
Electric Light Orchestra, FACE THE MUSIC

Rumor: When played backward, ""The music is reversible, but time --
turn back!""
Findings: ""Fire on High"" is instrumental. About twenty-six seconds
into the music, scrambled speech is heard. It is mostly louder than
the accompanying music and begins with a two-syllable unit repeated
several times. The seeming speech lasts for about fourteen seconds.
      Reversing the music confirms that there is a true, engineered
message. In reverse, a voice (Jeff Lynne's?) says, ""The music is
reversible, but time -- turn back! Turn back! Turn back! Turn back!""
All the words are clear and unambiguous. Anyone comparing this to the
alleged reversal on ELO's ""Eldorado"" will have no trouble telling
which is genuine.


""Goodbye Blue Sky""
Pink Floyd, THE WALL

Rumor: In reverse, ""You have discovered the secret message.""
Findings: The ""secret message"" is at the very end of the instrumental
passage following the ""Goodbye Blue Sky"" vocals. It comes just before
the words ""What shall we do"" at the start of the song that is
identified as ""Empty Spaces"" on the record label and as ""What shall we
do now?"" on the record sleeve. Played forward, the message is less
apparent than the FACE THE MUSIC reversal: A reasonably attentive
listener might play THE WALL through and not catch it. It suggests
speech not quite close enough to be overheard. In context this is not
unusual because the ""Goodbye Blue Sky"" instrumental passage includes
""airport noises"" and other sound effects. A loud climax in the music
further masks the unintelligible voice.
      When played backward, the voice (Roger Waters?) plainly intones,
""Congratulations, you have just discovered the secret message. Please
send your answer to old Pink, care of the funny farm..."" As the voice
fades out, there may be another word -- perhaps ""Chalfonte or
""Chelsea"" -- after ""funny farm.""


""Heavy Metal Poisoning""
Styx, KILROY WAS HERE

Rumor: A red sticker on the KILROY WAS HERE cover warns, ""By order of
the Majority for Musical Morality, this album contains secret backward
messages...""
Findings: This is a case of second-generation backward-masking. Styx'
PARADISE THEATER did not contain a backward message, though a lot of
people said it did. So Styx has included a sure enough backward
message on KILROY WAS HERE. It is at the very beginning of ""Heavy
Metal Poisoning."" The reversed speech last about three seconds. There
is no musical background. The words reverse to ""Annuit coeptis. Novus
ordo seclorum."" This is the Latin motto encircling the pyramid on the
back of a dollar bill. The usual translation: ""God has favored our
undertakings. A new order of the ages.""
      The cover sticker's ""Majority for Musical Morality"" is a
fictitious Falwellesque group in the KILROY WAS HERE video. Although
the sticker suggests a plurality of ""messages,"" only one was found.


Space between ""I'm So Tired"" and ""Blackbird""
The Beatles, untitled, a.k.a. THE WHITE ALBUM

Rumor: A reversed message. At the time of the Paul-is-dead stories,
the segue from ""I'm So Tired"" to ""Blackbird"" was offered as evidence.
It was held to contain John Lennon's voice, reveresed, saying ""Paul is
dead, miss him, miss him, miss him."" That interpretation seems
unlikely now, but there is a mysterious low muttering between the
songs.
Findings: The mumbling is actually just to the ""I'm So Tired"" side of
the shiny ""space"" between cuts on the record. Each of the stereo
tracks was recorded separately, twice, and a copy of each track was
reversed. This produced four versions of the two-second passage: right
forward, left forward, right reversed, and left reversed. All were
equally unintelligible. It was not even apparent whether the voice is
forward or reversed. Nor could John Lennon be identified as the
speaker. There are nine or ten syllables. The first six (when played
forward) are a two-syllable unit repeated three times. There is little
or no difference betwen the stereo tracks. Any claimed interpretation
of the sounds seems doubtful.


""Strawberry Fields Forever""
The Beatles, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR

Rumor: It was, of course, claimed that John Lennon says ""I buried
Paul"" at the end. (It's forward, at the very end after the music
fades to complete silence, returns, and starts to fade out again.)
But Lennon told ROLLING STONE that the words are ""cranberry
sauce.""
Findings: They are ""cranberry sauce."" The ""sauce""/""Paul"" part is
indistinct, but the first syllable sounds a lot more like ""cran""
than ""I.""


""Baby You're a Rich Man""
The Beatles, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR

Rumor: On one of the tracks the line ""Baby you're a rich man too""
is sung as ""Baby you're a rich fag Jew,"" a dig at Brian Epstein.
Or some think it's ""rich fat Jew"" and claim it as evidence of
Beatle anti-Semitism.
Findings: Negative. The two stereo tracks are nearly identical.
It's always possible to hear words as similar-sounding words, but
basically, the lyrics jibe with the published version.


""Revolution 9""
The Beatles, untitled, a.k.a. THE WHITE ALBUM

Rumor: Various reversed and/or one-track speech. The reversal of
""Number nine"" to ""Turn me on, dead man"" has pretty much been
discounted as coincidence (though it appears on Congressman
Dornan's list).
Findings: Distinction between lyrics and any hidden message blurs
on ""Revolution 9."" The eight-minute cut is a montage of sounds
collected by John Lennon and Yoko Ono. It includes discordant
music, radio broadcasts, sirens, applause, gunfights, sports
cheers, the crackling of a fire, screams, a baby gurgling, a choir
singing, and much that cannot be identified. For this
investigation, ""Revolution 9"" was transcribed four times, twice on
each stereo channel. One copy of each of the tracks was reversed.
The four resulting versions were compared with each other and
against the original two-channel version.
     ""Revolution 9"" contains a lot of talking. Played in stereo,
forward, the longest stretch of understandable speech is probably
an announcer saying, ""...every one of them knew that as time went
by they'd get a little bit older and a little bit slower...""
     One believable instance of reversed speech occurs: someone
saying ""Let me out! Let me out!"" (once held to represent McCartney
in his totaled Aston-Martin). Two iffy reversals occur on the
backward recording of the right stereo track:""She used to be
assistant"" and ""There were two men..."" Neither is clear enough or
long enough to be convincing. Some of the music, including the
recurring theme, sounds more natural in reverse.
     ""Turn me on, dead man"" is a typical phonetic reversal. The
forward ""number nine"" (repeated throughout the cut) is clear; the
reversal is slurred -- something like ""turn me on dedmun."" It has
been claimed that ""number nine"" must be pronounced with a British
accent or with some careful inflection in order to reverse to
""Turn me on, dead man."" This seems not to be so. As an experiment,
three American-accent renderings of ""number nine"" were reversed.
All sound about as much like ""Turn me on, dead man"" as the record
did. Like the other phonetic reversals, ""Turn me on, dead man""
must be considered a coincidence.
     Much of ""Revolution 9"" is on one stereo track only. Near the
end a voice says ""A fine natural imbalance...the Watusi...the
twist...Eldorado...Eldorado."" ""A fine natural imbalance"" is on the
right track only, though the words that follow are in stereo. One
of the longer bits of speech -- ""Who could tell what he was
saying? His voice was low and his [unintelligible] was high and
his eyes were low"" -- is clear on the left track, a bare whisper
on the right.
     There is a stereophonically concealed ""secret message"" on
""Revolution 9."" The words are on the right track. They begin about
four minutes, fifty-eight seconds into the cut and run for about
twenty-two seconds. They are not likely to be noticed in stereo
because of the much louder left track. The sound of applause
begins on the left track at about five minutes, one second into
the cut. Deafening noises -- the clapping, sirens, music --
continue on the left track until five minutes, forty seconds. It
may or may not have been Lennon's and Ono's intention to conceal
the spoken passage. Given the haphazard quality of ""Revolution 9,""
the concealment may have been accidental. To recover the passage,
the left track must be switched off. The right track can then be
heard to contain a sound like a stopwatch ticking, behind these
words:

     So the wife called, and we better go to see a
     surgeon....[A SCREAM MUFFLES A LINE THAT SOUNDS LIKE
     Well, what with the prices, the prices have snowballed,
     no wonder it's closed.] ...So any and all, we went to
     see the dentist instead, who gave him a pair of teeth,
     which wasn't any good at all. So instead of that he
     joined the bloody navy and went to sea.
                      by William Poundstone
                              1986

     There really are backward messages on rock albums. And the
controversy over ""backward masking"" and ""porn rock"" has inspired a
whole new spate of messages. There may have been more genuine
backward messages in the past few years than ever before.
     The backward message controversy is usually traced to the
1960s and John Lennon's avant-garde sound mixing on such tracks as
""Revolution 9"" on the Beatles' WHITE ALBUM. Lennon probably wasn't
trying to conceal a message so much as create an interesting
sound.
     The matter might have ended right there had it not been for
the Paul McCartney death rumor. College kids tried playing Beatles
records forward, backward, and at various speeds to find ""clues""
to McCartney's fate. In the process they found snippets of speech
from Lennon's experiments. Even after McCartney was found safe and
sound in Scotland, some listeners continued to look for hidden
messages.
     Somehow, fundamentalist Christian groups became convinced
(ca. 1982) that the alleged messages were commercials for devil
worship. Not a single indisputable satanic message has turned up,
but there were scattered attempts to ban or label certain albums.
In 1986 one fundamentalist group announced that the theme song for
the old MR. ED TV show contains the word ""Satan"" when played
backward.)
     Ironically, the publicity accorded nonexistent messages has
inspired several artists -- among them porn rock hearing witness
Frank Zappa -- to hide real background messages in their music.
It's easy to do.
     The performer speaks or sings the message normally, then
reverses the tape, which is mixed into the soundtrack. This is all
accomplished simply enough at any recording studio.
     What's not so simple is playing it back. More home record,
cassette, and compact disk players won't play backward. You can
turn a record backward with a pencil eraser, but it's not good for
the needle or the turntable. The only way to reproduce the message
with full fidelity is to use a professional-quality reel-to-reel
tape player and splice the tape in backward.
     We used the facilities of KLOS radio in Los Angeles to
reverse some recent records containing true backward messages.


""Secret Messages""
Electric Light Orchestra, SECRET MESSAGES

ELO's ELDORADO album was among those alleged to contain satanic
backward masked messages. A patient listening to ELDORADO played
backward reveals no such messages. You hear only what you ought to
hear -- the reversed lyrics of the songs, which sound nothing like
the ""messages"" claimed to be there. In the wake of such
allegations, ELO did put an (innocuous) backward message on their
FACE THE MUSIC album. Perhaps they thought this would show how
silly the allegations were. Instead, the backward-masking people
seized on this as proof that the other ""messages"" were real. In
the latest volley, ELO has named an album after the controversy.
     In Britain (where the backward-masking issue is viewed as an
American eccentricity), the cover of SECRET MESSAGES has a mock
warning label to youth about the hidden label. Word of the albums'
impending release in the United States caused enough of a furor to
chill CBS Records into deleting the cover blurb.
     The reversed message is easy to find. It's at the beginning
of the first song, which is itself called ""Secret Messages."" You
can hear reversed speech when you play the record normally. A
voice intones ""secret messages"" -- forward -- in the middle of the
reversed speech, lest anyone dare be so unhip as to not know
what's going on.
     We transferred a new copy of SECRET MESSAGES to reel-to-reel
tapes and played it backward. The backward message goes: ""WELCOME
TO THE BIG SHOW/ WELCOME TO THE BIG SHOW.""
     That's it.


""Ya Hozna""
Frank Zappa, THEM OR US

""Ya Hozna,"" a six-minute composition on the first record of the
THEM OR US double album, is ENTIRELY backward. The albums' inner
cover, which includes lyrics for the other songs, says, ""backwards
vocal -- you figure it out"" of this cut. It credits Frank and Moon
Zappa, George Duke, and Napoleon Murphy Brock as vocalists.
     Played forward, ""Ya Howza"" sounds like a record played
backward -- reasonably so. The vocals are prominent and
unintelligible. Moon Zappa's voice is curiously recognizable, even
in reverse. It is hard to tell whether the music was recorded
forward or backward.
     When ""Ya Howza"" is played in reverse, you discover that the
music is virtually a palindrome -- it sounds about the same
forward and backward. The voices are all backward. In some cases
they have been modified electronically. Many of the words are
muffled. Even after repeated careful listening on both stereo
tracks, it is difficult to make out many of the lyrics. It doesn't
help that some of the words seem to be stream-of-consciousness
nonsense. Some of the unintelligible stuff sounds like opera.
     Starting at the beginning of the reversed tape -- the end of
the forward tape -- the clearer vocals go like this: ""I am the
heaven, I am the water."" This is in a hymnlike register. ""You are
a lonely little girl./ But your mommy and your daddy hold you."" A
singsong synthesizer voice.
     The most interesting part of the lyrics is an intermittently
orgasmic rap in Moon Zappa's Valley Girl voice. There are three
short monologues:

I'm like green!
I'm like squat!
I'm like soul!
Repeat, like soul!
I'm like pull, push,
Okay, like slow, slow.

You're never too old
Like slow, like slow, like slow
Okay, I like it.


All right, faster, faster,
Go, do it, do it twice,
Yeah, that feels good,
I'm looking great,
Yeah, fer shure!
Like, no way!


""No Anchovies, Please""
J. Geils Band, LOVE STINKS

""No Anchovies, Please"" is a novelty song, really a narration with
sound effects, about a woman who is kidnapped after eating
anchovies. She is taken to a ""foreign-speaking"" country. The sound
effect of the foreign tongue seems reversed. When you do play it
in reverse, it becomes: ""It doesn't take a genius to know the
difference between chicken shit and chicken salad.""


""Darling Nikki""
Prince, PURPLE RAIN

""Darling Nikki,"" cited as porn rock before Congress, is about a
dominatrix in a hotel lobby masturbating with a magazine. In part,
the complaint was that the album cover (flowers, and Prince on a
motorcycle) wasn't explicit enough to warn kids of the suggestive
lyrics. Senator Paula Hawkins apparently was not aware of a
backward message hidden in ""Darling Nikki."" The last thirty-five
seconds of the song is gibberish. The music changes abruptly and
becomes a repeated glottal sound. Then a two-syllable sound is
repeated twice, something like ""heaven, heaven."" Unintelligible
speech follows. At the end is a sound reminiscent of rain or bacon
frying , and wind sounds.
     Played backward, the message becomes:

     Hello, how are you?
     I'm fine 'cause I know that the Lord is coming soon.
     Coming, coming soon.

     It is clearly Prince and the Revolution singing this. The
words are clear but the intonation is funny -- the linger on some
words. Perhaps this is to make the reversed message you hear
playing the record normally a little less conspicuous.
     This is a weird reversal of the supposed secret message
menace. Raunchy forward lyrics conceal a religious secret message.


""Judas Kiss""
Petra, MORE POWER TO YOU

Petra is an obscure group that sings religious songs to a rock
beat. As further proof that things have gone full circle, the
backward-masking controversy prompted Petra to include a wholesome
backward message on their MORE POWER TO YOU album. It is in the
transition between two songs, just before ""Judas Kiss."" Clearly
audible gibberish reverses to this (the husky voice a cross
between George Beverly Shea and Dee Snider): ""What are you looking
for the Devil for, when you ought to be looking for the Lord?""

AFL JoyceM Welcome to the Apple II Music & Sound chat - our discussion will
           be on NoiseTracker - the new FTA music program for the GS.  AFA
           Gene will be our host this evening...Gene, the floor is yours :)

AFA Gene   Hi all... well first I'd like to point out, if y'all aren't aware
           yet, that a spanking new version of NoiseTracker has recently
           been released (9 days ago) and is now available in our New Files
           library. It is version 0.5. I haven't played around with it much
           yet, but it's supposed to fix a lot of the little bugs in 0.3
           (the first version we had online).  NoiseTracker also includes
           the ability to directly import ""modules,"" a term used for a
           certain type of Amiga song file which has become popular among PC
           users using the SoundBlaster sound card.

           Now, via NT, these ""MOD"" files are accessible by the GS. We
           expect to see a lot of activity on this end as far as ports from
           the PC and Amiga go. Note that you should be able to go straight
           to the PC music forum and download any recently uploaded MOD
           songfiles (there was a bug in the first wide release of the PCAO
           software, however, so a bunch of files with dates between around
           March 1991 and September 1991 may not download properly. Note that
           to use these PC MOD files, you'll have to rename the downloaded
           file ""MOD.xxxxxx"" if you want it to show up automatically in NT's
           ""open"" dialog box. (On the PC, all MOD files are named
           ""xxxxxxxx.MOD"" instead.)   Also, if the files are packed with ZIP
           compression, you'll need a program from the Communications Forum
           called AGATE -- it's a terminal program that includes the ability
           to unpack ZIP files.

           Now, I guess the best thing to do would be to talk about our
           favorite songfiles... there have been a few complaints, in fact,
           that people were not being ""descriptive"" enough in their file
           descriptions for uploads in describing the songs.

AFC Eddie  ?

AFA Gene   GA ed

AFC Eddie  Once a MOD file is unpacked with Agate, is a file type change
           needed?

AFA Gene   Nope, since all that NT looks for is the ""MOD."" being the first
           four characters in the filename.

AFC Eddie  OK, Thanks!

Deanna7332 Question...

JonL7      Can you list some of the features of Noisetracker?

AFA Gene   (you don't even need that ""MOD."" if you want to type the name in
           directly.)

Deanna7332 Did any of these mod files have anything to do with FTA's ""Module
           A""

AFA Gene   Sure Jon, right after we answer Deanna's question. Deanna, you
           mean ""Modulae?""

Deanna7332 Yes, that's it.

AFA Gene   Modulae was a demo written by FTA last year. (i'll get to you in a
           sec Doors).  It used SoundSmith v0.95 for all it's music. There
           is no connection between MOD files and Modulae by FTA.

Deanna7332 Throughout the demo it said ""Loading modules""

AFA Gene   Those ""modules"" are not the same as Amiga soundfile ""modules"" --
           you see, what Modulae really was was a ""stringing together"" of a
           bunch of neat little tiny demos that FTA had written. So they
           called each little demo a ""module"" and thus the entire demo as a
           whole, ""Modulae"" (fancy plural of module?)

Deanna7332 Ok I understand.  Thank you. :)

AFL JoyceM Latin, Gene :)

AFA Gene   The term ""MODule"" from the Amiga comes from the idea that all the
           stuff needed to play the songfile (all the instruments + the
           sequence file) are included into one file, the ""module.""

TheDoors1  Gene, I have tried to d/l some recent uploaded MODs in the PC
           music area and still the problem exists.

AFA Gene   As I understand it, the problem was fixed VERY recently (correct
           me on this Joyce) and files uploaded as recently as early
           November still might not work depending on the version of the
           PCAO software that the uploader used.

AFL JoyceM Actually, Gene...I was under the impression that it had been, but
           if Doors is still having a problem, then it must not be fixed.

AFA Gene   What date was the file you tried to d/l, Door?

TheDoors1  umm 11/17, around there

AFA Gene   hmmm.... well i can tell you one thing... if it didn't work, don't
           waste your time again later... the problem is in the Apple
           software's method of d/lling files, and there are no plans to
           upgrade the Apple AO software.

AFL JoyceM I will endeavor to get an answer to that PC downloading
           problem/question :)

ThomasK63  i have a quick question... what can you use to unpack amiga mod
           files? On the PC side, that is.

TheDoors1  Agate Thomas

ELECTMUSIC Doors... what happens on after downloading..

Deanna7332 If it's LZHed you can't unless you have an IBM or
           PC/Transporter.

AFA Gene   If GS-ShrinkIt doesn't have that ability, i don't think there
           exists any such utility on the GS.

TheDoors1  What do you mean Elect?

ELECTMUSIC After you download the file... where do you encounter a problem?

TheDoors1  ok, you know when you download the file and at some point in the
           download the file starts to appear on your screen.  That's when I
           cancel it.

ThomasK63  I am sure soething good can be made w/out resorting to Amiga
           files

AFC Eddie  Yes, Doors, I believe the problem is with the PC software it was
           UL'd with.

TheDoors1  yeah Eddie.

GNO Tim    Amiga MOD files are typically compressed using LHarc.  I've
           uncompressed several on my Unix machine at school.

ThomasK63  good time for someone to make a lharc unpacker...

AFC DYAJim someone might be ;)

GNO Tim    Several people are already

AFC Eddie  Can't wait, Jim!

AFA Gene   Jon, did you have a question?

JonL7      The features of Noisetracker :)

AFA Gene   Oh yes... okay, here goes, in a nutshell, from most important to
           least:


AFA Gene   *  ability to import MOD files

           *  ability to import Soundsmith files

           *  ProDOS 8 based

           *  virtually no editing abilities (not a feature but important to
           know)

AFC DYAJim :)

AFA Gene   *  forgot: and the most important feature of all, the ability to
           hold instrument files in regular system RAM instead of DOC RAM,
           allowing for instruments far beyond the regular 64K limit found
           in ALL other GS music programs.

ThomasK63  I'll buy that!

TheDoors1  I have another question...when you're ready.

AFA Gene   GA Doors

TheDoors1  ok..is it true that NoiseTracker will take in soundsmith files and
           play them more clearly

AFA Gene   Well, as far as ""what you hear,"" yes there is a definite
           difference with some instruments. It does NOT play the sounds
           more ""clearly,"" but it just plays them in a different way. What
           many people seem to like about this ""different way"" is that
           sustained instruments (i.e. instruments designed to be played
           in a loop to simulate a long held note) seem to work better (or
           perhaps simply the way they were originally intended to work).

TheDoors1  I see

Deanna7332 Which takes up more space - MOD or NT  w/soundfile ?

AFA Gene   Deanna, it depends a few things, such as how big the sequence is,
           how many instruments you have, etc. Once you have a lot of
           assorted files, it'll probably average out to be about the same
           give or take a hundred blocks on your HD. So it basically depends
           on whether you prefer to have your instruments separate or not.

Deanna7332 Does playing quality differ with either one ?

AFA Gene   Nope. It's exactly the same either way. Loading time is the same
           too.

AFC Eddie  Can NT save songs as MOD files?

AFA Gene   Nope. It has options for Open and Close module, but these are
           still inactive.

AFA Gene   If there are no more questions, I'd like to talk about which NT
           files out there are the ""hottest,"" since this info could be
           useful to many users who are interested in downloading NT/MOD
           files.

           My personal favorite is ""Lambada,"" which is supplied by FTA with
           the program but is available separately on America
           Online.Everything about this file is really impressive except
           perhaps the sound quality of the horn-ish melody instrument.

           What about y'all, what are your favorite NT files?

AFL JoyceM Gene, there is a classical song for NT, but can't remember the
           name, but it is good.

AFC Eddie  I like Dragnet!

ELECTMUSIC So do I Ed

TheDoors1  I like Seven something

Deanna7332 My most favorite of all mod files is Pleasure Principle

AFC Eddie  <--appreciate's Greg's taste!

AFL JoyceM :)

AFA Gene   Deanna, i assume you got that from a local board?

Deanna7332 I got it from the PC forum here.

TheDoors1  I saw it there also

Deanna7332 I think under ""Pleasure""

AFA Gene   Would you be able to upload it here? If it's really that good, we
           ought to have it available directly in our oun NT lib here (BTW
           folks, we will be releasing a new NoiseTracker software library
           soon!)

AFC Eddie  What a Forum!!!

Deanna7332 That sounds great!

AFL JoyceM Gene, do you think it will be possible for synthLAB files to be
           converted to MOD files?

AFL JoyceM MOD files?

AFA Gene   I doubt it, Joyce. The formats are so diametrically opposed in
           their entire basis of their file formats that it wouldn't be
           worth the time for a programmer to develop such a convertor.

Deanna7332 Isn't it possible to move the mod file from the PC forum to our
           music library?

AFA Gene   But..... it might be worth the time for a MIDI File Format to MOD
           convertor, since these two formats are more widely accepted.

Nuzz       they have nothing better to do Gene

ELECTMUSIC Gene.. some interesting similarities with DTune and NTracker

AFA Gene   They lose the file, tho, Deanna. :)

AFL JoyceM In what way, Greg?

ELECTMUSIC Both Prodos 8

Deanna7332 Shhh they won't know a thing :)

ELECTMUSIC I also believe Bill uses a shuttling of sound data between Doc
           Ram and Ram.

AFC Eddie  Interesting, Greg.

ELECTMUSIC Thats how he gets some of the excellent instrument quality

AFC Eddie  But Diversitune has that one distinction:  MIDI input.

AFL JoyceM Deanna, we would greatly appreciate it if you would upload that
           'Pleasure' song to our library :)

ELECTMUSIC Agreed Ed.. one of the factors FTA doesn't like to incorporate
           into their programs.

Deanna7332 I'll u/l it tonight if possible.

AFL JoyceM Thanks :)

AFC Eddie  Thanks, Deanna!

AFL JoyceM I will send Bill B a copy of NoiseTracker + some MOD files...to
           see what comments we get from him (will send when I get back).

AFC DYAJim What ever happened to that diversitune upgrade that was talked
           about ?

ELECTMUSIC That would be interesting Joyce

AFC Eddie  Bill apparently still working on it, Jim.

ELECTMUSIC I am sure he would appreciate the Prodos 8

AFC DYAJim good..

AFL JoyceM Jim...RSN....he was hoping by Christmas (this year), but he is
           soooo busy with his job, who knows?

AFC DYAJim Oh yeah, I noticed the speed calcuation in NT .5 is inaccurate
           :)

AFC DYAJim I recall he has set a lot of Christmas projected dates :)

ELECTMUSIC He was one of the first ""Free Tools"" experts in breaking all the
           rules for economic sake.

AFC DYAJim like for the vaporware DT inst editor like 2 years ago.

Deanna7332 Are there any Christmas Mod or NT songs?

AFC Eddie  Oh yeah, Diversi-Editor!

AFL JoyceM I know, Jim - but that I know he has been working on.

AFC DYAJim he projected Christmas for it, and it never came :)

AFA Gene   Not yet in AMS, but hopefully the Holiday Contest will change all
           that. :)

AFC DYAJim I look foreward to any upgrades..

AFL JoyceM Not that I am aware of Deanna - you have some?  hint, hint

Deanna7332 Nope sorry.  I was hoping there were some that could be u/led
           here

AFC DYAJim I'll be breaking out the xmas tune book rsn.. I should be able to
           midi a few :) (which rules out nt)

AFL JoyceM Question...

AFC Eddie  It would be more appropriate to have a converter from Appleworks
           spreadsheet to MOD than from MIDI!

AFL JoyceM If I got ahold of an Amiga song (MOD) disk...how would I convert
           them for here?

AFA Gene   You mean an Amiga-formatted disk?

AFL JoyceM Yes

AFC DYAJim Ack.. methinks you need an amiga and a null modem cable or a
           modem.

AFA Gene   Methinks Jim is right

AFC DYAJim LOL!!  Design your music in the spreadsheet then import to NT :)
           IT might actually have better editing?!! :)

AFC Eddie  Right!

AFL JoyceM Me thinks he is right.  If I had them upload to me, would that
           work?

AFA Gene   Yep; should work like a charm.

AFC DYAJim Yah.. as long as they're coming from an amiga

AFL JoyceM Great....I will work on that when I get back  (making note now).

AFL JoyceM Gene, will you get some of those files (NT) sent to that area
           tonight?  If so, I will leave the needed message :)

AFA Gene   That's all I have planned for tonight's chat, Joyce. Yep, I'll
           move some files right now.

AFL JoyceM Thanks...

AFL JoyceM Then we should have our NoiseTracker Library by end of the week in
           AMS :)

ELECTMUSIC Gene... quick question:  Are you launching NTracker from a 3.5
           disk?

AFL JoyceM Okay, guys...I will see you all the week of December 11th (may the
           4th) as I am off on vacation.

AFA Gene   Yep greg

AFC JohnC  Where are you going?

ELECTMUSIC Do you encounter out of memory problems

AFL JoyceM Night all...and Gene, thanks for an excellent chat and great
           explanations of NoiseTracker.

Nuzz       Joyce, I have good news for FutureSound owners. SoundConvert will
           support it in the first release

AFC Eddie  Great, Mike!

AFA Gene   Greg, i always keep my RAMdisk at 0 when using noisetracker. Not
           only are

AFC JohnC  Mike...SoundConvert...released?

AFL JoyceM Great, Mike.  When can we get SoundConvert, Mike? and FutureSound
           :)

AFA Gene   there a couple of bugs with memory management, but if you're
           loading in a MOD file that's really big, NT will eat your RAMdisk.

AFC Eddie  Sounds good.

Nuzz       The manual is being ""layout"". Release date should be about 1st
           week of Dec

ELECTMUSIC Tnxs Gene

AFC JohnC  YES.......WTG Nuzz!!!!!!!!

Deanna7332 Yes, why is there on some MOD files a stop somewhere in the middle
           ?

Deanna7332 That's really frustrating!

AFL JoyceM Mike, leave me E-Mail on when and how I can send your the $$ to
           get it.

AFL JoyceM Again...night all

Nuzz       gee John, I had to do something to explain the delay :)

ELECTMUSIC Thanks Gene for a GREAT chat!

AFC Eddie  Yes, Gene!  Great!

AFA Gene   Thanks Greg, 'night!

AFA Gene   thanx, see y'all later :)

Copyright 1987 Bob Szekely.

    John Michael Osbourne, (known as ""Ozzy"" to his fans), has in his long 
career as vocalist for Black Sabbath had his work with the group misconstrued 
as advocating Satanism.  In a 1983 radio special featuring Ozzy, the 
interviewer expressed precisely this point; ""...Ozzy has always been shrouded 
in the darkest of Satanic imagery.  Yet if you really listen to his music, 
you'll find that what he is saying differs greatly from his image....""(1)  Even 
the group's image has often been described as ""occult and diabolic"".(2)

    The important point to remember here is to differentiate between appearance 
and reality.  Although the name ""Black Sabbath"" conjures up images of witches 
and sorcerers paying homage to Satan for the powers bestowed upon them, this 
does not make it safe to assume that the group that went by this name 
necessarily drew the inspiration from the occult.(3)  The closest they ever 
came to it was a gothic horror film featuring Boris Karloff as narrator; they 
adopted their name directly from the name of this film.(4)  Black Sabbath was 
involved in the black arts as much as Karloff practiced casting spells off-
screen.  Tony Iommi, the group's guitarist, summed it up best when he described 
the group as having basically ""...the same appeal as a horror movie.  It's all 
an act.""(5)










    Just as their film counterpart did, Ozzy and Sabbath found the occult 
mythos to be an effective vehicle for powerful social commentary; particularly 
when put in the context of heavy-metal rock and roll.  Ozzy himself noted that 
there are ""...people who pick up my [album] cover[s] and go...'This guy's got 
to be singing about Devil, doom, death and destruction.'  Which is not the 
case....""(6)

    The late Lester Bangs likened the group to Bob Dylan and William Burroughs, 
describing them all as ""...moralists...trying to deal with a serious present 
situation in an honest way....""(7)  Ozzy and Black Sabbath merely bring to 
light the many evils of our world in their work, to try and make us realize 
that we are all victim to their influence.  They hope to make us recognize 
these evils so that we may take up arms against them; a point Ozzy emphatically 
stresses:  ""...one thing everybody has got to understand about Black Sabbath's 
lyrics.  They're not downer lyrics, they're just telling everybody where it's 
at...""(8)  He also cites the group's most controversial tune, ""Black Sabbath"", 
as a response to the ignorant hippie culture still force when the tune was 
written in 1970:  ""The hippies said: 'The world is beautiful man.' (sic)  You 
only had to look around you to see how crappy it was.  It was ridiculous 
listening to that stuff, let alone playing it, so we just wrote about the world 
the way it really was and how it affected us - and we felt better in ourselves 
because we were really being honest....""(9)

    I   1   HAVE YOU EVER THOUGH ABOUT YOUR SOUL-
        2   CAN IT BE SAVED?
        3   OR PERHAPS YOU THINK THAT WHEN YOU ARE DEAD
        4   YOU JUST STAY IN YOUR GRAVE.
        5   IS GOD JUST A THOUGHT WITHIN YOUR HEAD OR IS
        6   HE A PART OF YOU?
        7   IS CHRIST JUST A NAME THAT YOU READ IN A BOOK
        8   WHEN YOU WERE AT SCHOOL?

    II  9   WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT DEATH DO YOU LOSE
        10  YOUR BREATH OR DO YOU KEEP YOUR COOL?
        11  WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE THE POPE ON THE END
        12  OF A ROPE - DO YOU THINK HE'S A FOOL?
        13  WELL I'VE SEEN THE TRUTH - YES I'VE SEEN 
        14  THE LIGHT AND I'VE CHANGED MY WAYS.
        15  AND I'LL BE PREPARED WHEN YOU'RE LONELY 
        16  AND SCARED AT THE END OF OUR DAYS.

    III 17  COULD IT BE YOU'RE AFRAID OF WHAT YOU'R
        18  FRIENDS MIGHT SAY 
        19  IF THEY NEW YOU BELIEVED IN GOD ABOVE
        20  THEY SHOULD REALISE BEFORE THE CRITICISE
        21  THAT GOD IS THE ONLY WAY TO LOVE.

    IV  23  IS YOUR MIND SO SMALL THAT YOU HAVE TO FALL
        24 IN WITH THE PACK WHEREVER THEY RUN
        25  WILL YOU STILL SNEER WHEN DEATH IS NEAR
        26  AND SAY THEY MAY AS WELL WORSHIP THE SUN.

    V   27  I THINK IT WAS TRUE IT WAS PEOPLE LIKE YOU
        28  THAT CRUCIFIED CHRIST
        29  I THINK IT IS SAD THE OPINION YOU HADE WAS THE
        30  ONLY ONE VOICED.
        31  WILL YOU BE SO SURE WHEN YOUR DAY IS NEAR
        32  SAY YOU DON'T BELIEVE?
        33  YOU HAD THE CHANCE BUT YOU TURNED IT DOWN
        34  NOW YOU CAN'T RETRIEVE.










    VI  35  PERHAPS YOU'LL THINK BEFORE YOU SAY THAT
        36  GOD IS DEAD AND GONE
        37  OPEN YOUR EYES, JUST REALIZE THAT HE IS THE
        38  ONE.
        39  THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN SAVE YOU KNOW FROM
        40  ALL THIS SIN AND HATE.
        41  OR WILL YOU STILL JEER AT ALL YOU HEAR?
        42  YES!-I THINK IT'S TOO LATE.

    In this piece, the group asserts a belief in an afterlife and spiritual 
redemption.  As grisly as the image of a hanged pontiff is, its shock value is 
a necessary part of the message:  They reject religious dogma, stating that a 
belief in God, in one's own heart, is the only guiding light to help one inn 
his life (lines 11/12, 39/40).  Furthermore, the reject religious hypocrisy 
(lines 5/6, 7/8) and peer pressure (verses III, IV) as excuses for not 
accepting God.  To clarify further:  following the crowd does not justify 
shrugging responsibility for one's own actions.

    After re-reading, it becomes obvious that this song is an ascerbic critique 
of atheism; (line 35/36) I refer here again to verses three and four.  In these 
two verses, the picture painted in one of Godless conformity and how it's 
viewed as being as foolish as Paganism.  These lyrics set an example for the 
listener by relating personal experience (lines 13-16).  However, for those who 
cannot accept this the group has no recourse but to condemn them, although 
rather ironically; they hope that their rhetorical loss of faith in the 
listener will open his eyes (line 42).

            WHAT IS THIS, THAT STANDS BEFORE ME?
            FIGURE IN BLACK, WHICH POINTS AT ME
            TURN ROUND QUICK AND START TO RUN
            FIND OUT I'M THE CHOSEN ONE.  OH, NO!
            
            BIG BLACK SHAPE WITH EYES OF FIRE
            TELLING PEOPLE THEIR DESIRE
            SATAN'S SITTING THERE, HE'S SMILING
            WATCHES THOSE FLAMES GET HIGHER AND HIGHER
            OH, NO, NO, -- PLEASE GOD HELP ME!
            
                IS THIS THE END MY FRIEND?
                SATAN'S COMING 'ROUND THE BEND
                PEOPLE RUNNING 'CAUSE THEY'RE SCARED
                THE PEOPLE BETTER GO AND BEWARE
                NO, NO!  PLEASE--NO!!
                
                
    The all time controversy winner!  Is this not irrefutably  THE song about 
Black Magic in rock?  It's all so obvious, suffuse with evil imagery; Satan, 
walls of flame, figure in black, and damnation at the end.  Yes, I see the 
images too; it definitely concerns Black Magic.  Then again, Shakespeare's 
Macbeth employed scenes of witches involved in conjurations; does that mean 
that Shakespeare was a warlock?  Poe used to write sardonic tragedies about 
twisted murderers and the bizarre nature of acts, did that make him an evil, 
leering, demented killer?  Did either of them advocated what they wrote about?  
One has to remember that writing about something is not necessarily the same as 
emulating it.  Tony Iommi spoke out quite strongly about this:  ""People are 
bringing us down saying that we are a Black Magic group.  I think they must be










getting mixed up with Black Widow.  We don't do any sacrifices on stage, and 
we're not on a black magic kick.  We wanted to do heavy numbers and the guitar 
riffs we worked out were more suited to evil things than love.  We play songs 
about black magic, but they are more likely to be against than for it.""(12)  

    By now, you're probably asking yourself who Black Widow is, right?  Then 
it's time for a little history:

        Sabbath, before they were known as Sabbath, had the same line-up but 
two earlier names.  The first one was Polka Tulk, which seemed sure to doom 
them to obscurity.(13)  The soon realized this and changed the group's name to 
Earth.  Now, Earth was a blues band at the end of the English blues boom.  As 
if that wasn't bad enough, they soon discovered that not only was there another 
group named Earth, but they had also released a single.  To avoid confusion, 
they changed their name again.(14)  But what made them decide on that name?  
Just ask Ozzy:  ""I just liked the name Black Sabbath because of the succession 
of vowel sounds.(15)  If that sounds ludicrous just consider this:  Sabbath was 
""...the first of the really committed, loud and heavy bands...""(16)  They 
needed a name to match the gut-wrenching power they were developing.  Tony knew 
that he wanted Sabbath to be noticed above all the rest of the British blues 
bands:  ""We wanted something of our own that we'd like and people would like.  
And we wanted something loud!""










    Tony didn't hate the blues.  He'd cut his teeth as a guitarist on the likes 
of The Shadows, Buddy Holly and Django Rheinhardt, developing his own style 
from there.  But he realized the group had no future in the blues:

        'We couldn't keep playing 12-bars forever.  We just got fed up with 
Earth music.  It was jazz, blues stuff.  It was good for practice but nothing 
else.'

    In the late 'Sixties, blues groups were a dime a dozen in Birmingham and 
interest was waning in the blues boom due to the glut of groups.  One man, by 
the name of Jim Simpson, had heard Earth around the Birmingham club circuit and 
understood what they were trying to do.  He decided to take them under his 
wing.  With the aid of his massive record collection, Jim expanded the group's 
horizons in the areas of jazz and blues.  He introduced them to artists like 
Wes Montgomery, Count Basie and Jimmy Rushing.  It was from Rushing in 
particular that they derived the repetitive riff style so readily noticeable in 
their later incarnation as Black Sabbath.

    The Count Basie influence is evidenced in the song ""Wicked World"" from the 
first album; Sabbath drummer Bill Ward uses a ""'sighing hi-hat'...in the manner 
of Basie's drummer Jo Jones.""










    The influence is subtle, almost subliminal.  Yet it is one which was not 
thought capable of hard, 'heavy' rock bands in the late 'Sixties.  Although Led 
Zeppelin and Jimi Hendrix also had their work steeped in blues and jazz 
derivations (Hendrix' ""Third Stone From the Sun"" and Zeppelin's version of 
Willie Dixon's ""I Can't Quit You Baby"" from their first album), neither was 
able to match the intense energy of Black Sabbath.  Iommi has always had a 
preference for music with an original, distinct style of its' own; as an 
example, he mentions guitarists Joe Pass and Alvin Lee as two of his strongest 
songwriting influences.

    It would also be necessary that Sabbath develop a unique, distinctive style 
and image of their own.  Though they had changed their name from Earth to Black 
Sabbath to avoid confusion with the other Earth; at the same time another group 
emerged by the name of Black Widow ""...who WERE profoundly influenced by the 
occult, had a male witch as a patron, and wrote pieces like ""Come to The 
Sabbat.""  Unfortunately, Sabbath was constantly reaping the benefits of Widow's 
publicity.

    Sabbath was a group that never minced words.  If they saw something as 
destructive, they would be sure to rub the listener's face it it.  They did not 
want their point to be missed.

    With their straightforward, sometimes brutal way of looking at things, they 
try to shock the listener's conscience back into awareness.  The imagery of 
""Hand of Doom"", from the Paranoid album, is candid and condemning; it is a 
strong statement against drug addiction and rightly so...

            IT'S TO LATE TOO TURN
            YOU DON'T WANNA LEARN
            PRICE OF LIFE YOU CRY
            NOW YOU'RE GONNA DIE
            
            
    Many people felt the group's overall direction was pessimistic and had a 
negative effect on its listener's due to that.  ""Ozzy insisted that if people 
thought he was having a bad effect on the minds of young kids, they should go 
and watch the TV news where real murder and mayhem were a way of life, and 
shown night after night."" (18)

    Sabbath was never negative in their message; they were simply truthful 
about waht they saw as wrong in the world.  If you ""Strip away the horror 
stories, the imagery and the hysteria, (and) turn down the amps a notch...you 
have a well-rehearsed, solid blues and rock band, powered by a dedication to 
well defined objectives.""  On the top of the list of those objectives was 
truth; Sabbath never feared facing that truth squarely, regardless of what many 
people thought of them.

Long, long, time ago,
I can still remember,
When the local calls were ""free"".
And I knew if I paid my bill,
And never wished them any ill,
That the phone company would let me be...

But Uncle Sam said he knew better,
Split 'em up, for all and ever!
We'll foster competition:
It's good capital-ism!

I can't remember if I cried,
When my phone bill first tripled in size.
But something touched me deep inside,
The day... Bell System... died.

And we were singing...

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

Is your office Step by Step,
Or have you gotten some Crossbar yet?
Everybody used to ask...
Oh, is TSPS coming soon?
IDDD will be a boon!
And, I hope to get a Touch-Tone phone, real soon...

The color phones are really neat,
And direct dialing can't be beat!
My area code is ""low"":
The prestige way to go!

Oh, they just raised phone booths to a dime!
Well, I suppose it's about time.
I remember how the payphones chimed,
The day... Bell System... died.

And we were singing...

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

Back then we were all at one rate,
Phone installs didn't cause debate,
About who'd put which wire where...
Installers came right out to you,
No ""phone stores"" with their ballyhoo,
And 411 was free, seemed very fair!

But FCC wanted it seems,
To let others skim long-distance creams,
No matter 'bout the locals,
They're mostly all just yokels!

And so one day it came to pass,
That the great Bell System did collapse,
In rubble now, we all do mass,
The day... Bell System... died.

So bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

I drove on out to Murray Hill,
To see Bell Labs, some time to kill,
But the sign there said the Labs were gone.
I went back to my old CO,
Where I'd had my phone lines, years ago,
But it was empty, dark, and ever so forlorn...

No relays pulsed,
No data crooned,
No MF tones did play their tunes,
There wasn't a word spoken,
All carrier paths were broken...

And so that's how it all occurred,
Microwave horns just nests for birds,
Everything became so absurd,
The day... Bell System... died.

So bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

We were singing:

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?

But there's still hope left for me!   And that's all right with me!

We will got to worship Lillith          If you get too tired
Grab your cup, step up and fill it      And you need to get up higher
Tho 'ware she don't make you spill it!  Just have Pele light your fire!
And that's good eonough for me!         From her island in the sea!

Quetzacoatl's flyin'                  Drink to FUFLUNS he's just fine
With the Toltec and the Mayan         The Etruscan god of wine
And the mushrooms he's been buyin'    This verse doesn't really rhyme
Are good enough for me!               But it's good enough for me!

We will worship Christian Jesus       You can keep your saints with halos,
And do just like John Paul pleases    Your hosannas or dayenus:
That we will... when Hades freezes!   Let's throw virgins in volcanos!
And that's good enough for me!        And that's good enough for me!

Let's go worship Great Cthulhu,       In Japan they thought it neato
And run naked like a Zulu,            When they worshipped Hirohito
You and me and Mr. Sulu,              But that didn't sit with SEATO
And that's good enough for me!        So it never more will be!

I can't rhyme Ahura Mazda,              We will all bow down to Venus
And I'll praise the man who tries ta,   As we dance upon Mt Zenos
Then I'll wait for Barak Raz ta,        We will worship with our....voice
And that's good enough for me!          And that's good enough for me!

Oh, the dollar is our Saviour        And when old Quetzacoatl
If we spend Her or we save Her       Found a virgin he could throttle
She controls all our behaviour       And put her heart into a bottle
There's not enough for me!           It was good enough for me!

There are those who worship science     I'll go get my golden sickle
And some would send 'em to the Lions    And I'll wear it where it tickles
But without 'em we'd have no appliance  It ain't used for cuttin' pickles!
So they're good enough for me!          And it's good enough for me!

In the church of Aphrodite                 John, Paul, George and Ringo
The Priestess wears a see through nightie  We will worship playing Bingo
She's a mighty righteous sightie,          We will listen to them sing-o
And she's good enough for me!              And that's good enough for me!

   And put the archer's noses out of joint
   He thought we had too many Orders
   So the Pheon lost its' point!                          (16)

   Sedalia and Viktor took the sceptre
   And there happened a peculiar thing:
   They both drank so much Imperium Compound
   You couldn't tell which one was King!                  (16)

   Morghun Sheridan had a Crown to win
   Which he did for one and all to see;
   He washed his dishes in Imperium Compound
   And put the Kingdom on KP!                             (16)

   Ronald Wilmot says he is still not
   Sure that his good luck he can believe:
   He flew due East on Imperium Compound
   And landed in the strawberry leaves!                   (16)

   The Fates were perusing; a King they were choosing
   Of the safe and sane and saintly sort
   Then they tippled Imperium Compound,
   And now Sebastian's holding Court!                     (16)

   Bruce of Cloves was King of the Eastland
   But his reign it must have been a bore:
   Just what he did with Imperium Compound
   No one remembers anymore!                              (16)

   When Laeghaere O'Laverty has the depravity
   To entertain a Lady in her bower,
   He takes a sip of Imperium Compound,
   Ere demonstrating Tyrone's power!                      (16)

   Fernando drank Imperium Compound
   But he doesn't do it any more;
   Not since he saw a Quetzacoatl
   Above his chamber door!     // a-singing....! //       (16)

   Fredrick of Holland drank Imperium Compound
   But he didn't think it awfully neat,
   Made a face and muttered lowly:
   ""This stuff is too damn sweet!""                        (16)

9
   When Setanta ascended the Eastern Throne
   He was nothing special to behold;
   Until he drank some Imperium Compound:
   Now he's a Playgirl centerfold!                        (16)

   When Setanta was the Crown Prince
   He wore garments of a sombre hue
   Then he tasted Imperium Compound
   And now he's berry, berry blue!                        (16)

   Imperium Compound is a manly brew
   As many a puissant Countess will assert!
   It makes you wonder about King Vissevald
   The King who wears a skirt!                            (16)

   Vissevald is King of the Eastland
   Drinks Imperium Compound by the quart
   He likes it so much he's never noticed
   We now wear daggers into Court!                        (16)

   Vissevald and his Lady Mara
   Danced ""La Volta"" through the night;
   He drank too deep of Imperium Compound,
   And she's now a satellite!                             (16)

   Gavin Kilkenny asked ""Is there any-
   One who would dispute my rightful Throne?
   I'll take a double Imperium Compound,
   For it seems I have a clone!""                          (16)

   AElfwine the Saxon, whose family's flaxen
   Whose courtesy is all the Northland's pride;
   Mixes his mead now with Imperium Compound
   Often a bridesmaid, now a bride!                       (16)

   Siegfried, thrice King, showed us a new thing
   When fighting for the Eastern Crown:
   He took a swig of Imperium Compound
   And proved you CAN win from one-down!                  (16)

   Richard of Mont Roy-al, the Short he
   Is very fast and very hard to kill;
   As tall as Frodo, or his dog, Odo,
   But he kisses Froggies with a will!                     (5)

   Duke Sir Deaton, was never beaten
   On the field, or in the drinking hall;
   At the Catbox War with Caid,
   Left thirty bodies piled against the wall!              (5)

   Denis O'Titans was good at smitin'
   A Locksley Monster in every single way!
   Drank a little Imperium Compound
   And ATE Deaton's sword that day  // No! REALLY! //       (5)

   Wotan the Mongoloid, a little bit paranoid,
   But a nice guy none the less;
   Drank a mess of Imperium Compound
   Now he's Justin du Roc, I confess!                       (5)

10
   Then there's Duke Reynard, with a face like a St. Bernard
   Of the Dukes, he is the homliest
   He tends to toke up on Imperium Compound
   And go out and whomp on anybody's best!                   

   Oh, Ebenezer, thought he was Julius Caesar
   So they put him in the Funny Home.
   Then they gave him Imperium Compound,
   Now he's Emperor of Rome.
                 
   AltChorus: Oh let's drink a drink, a drink, a drink,  
              To Lily the Pink, the Pink, the Pink,
              The savior of the human ra-aa-ace.
              She invented Imperium Compound,
              Most effacatious in evr'y case.

   There was Horic, We thought he was sick,
   As a War-Puppy he was insane,
   Gave up Tranya for Imperium Compound,
   Now we have an Acid Reign!            //Oh wow, man!//   (18)

   This song'll bedevil the folks at a revel,
   And most of the time it will annoy the King,
   So take a drink of Imperium Compound
   And let's go Royalty-bedeviling!                         (5)

   Duchess Anna is quite a fan-a
   Going on a wartime shopping spree!  \\ War Point!\\
   Took a drink of Imperium Compound
   And shopped so fast we couldn't see! \\ Z-o-o-o-om!\\    (5)

   Lyn of Whitewolfe, made of the right stuff,
   Twice the Queen of Atenveldt;

   Duke Sir Brion, and Duke Sir Trelon,
   Won the Crown with regularity;
   Drank a lot of Imperium Compound,
   And founded a dynasty!                                   (5)

   Stephan von Geist, was most awful nice,
   And a chivalrous fighter without any doubt
   Took a swig of Imperium Compound
   And won the Crown his first time out!                    (5)

   All the Crusadenes were big, but not mean,
   And the finest fighters in the town.
   But they all drank Jerusalem Compound,
   Winning Crown after Crown after Crown!                   (5)

   Good Duke Arthur couldn't get no farth-er
   A Norman King in Aten Land
   Drank too much of Imperium Compound
   And went off to conquer Engel-land!                      (5)

   Then King Richard, a bit of a bitch, heard
   A King's Crown could be done.
   Drank a little Imperium Compound
   And became the Aten King, first one!                     (5)
11
   There was Astra, no one ever asked her
   And she was for having fun!
   Then she sampled Imperium Compound,
   And today she is a nun   \\ not better!\\               (19)

   There's good old Igor, his prowess is meager
   For he never learned to water-ski!

   Then there's Dagan, his brother's the Ka-Khan,
   Which is quite funny in a King!
   If he gets hooked on Imperium Compound
   There'll be new songs to sing!    \\ Oh, really?\\       (19)  

   Fredrick of Holland, who dwells in the Northland,
   A Master from the West, he came!
   Spends all his money for Imperium Compound
   That's why his garb's always the same!                   (20)

   Now Gyrth Oldcastle, round as a beer barrel,
   Once chose to quarrel with a certain Bard;
   The poet served him with Imperium Compound,
   And left him rendered down to lard!                      (20)

   Many tales abound of Imperium Compound
   And its' strange effects on Royalty,
   But after an hour, this song has no power,
   And by now, it's boring ME!                             (16)

   Duchess Malinda, who doesn't do windas
   But she does a lot of Duchess Things,
   But give her a LOT of Imperium Compound,
   And she sings and sings and sings and sings and sings!   (5)

   AltChorus: Oh it's too long, too long, too long
              To sing the whole song, the song, the song
              Longer than a Royal Court, it is!
              But sing it serial, this ditty Imperial
              And you'll be a bardic whiz!                 (5)

                                             IMPERIUM COMPOUND    
                                             (Atenveldt Verses)

   Now here's a story, a little bit gory,
   A little bit happy, a little bit sad.
   About a drink called Imperium Compound
   And how the SCA's been had!                       

   Chorus: Oh we think, we think, we think,
           The King is a fink, a fink, a fink,
           A figure of respectability
           Rules the Kingdom thru Imperium Compound
           The results are plain to see!

   Mongol Hordemen, those free-living swordsmen
   Subverting the Kingdoms from underneath!
   Have no use for Imperium Compound
   Except perhaps to brush their teeth!

   AltChorus: Oh we fink, we fink, we fink,
              The Khan and the Kink, the Kink, the Kink,
              And the Board, their Great Senilities!
              The Western Irgun, drinks Imperium Compound
              And we're BACK, with results you'll see!    

   Lady Laurel, with Authority Royal,
   Passes and rejects our heraldry
   She needs a swig of Imperium Compound
   Then perhaps she'd deign to talk to me!            

   Lady Trude thought it her duty
   To turn a social wrong into a Right
   Proved her point with Imperium Compound
   And showed that Cheshire Cats can fight!  //and scratch//

   The Board of Directors styled themselves The Electors
   And another con they tried to swing
   Now the BoD drinks Imperium Compound
   So we no longer need a King!                        

   AltChorus: Oh the Bod, the BoD, the BoD,
              It thinks it is God, is God, is God,
              The figure of Supreme Authority!
              And if we O.D.'d on Imperium Compund
              there'd be no need for Royalty!          

   Oh, MEDIEVAL Net, we thought it was all wet
   With witty remarks, and other kinds of sass
   We'll feed our computers on Imperium Compound
   And BYTE the BoD right on its' righteous ass!         

   Good old Duncan was often drunken
   Chasing all the ladies fair
   He bathed himself in Imperium Compound
   Now he has a little savoir faire!                     

                    (more)


  ATEN IMPERIUM (cont.)

   Ioseph of Locksley, never changes his socks, he
   Runs around looking like a Cavalier,
   He stocked up on Imperium Compound
   And he has enough to last for years and years!        

   AltChorus: Oh they forgot, forgot, forgot
              The Locks-e-ly Plot, the Plot, the Plot!
              And it works the best when it is underground!
              It isn't a hassle for a green-and-white tassle
              They're the ones that BREW Imperium Compound!  

   Trelon of the Wood, he was very good, he
   Was a leader that had never been beat before;
   But Caid had Imperium Compound,
   And Imperial Roman Caid won the War!  //with help!//   

   In Tyr Ysgithr, it's regularly whispered there
   That the Kingdom is ruled over by a King    // What's THAT? //
   They're ""democratic"" and quite erratic....
   They've forgot the purpose of the whole damn thing!     

   King Sir Mark von, with his pretty white suit on,
   Rules the Kingdom both with Grace and Purity!
   He never touches Imperium Compound
   At least not where anyone else can see!               

   Duke Sir Deaton, was never beaten
   On the field, or in the drinking hall;
   At the Catbox War with Caid,
   Left thirty bodies piled against the wall!             

   Denis O'Titans was good at smitin'
   A Locksley Monster in every single way!
   Drank a little Imperium Compound
   And ATE Deaton's sword that day  // No! REALLY! //

                          WTP-0002C

        Last night I had the strangest dream in this bleak century
        I dreamed that people the world around believed in Chivalry

        I dreamed I saw a Kingly Crown enshrined in laurel leaves
        with Grace and Joy and Purity attendant at his feet

        I dreamed I saw the perfect Knight receive his accolade
        and minstrels sang and children laughed in some soft forest glade

        I dreamed I saw the finest thing that ever man could make
        grow great and strong and undefiled: Pray God I never wake!

        Last night I had the strangest dream in this bleak century
        I dreamed that people the world around believed in Chivalry

               (to the tune of ""Good King Wenceslaus"")

                Locksley Monsters never yield
                on the field of battle
                strike the helm and bash the shield
                make their eyeteeth rattle
                Bodies on the ground will lie
                bones will burst in sunder
                search for Locksleys' enemies:
                You'll find them six feet under!

                              SONG OF IVANOF

            There is a man who we know well that does the best he can
            but he's displayed in armour made of reticulated garbage cans!

            He looks so fine and fair and strong, oh how he plays the man
            and how it's prized, those galvanized, reticulated garbage cans

            The noblest Roman of them all, a good Praetorian
            a combatant who wears no pants, judst reticulated garbage cans!

            Like old Horatius at the Bridge, like the Legions of Valerian
            (O dearie me: those LOVELY knees!)
            and those reticulated garbage cans!

                         C. McCray Bethancourt

         (sung to the tune (obviously) of the 12 Days of Christmas)


1.           The first time I sent my device, The Heralds said to me

            ""It violates the Rule of Three""

2.           The next time I tried it, the Heralds said to me

            ""We changed the forms, and it violates the Rule of
             Three"".

3.           The third time I tried, and the Heralds said to me, 

            ""We upped the fees, we changed the forms, and it
             violates the Rule of Three"".

4.           Another time I tried and the Heralds said to me,
 
            ""We haven't got it, we upped the fees, we changed the 
             forms, and it violates the Rule of Three"".

5.           The fifth time I tried it, the Heralds said to me,  

            ""In a decision rendered by the College of Arms on
             August 1st, A.S. V it was decided that this style of
             heraldic design was not appropriate to the aims and 
             intentions of the Corporate Body. Holy! Holy! Holy! ""

 note: verse 5 is delivered in an extremely fast, mono-
       tone, similiar to a Gregorian Chant.

           "" ....we haven't got it, we upped the fees, we changed the forms,
             and it violates the Rule of Three.""

6.           I tried it a sixth time, and the Heralds said to me,

            ""We changed the rules, &c""

7.           A seventh time I tried and, the Heralds said to me,

            ""It's against the Rule of Tincture, we changed the

             it's against the Rule of Tincture, we changed the
             rules, &c""

10. (sung in cold anger)
             The LAST time I sent my device, the Heralds said to me

    (sung in a state of SMUG)
             ""Someone else has got it, &c""

           Once there was a Barony howling in the wilderness
           nestled in the Valley where the River doesn't flow
           and the folks were driven buggy by the insects in the Revel Hall
           Authenticity is wonderful, but this doesn't go!

                   Bugs on the Baroness, bugs on the Baroness!
                   That was the cry that you heard all the day
                   and the scratching can be heard from Ysgithr to Ered Sul
                   why did we come here? Let's go away!

           See them all a scratching, nestled in their armour tight
           the fleas have a melee team that's challenging the field!
           call Truly Nolen! Someone's gotta help us out!
           the crabs are nesting in our helms but we'll never yield!

                   (chorus)

           Dawn comes a-breaking, the bugs have won the Coronet...
           flea-infested Conan-clones in piles upon the lawn
           where is the Barony? The bugs have eaten everyone...
           termites got the stick-jocks, and all their sticks are gone!

      What the use of wearing panties
      whalebone corsets of your Auntie's
      boxer shorts and other scanties
      best of all is nude
      there's such fun in going bra-less
      now that it's no longer lawless
      'specially if your figure's flawless
      best of all is nude
      nude is what you're born in
      shirts are never torn in
      underwear and lacy flimsies, garter belts and other whimsies
      yards of itchy cloth to put your form in
      ducks all do it, maidens rue it
      even ancient Picts in Britain blue it
      going naked's how to do it
      best of all is nude!

      If your garters aren't elastic
      tie them up in knots fantastic
      (panty hose is something drastic!)
      best of all is nude!
      If you're tired of wearing clotheses
      shed your garment 'mongst the roses
      never mind the old bluenoses
      best of all is nude!
      Nude is best for ducking!
      Worst for horses bucking!
      Moonlit nights will see such sights
          that are very best for fooling round
                              .....and elbows!
      Nudity is grand to see
       a well-known antidote to virginity
      take your clothes off and you'll see:
      best of all is nude!

                    WEAPONS AT THE DOOR

 Being a Polemic concerning the alleged Custom of the West Kingdom concerning 
 checking your Weapons at the Door of the Revel Hall. As the Satire is the 
 Weapon of the Bard, this said Polemic is to be checked at the Door, along with 
 swords, knives, redheaded Ladies and other such Deadly Things.....

         As I roved out to Western Lands to take the Western Air
         I went into a Revel Hall and I saw a Twelfth Night there
         but I was halted at the gate by a Privy Consellor
                 (that's the man who tells the King of the West how to go to
                  the bath room!)
         who told me I would have to check my Weapons at the door

         As I, in my astonishment, stood hung on tenter-pegs
         a Knight came in whose Prouess hung down between his legs
         the Doorman grabbed a greatsword and he struck the Knight full sore
         and gave him a reciept; he left his weapon at the door!

         a Bard was next whose goodly Voice has entertained us all
         but he, too, was prevented from entering the Hall
         and told he could not carry deadly weapons on the floor
         he left his Voice and Harp among the weapons at the door

         a Master entered graciously, a man we all know well
         who holds a 3rd Dan Black Belt, tho this he'd never tell
         the Master struggled valiantly, the Master cursed and swore
         but he left his hands, and feet, as weapons at the door

         the company was jovial, altho a bit dismayed
         for lack of proper cutlery, down to the smallest blade
         for even teeth and fingernails, each can be used in War
         were cut, and pulled, and left behind, as weapons at the door!

         And has their King not loyal Knights that He must be afraid
         of brawling in his Hall and of Assassin's bloody blade?
         the Rights of Men to carry Arms at least WE'VE not foreswore
         and a POX on them that made the Rule of Weapons at the Door!

                           THE STREETS OF ANN ARBOR

               As I walked out thru the streets of Ann Arbor
               as I walked out thru Ann Arbor one day
               I spied a young Mongol all dressed in white linen
               all dressed in white linen and cold as the clay

               I then spied another, done in on the sidewalk
               along with just about six dozen more
               their wounds were all gaping, from mace and from braoadsword
               from claymore and cannon, all dripping with gore

               what caused this grave carnage, I cried to the Monglos
               oh pray what's the reason for this awful sight
               my answer came slowly from under the corpse-pile
               ""It seems that our bark is much worse than our bite.....""

               the answer continued from pale lips a-shaking
               we sang all our songs and believed them as true
               the Dark Horde could never be beaten in battle
               we thought this was what all good Mongols could do...

               we went down to Atenveldt all for to plunder
               ""too large to defend"" was our song every night
               but Atenveldt's different from East, West or Middle
               there, even the bushes have learned how to bite!

               the Clann stole our ponies, the Scraelings our foodstuffs
               we ran into axes in AtenViking hands
               our maidens ran off with one Richard of Arkham
               and we're all that's left to return to our lands

               MacChluarains and Monsters, Lockehaven and Foxmoor
               that Kingdom is BIG and its' fighters are MEAN!
               we fought and we lost, and fled back to Ann Arbor
               we all came back home with results that you've seen

               keep away from that Land with its' cactus and marshes
               it's no place for Mongols who are bent on War
               they count their blows well, but they strick them yet better
               he crawled into his Yurt, and fell, dead, on the floor.....

        she has got a reason, but revenge is out of season
        Oh I wish I could be King!

        If I just had the Crown on, I'd always have a frown on
        and the Barons on a string
        Heads they would be rolling, the Board would be cajoling
        Oh if only I was King!

        I am very fed up with the way this group is set up
        Oh I'd change everything!
        they are so high and mighty with the way that they do fight-ey
        Oh, someday I'll be King!

        Tho my wife is melancholic, and very...vitriolic
        she's a wasp without a sting!
        I'd have to supervise her with a pack of tranquilizers
        If I only was a King......

        (the Tin Woodsman joineth him, and singeth:)

        I grew up kind of cocky, and rather big, and stocky
        and straight as any rod
        on the field I'm a battallion, with the Ladies I'm a stallion
        ...Oh they'd better make me God!

        The other boys are jealous they say I'm over-zealous
        they'd do better to applaud
        the things that I am giving to this Dream that we are living
        oh I wish they'd make me God!

        They say that I'm conceited, but I'm just badly treated
        by people and by BoD
        just think of what they're missing by My Majesty dismissing
        Oh they'd better make me God!

        (the Cowardly Lion creepeth forth, and singeth:)

        Oh I could be a fighter, a great and mighty smiter
        and be the perfect knight
        it's a great and nasty shame, and everyone's to blame
        oh I wish that I could fight!

        Song of the Three (cont.)

        I could be a Cavalier drinking wine and ale and beer
        and be a gorgeous sight
        but it would cost me too much money so it isn't very funny
        oh I wish that I could fight!                               

        Let me at 'em on the field, I would surely make them yield
        to my Power and my Might
        with rattan, shinai and rapier they would nevermore escape here
        If they'd only let me fight

                She was afraid to come out to the Tourney
                She was worried that ""something might show..""
                She was afraid to come out to the Tourney
                And the poor thing did NOT want to go...

          Lengthy rhymes don't bother me....truth to tell: I'm lazy!

                      by William Poundstone
                              1983

     Two mentalities are at work here: 1960s rock fans and 1980s
fundamentalist Christians. The idea of phonographically concealed
messages dates from the Paul McCartney death scare of 1969. For
hard-core types, the secret-message rumors never really died. Avid
rock fans have auditioned ever album release since the late 1960s
for hidden nuances. Backward messages, barely audible messages,
and messages on one stereo track only have been alleged. At the
other end of the sociosensual spectrum, fundamentalist Christians
have gotten into the act. TV programs such as PRAISE THE LORD and
THE 700 CLUB have propagated rumors of a satanic plot in the
recording industry, no less, in which various albums conceal
""backward-masked"" demonic murmurings. If THAT sounds too spacey to
be taken seriously, consider that it was the fundamentalist groups
who were behind House Resolution 6363, a bill introduced in the
U.S. House of Representatives by Robert K. Dornan (R., Calif.) in
1982 to label all suspect records: ""WARNING: THIS RECORD CONTAINS
BACKWARD MASKING THAT MAKES A VERBAL STATEMENT WHICH IS AUDIBLE
WHEN THIS RECORD IS PLAYED BACKWARD AND WHICH MAY BE PERCEPTIBLE
AT A SUBLIMINAL LEVEL WHEN THIS RECORD IS PLAYED FORWARD."" In
February 1983, the Arkansas State Senate passed a similar record-
labeling bill by a vote of 86 to 0.
     Contributing to the quasi-occult status of these rumors is
the difficulty of checking them out on home audio equipment. You
pretty much have to take someone else's word for it, or dismiss
the rumors out of hand.
     From a technical standpoint, there are four simple ways to
conceal a verbal message on a recording. The most obvious is to
record the message at a very low volume. The message may then be
recovered by turning the volume up while playing the record or
tape. If the message is faint enough, though, noise levels of home
equipment may garble it. If the accompanying music or lyrics are
loud enough, or if the message itself is indistinct or
electronically modified, it may be hard to hear on any equipment.
     A second gimmick is to record a message on one stereo track
only. Records and tapes have two independent recordings, of
course, normally played simultaneously for stereo effect. On a
record, each stereo track occupies on one side of the V-shaped
groove for the needle. On a tape, the tracks are recorded in
parallel lanes of the magnetic material. The two tracks are called
""right"" and ""left"" after the stereo speakers they will play on.
Otherwise, the tracks are interchangeable -- the sound mixer can
put anything he or she wants on each track. A message on one track
can be masked by simultaneous loud music or lyrics on the opposite
track. With normal stereo balance (or mono equipment) the loud
track drowns out the message track. At home, single-track messages
can be recovered by adjusting the stereo balance so that only the
desired track plays. Sometimes this trick also makes indistinct
words clearer. Even if the words are not exclusively on one track,
they may happen to be more audible on one track.
     A message could be recorded at a speed different from the
rest of the record. Then the record would have to be played faster
or slower than usual to recover the message. Unless the message
was at one of the standard speeds (say, 45 rpm on a 33 1/3 rpm
record), it could not be played normally on home equipment.
     The fourth and most commonly alleged trick is to record a
verbal message backward. Reversed speech has several unexpected
features. One is that syllables are not a constant in the reversal
process. A one-syllable word can have two or three syllables when
played backward. Thus ""number nine"" in the Beatles' REVOLUTION 9
reverses to ""Turn me on, dead man"" (or something like it), a jump
from three to five syllables.
     There is no simple way to predict what a word or phrase will
sound like reversed. Obviously, you can't just reverse the
letters.
     Reversed messages are difficult to recover at home. Record
turntables are not built to go backwards. Some have a neutral
setting, in which the pickup and amplifier remain active and you
can turn the record backward by hand. But hardly anyone has a
stead enough hand to produce satisfactory results.
     With patience, it is possible to reverse a cassette
recording. Transfer the music from the original record or tape
onto a blank tape cassette. Place the cassette flat on a table.
Draw our the part of the tape with the suspected message and snip
it off at both ends. Hold the tape segment horizontally. Rotate it
180 degrees, keep it horizontal at all times. This turns the tape
end for end. Splice the reversed tape segment back onto the two
loose ends of the cassette with strong adhesive tape. Reel the
tape back inside the cassette. The sliced segment will play
backward on an ordinary cassette player.
     I rented a recording studio to test the secret-message
rumors. New copiies of the records in question were transcribed on
a quarter-inch master tape. Where rumor alleged that a single
stereo track contained a message, right and left stereo tracks
were transcribed separately. Records with alleged inaudible
messages were treated similarly. To test claims of reversed
messages, recordings on the master tape were edited out and
spliced in backward. Twenty cuts or portions of cuts from sixteen
albums were tested.


""Another One Bites the Dust""
Queen, THE GAME

Rumor: When played backward, the lyrics say, ""It's fun to smoke
marijuana.""
Findings: There is something that sounds like ""It's fun to smoke
marijuana"" in the reversed music. It is repeated over and over. It
might be rendered no less faithfully, however, as ""sfun to scout
mare wanna."" This ""message"" is the reversal of the song title,
which is repeated as a line in the song.
     Let's make a distinction between engineered and phonetic
reversals. When an artist records a verbal statement, reverses it
by turning the tape end for end, mixes the reversed statement onto
a master tape, and has records and tapes produced from the master,
that is an engineered reversal. When the phonetic properties of
song lyrics are such that they can be reversed to sound like
something else, that is a phonetic reversal.
     ""It's fun to smoke marijuna"" is clearly a phonetic reversal.
The lyrics are perfectly plain played forward (""Another one bites
the dust""), no so plain played backward (""sfun to scout mare
wanna""). With an engineered reversal, the opposite should hold
true: gibberish forward, clear as a bell backward. Some are
prepared to believe that phonetic reversals are just as
intentional as engineered reversals -- that the songwriter
painstakinginly planned the phonetic double-entendre. In the
absence of confirming evidence, that just doesn't wash. It's too
easy to find coincidences. If, for example, the letters of the
alphabet are recited in conventional fashion (Ay, Bee, Cee, etc.)
and reversed, at least five sound like English language words. D
reverses to ""eden,"" F becomes ""pray,"" S becomes ""say,"" V becomes
""even,"" and Z becomes ""easy."" ""It's fun to smoke marijuana"" is
likewise a coincidence.


""A Child is Coming""
Jefferson Starship, BLOWS AGAINST THE EMPIRE

Rumor: When played backward, ""son of Satan.""
Findings: Another phonetic coincidence. The repeated ""It's getting
better"" reverses to an iffy ""son of Satan,"" the ""of"" drawn out and
the ""Satan"" strongly accented on the first syllable.


""Eldorado""
Electric Light Orchestra, ELDORADO

Rumor: When played backward, ""He is the nasty one/ Christ, you're
infernal/ It is said we're dead men/ Everyone who has the mark
will live.""
Findings: Coincidence. The supposed message lurks around the line
""On a voyage of no return to see."" Reversed, this passage becomes
the expected syllable salad -- no one hearing it would describe it
as anything but reversed music. Only if you listen while reading
along with what you're supposed to hear will you get anything. The
rumored version of the message is somewhat fudged. The passage
sounds more like ""He's to nasty one/ Christ you are, Christ,
you're fernal/ There wiss uh, we're dead men..."" There is no ""in""
in what is taken to be ""infernal."" The line that is supposed to be
""Everyone who has the mark will live"" isn't even close, though the
syllable count is right.


""Shoo Be Doo""
The Cars, CANDY-O

Rumor: When played backward, the word ""Satan"" repeated
approximately eleven times.
Findings: Coincidence. The rumor refers to the reversal of the ""Shoo
be doo, shoo be doo, shoo be doo..."" near the end of the song. Given
the mysterious logic of reversed phonemes, these three-syllable units
can be hard as a repeated two-syllable word. The word sounds a little
like ""Satan.""


""Snowblind""
Styx, PARADISE THEATER

Rumor: According to a mimeographed list of suspect records distributed
by Congressman Dornan, the words ""Satan move through our voices"" when
played backwards.
Findings: Negative. Despite repeated listenings, it was not even
possible to identify the part of the reversed track that Dornan et al.
are talking about.


""Stairway to Heaven""
Led Zeppelin, untitled, a.k.a. STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN

Rumor: In reverse, ""I live for Satan... The Lord turns me off...
There's no escaping it... Here's to my sweet Satan... There's power in
Satan... He will give you 666.""
Findings: Coincidence. If you listen very carefully to the ""And it
makes me wonder"" lines in reverse, you'll hear something approaching
""There's no escaping it."" A better description is ""There's no escape
do."" Knock of the last syllable, and you have ""There's no escape,"" a
complete, intelligible sentence in reverse. It's there, all right, but
it's not an unlikely enough coincidence to -- well, make you wonder.
      The ""Satan"" in ""I live for Satan"" is good and clear. The ""I live
for"" part isn't. The other alleged lines are unremarkable. All are
phonetic reversals of the entirely lucid forward lyrics and obviously
just accidents.


""When Electricity Came to Arkansas""
Black Oak Arkansas, BLACK OAK ARKANSAS and RONCH AND ROLL

Rumor: In reverse, ""Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan. He is God. He
is God.""
Findings: The BLACK OAK ARKANSAS cut was reversed. Again, pairs of
reversed syllables are being freely interpreted as ""Satan."" ""He is
God"" was not identifiable.


""Rain""
The Beatles, HEY JUDE

Rumor: Unintelligible lyrics at the end are reversed.
Findings: A true engineered reversal and not really a secret. ""Rain""
seems to have been the first popular recording to incorporate an
obviously reversed lyric. The story is that John Lennon accidentally
spliced the last part of the song in backward and liked the effect.
When reversed, the strange-sounding vocals at the end become
intelligible as a reprise starting with the drawn-out word
""sunshine.""
      The reversal is less apparent to the casual listener than it
might be because the accompanying music is not reversed. The ending
fits in smoothly with the rest of the song, the vocals suggesting a
foreign language.


""Fire on High""
Electric Light Orchestra, FACE THE MUSIC

Rumor: When played backward, ""The music is reversible, but time --
turn back!""
Findings: ""Fire on High"" is instrumental. About twenty-six seconds
into the music, scrambled speech is heard. It is mostly louder than
the accompanying music and begins with a two-syllable unit repeated
several times. The seeming speech lasts for about fourteen seconds.
      Reversing the music confirms that there is a true, engineered
message. In reverse, a voice (Jeff Lynne's?) says, ""The music is
reversible, but time -- turn back! Turn back! Turn back! Turn back!""
All the words are clear and unambiguous. Anyone comparing this to the
alleged reversal on ELO's ""Eldorado"" will have no trouble telling
which is genuine.


""Goodbye Blue Sky""
Pink Floyd, THE WALL

Rumor: In reverse, ""You have discovered the secret message.""
Findings: The ""secret message"" is at the very end of the instrumental
passage following the ""Goodbye Blue Sky"" vocals. It comes just before
the words ""What shall we do"" at the start of the song that is
identified as ""Empty Spaces"" on the record label and as ""What shall we
do now?"" on the record sleeve. Played forward, the message is less
apparent than the FACE THE MUSIC reversal: A reasonably attentive
listener might play THE WALL through and not catch it. It suggests
speech not quite close enough to be overheard. In context this is not
unusual because the ""Goodbye Blue Sky"" instrumental passage includes
""airport noises"" and other sound effects. A loud climax in the music
further masks the unintelligible voice.
      When played backward, the voice (Roger Waters?) plainly intones,
""Congratulations, you have just discovered the secret message. Please
send your answer to old Pink, care of the funny farm..."" As the voice
fades out, there may be another word -- perhaps ""Chalfonte or
""Chelsea"" -- after ""funny farm.""


""Heavy Metal Poisoning""
Styx, KILROY WAS HERE

Rumor: A red sticker on the KILROY WAS HERE cover warns, ""By order of
the Majority for Musical Morality, this album contains secret backward
messages...""
Findings: This is a case of second-generation backward-masking. Styx'
PARADISE THEATER did not contain a backward message, though a lot of
people said it did. So Styx has included a sure enough backward
message on KILROY WAS HERE. It is at the very beginning of ""Heavy
Metal Poisoning."" The reversed speech last about three seconds. There
is no musical background. The words reverse to ""Annuit coeptis. Novus
ordo seclorum."" This is the Latin motto encircling the pyramid on the
back of a dollar bill. The usual translation: ""God has favored our
undertakings. A new order of the ages.""
      The cover sticker's ""Majority for Musical Morality"" is a
fictitious Falwellesque group in the KILROY WAS HERE video. Although
the sticker suggests a plurality of ""messages,"" only one was found.


Space between ""I'm So Tired"" and ""Blackbird""
The Beatles, untitled, a.k.a. THE WHITE ALBUM

Rumor: A reversed message. At the time of the Paul-is-dead stories,
the segue from ""I'm So Tired"" to ""Blackbird"" was offered as evidence.
It was held to contain John Lennon's voice, reveresed, saying ""Paul is
dead, miss him, miss him, miss him."" That interpretation seems
unlikely now, but there is a mysterious low muttering between the
songs.
Findings: The mumbling is actually just to the ""I'm So Tired"" side of
the shiny ""space"" between cuts on the record. Each of the stereo
tracks was recorded separately, twice, and a copy of each track was
reversed. This produced four versions of the two-second passage: right
forward, left forward, right reversed, and left reversed. All were
equally unintelligible. It was not even apparent whether the voice is
forward or reversed. Nor could John Lennon be identified as the
speaker. There are nine or ten syllables. The first six (when played
forward) are a two-syllable unit repeated three times. There is little
or no difference betwen the stereo tracks. Any claimed interpretation
of the sounds seems doubtful.


""Strawberry Fields Forever""
The Beatles, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR

Rumor: It was, of course, claimed that John Lennon says ""I buried
Paul"" at the end. (It's forward, at the very end after the music
fades to complete silence, returns, and starts to fade out again.)
But Lennon told ROLLING STONE that the words are ""cranberry
sauce.""
Findings: They are ""cranberry sauce."" The ""sauce""/""Paul"" part is
indistinct, but the first syllable sounds a lot more like ""cran""
than ""I.""


""Baby You're a Rich Man""
The Beatles, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR

Rumor: On one of the tracks the line ""Baby you're a rich man too""
is sung as ""Baby you're a rich fag Jew,"" a dig at Brian Epstein.
Or some think it's ""rich fat Jew"" and claim it as evidence of
Beatle anti-Semitism.
Findings: Negative. The two stereo tracks are nearly identical.
It's always possible to hear words as similar-sounding words, but
basically, the lyrics jibe with the published version.


""Revolution 9""
The Beatles, untitled, a.k.a. THE WHITE ALBUM

Rumor: Various reversed and/or one-track speech. The reversal of
""Number nine"" to ""Turn me on, dead man"" has pretty much been
discounted as coincidence (though it appears on Congressman
Dornan's list).
Findings: Distinction between lyrics and any hidden message blurs
on ""Revolution 9."" The eight-minute cut is a montage of sounds
collected by John Lennon and Yoko Ono. It includes discordant
music, radio broadcasts, sirens, applause, gunfights, sports
cheers, the crackling of a fire, screams, a baby gurgling, a choir
singing, and much that cannot be identified. For this
investigation, ""Revolution 9"" was transcribed four times, twice on
each stereo channel. One copy of each of the tracks was reversed.
The four resulting versions were compared with each other and
against the original two-channel version.
     ""Revolution 9"" contains a lot of talking. Played in stereo,
forward, the longest stretch of understandable speech is probably
an announcer saying, ""...every one of them knew that as time went
by they'd get a little bit older and a little bit slower...""
     One believable instance of reversed speech occurs: someone
saying ""Let me out! Let me out!"" (once held to represent McCartney
in his totaled Aston-Martin). Two iffy reversals occur on the
backward recording of the right stereo track:""She used to be
assistant"" and ""There were two men..."" Neither is clear enough or
long enough to be convincing. Some of the music, including the
recurring theme, sounds more natural in reverse.
     ""Turn me on, dead man"" is a typical phonetic reversal. The
forward ""number nine"" (repeated throughout the cut) is clear; the
reversal is slurred -- something like ""turn me on dedmun."" It has
been claimed that ""number nine"" must be pronounced with a British
accent or with some careful inflection in order to reverse to
""Turn me on, dead man."" This seems not to be so. As an experiment,
three American-accent renderings of ""number nine"" were reversed.
All sound about as much like ""Turn me on, dead man"" as the record
did. Like the other phonetic reversals, ""Turn me on, dead man""
must be considered a coincidence.
     Much of ""Revolution 9"" is on one stereo track only. Near the
end a voice says ""A fine natural imbalance...the Watusi...the
twist...Eldorado...Eldorado."" ""A fine natural imbalance"" is on the
right track only, though the words that follow are in stereo. One
of the longer bits of speech -- ""Who could tell what he was
saying? His voice was low and his [unintelligible] was high and
his eyes were low"" -- is clear on the left track, a bare whisper
on the right.
     There is a stereophonically concealed ""secret message"" on
""Revolution 9."" The words are on the right track. They begin about
four minutes, fifty-eight seconds into the cut and run for about
twenty-two seconds. They are not likely to be noticed in stereo
because of the much louder left track. The sound of applause
begins on the left track at about five minutes, one second into
the cut. Deafening noises -- the clapping, sirens, music --
continue on the left track until five minutes, forty seconds. It
may or may not have been Lennon's and Ono's intention to conceal
the spoken passage. Given the haphazard quality of ""Revolution 9,""
the concealment may have been accidental. To recover the passage,
the left track must be switched off. The right track can then be
heard to contain a sound like a stopwatch ticking, behind these
words:

     So the wife called, and we better go to see a
     surgeon....[A SCREAM MUFFLES A LINE THAT SOUNDS LIKE
     Well, what with the prices, the prices have snowballed,
     no wonder it's closed.] ...So any and all, we went to
     see the dentist instead, who gave him a pair of teeth,
     which wasn't any good at all. So instead of that he
     joined the bloody navy and went to sea.
                      by William Poundstone
                              1986

     There really are backward messages on rock albums. And the
controversy over ""backward masking"" and ""porn rock"" has inspired a
whole new spate of messages. There may have been more genuine
backward messages in the past few years than ever before.
     The backward message controversy is usually traced to the
1960s and John Lennon's avant-garde sound mixing on such tracks as
""Revolution 9"" on the Beatles' WHITE ALBUM. Lennon probably wasn't
trying to conceal a message so much as create an interesting
sound.
     The matter might have ended right there had it not been for
the Paul McCartney death rumor. College kids tried playing Beatles
records forward, backward, and at various speeds to find ""clues""
to McCartney's fate. In the process they found snippets of speech
from Lennon's experiments. Even after McCartney was found safe and
sound in Scotland, some listeners continued to look for hidden
messages.
     Somehow, fundamentalist Christian groups became convinced
(ca. 1982) that the alleged messages were commercials for devil
worship. Not a single indisputable satanic message has turned up,
but there were scattered attempts to ban or label certain albums.
In 1986 one fundamentalist group announced that the theme song for
the old MR. ED TV show contains the word ""Satan"" when played
backward.)
     Ironically, the publicity accorded nonexistent messages has
inspired several artists -- among them porn rock hearing witness
Frank Zappa -- to hide real background messages in their music.
It's easy to do.
     The performer speaks or sings the message normally, then
reverses the tape, which is mixed into the soundtrack. This is all
accomplished simply enough at any recording studio.
     What's not so simple is playing it back. More home record,
cassette, and compact disk players won't play backward. You can
turn a record backward with a pencil eraser, but it's not good for
the needle or the turntable. The only way to reproduce the message
with full fidelity is to use a professional-quality reel-to-reel
tape player and splice the tape in backward.
     We used the facilities of KLOS radio in Los Angeles to
reverse some recent records containing true backward messages.


""Secret Messages""
Electric Light Orchestra, SECRET MESSAGES

ELO's ELDORADO album was among those alleged to contain satanic
backward masked messages. A patient listening to ELDORADO played
backward reveals no such messages. You hear only what you ought to
hear -- the reversed lyrics of the songs, which sound nothing like
the ""messages"" claimed to be there. In the wake of such
allegations, ELO did put an (innocuous) backward message on their
FACE THE MUSIC album. Perhaps they thought this would show how
silly the allegations were. Instead, the backward-masking people
seized on this as proof that the other ""messages"" were real. In
the latest volley, ELO has named an album after the controversy.
     In Britain (where the backward-masking issue is viewed as an
American eccentricity), the cover of SECRET MESSAGES has a mock
warning label to youth about the hidden label. Word of the albums'
impending release in the United States caused enough of a furor to
chill CBS Records into deleting the cover blurb.
     The reversed message is easy to find. It's at the beginning
of the first song, which is itself called ""Secret Messages."" You
can hear reversed speech when you play the record normally. A
voice intones ""secret messages"" -- forward -- in the middle of the
reversed speech, lest anyone dare be so unhip as to not know
what's going on.
     We transferred a new copy of SECRET MESSAGES to reel-to-reel
tapes and played it backward. The backward message goes: ""WELCOME
TO THE BIG SHOW/ WELCOME TO THE BIG SHOW.""
     That's it.


""Ya Hozna""
Frank Zappa, THEM OR US

""Ya Hozna,"" a six-minute composition on the first record of the
THEM OR US double album, is ENTIRELY backward. The albums' inner
cover, which includes lyrics for the other songs, says, ""backwards
vocal -- you figure it out"" of this cut. It credits Frank and Moon
Zappa, George Duke, and Napoleon Murphy Brock as vocalists.
     Played forward, ""Ya Howza"" sounds like a record played
backward -- reasonably so. The vocals are prominent and
unintelligible. Moon Zappa's voice is curiously recognizable, even
in reverse. It is hard to tell whether the music was recorded
forward or backward.
     When ""Ya Howza"" is played in reverse, you discover that the
music is virtually a palindrome -- it sounds about the same
forward and backward. The voices are all backward. In some cases
they have been modified electronically. Many of the words are
muffled. Even after repeated careful listening on both stereo
tracks, it is difficult to make out many of the lyrics. It doesn't
help that some of the words seem to be stream-of-consciousness
nonsense. Some of the unintelligible stuff sounds like opera.
     Starting at the beginning of the reversed tape -- the end of
the forward tape -- the clearer vocals go like this: ""I am the
heaven, I am the water."" This is in a hymnlike register. ""You are
a lonely little girl./ But your mommy and your daddy hold you."" A
singsong synthesizer voice.
     The most interesting part of the lyrics is an intermittently
orgasmic rap in Moon Zappa's Valley Girl voice. There are three
short monologues:

I'm like green!
I'm like squat!
I'm like soul!
Repeat, like soul!
I'm like pull, push,
Okay, like slow, slow.

You're never too old
Like slow, like slow, like slow
Okay, I like it.


All right, faster, faster,
Go, do it, do it twice,
Yeah, that feels good,
I'm looking great,
Yeah, fer shure!
Like, no way!


""No Anchovies, Please""
J. Geils Band, LOVE STINKS

""No Anchovies, Please"" is a novelty song, really a narration with
sound effects, about a woman who is kidnapped after eating
anchovies. She is taken to a ""foreign-speaking"" country. The sound
effect of the foreign tongue seems reversed. When you do play it
in reverse, it becomes: ""It doesn't take a genius to know the
difference between chicken shit and chicken salad.""


""Darling Nikki""
Prince, PURPLE RAIN

""Darling Nikki,"" cited as porn rock before Congress, is about a
dominatrix in a hotel lobby masturbating with a magazine. In part,
the complaint was that the album cover (flowers, and Prince on a
motorcycle) wasn't explicit enough to warn kids of the suggestive
lyrics. Senator Paula Hawkins apparently was not aware of a
backward message hidden in ""Darling Nikki."" The last thirty-five
seconds of the song is gibberish. The music changes abruptly and
becomes a repeated glottal sound. Then a two-syllable sound is
repeated twice, something like ""heaven, heaven."" Unintelligible
speech follows. At the end is a sound reminiscent of rain or bacon
frying , and wind sounds.
     Played backward, the message becomes:

     Hello, how are you?
     I'm fine 'cause I know that the Lord is coming soon.
     Coming, coming soon.

     It is clearly Prince and the Revolution singing this. The
words are clear but the intonation is funny -- the linger on some
words. Perhaps this is to make the reversed message you hear
playing the record normally a little less conspicuous.
     This is a weird reversal of the supposed secret message
menace. Raunchy forward lyrics conceal a religious secret message.


""Judas Kiss""
Petra, MORE POWER TO YOU

Petra is an obscure group that sings religious songs to a rock
beat. As further proof that things have gone full circle, the
backward-masking controversy prompted Petra to include a wholesome
backward message on their MORE POWER TO YOU album. It is in the
transition between two songs, just before ""Judas Kiss."" Clearly
audible gibberish reverses to this (the husky voice a cross
between George Beverly Shea and Dee Snider): ""What are you looking
for the Devil for, when you ought to be looking for the Lord?""

AFL JoyceM Welcome to the Apple II Music & Sound chat - our discussion will
           be on NoiseTracker - the new FTA music program for the GS.  AFA
           Gene will be our host this evening...Gene, the floor is yours :)

AFA Gene   Hi all... well first I'd like to point out, if y'all aren't aware
           yet, that a spanking new version of NoiseTracker has recently
           been released (9 days ago) and is now available in our New Files
           library. It is version 0.5. I haven't played around with it much
           yet, but it's supposed to fix a lot of the little bugs in 0.3
           (the first version we had online).  NoiseTracker also includes
           the ability to directly import ""modules,"" a term used for a
           certain type of Amiga song file which has become popular among PC
           users using the SoundBlaster sound card.

           Now, via NT, these ""MOD"" files are accessible by the GS. We
           expect to see a lot of activity on this end as far as ports from
           the PC and Amiga go. Note that you should be able to go straight
           to the PC music forum and download any recently uploaded MOD
           songfiles (there was a bug in the first wide release of the PCAO
           software, however, so a bunch of files with dates between around
           March 1991 and September 1991 may not download properly. Note that
           to use these PC MOD files, you'll have to rename the downloaded
           file ""MOD.xxxxxx"" if you want it to show up automatically in NT's
           ""open"" dialog box. (On the PC, all MOD files are named
           ""xxxxxxxx.MOD"" instead.)   Also, if the files are packed with ZIP
           compression, you'll need a program from the Communications Forum
           called AGATE -- it's a terminal program that includes the ability
           to unpack ZIP files.

           Now, I guess the best thing to do would be to talk about our
           favorite songfiles... there have been a few complaints, in fact,
           that people were not being ""descriptive"" enough in their file
           descriptions for uploads in describing the songs.

AFC Eddie  ?

AFA Gene   GA ed

AFC Eddie  Once a MOD file is unpacked with Agate, is a file type change
           needed?

AFA Gene   Nope, since all that NT looks for is the ""MOD."" being the first
           four characters in the filename.

AFC Eddie  OK, Thanks!

Deanna7332 Question...

JonL7      Can you list some of the features of Noisetracker?

AFA Gene   (you don't even need that ""MOD."" if you want to type the name in
           directly.)

Deanna7332 Did any of these mod files have anything to do with FTA's ""Module
           A""

AFA Gene   Sure Jon, right after we answer Deanna's question. Deanna, you
           mean ""Modulae?""

Deanna7332 Yes, that's it.

AFA Gene   Modulae was a demo written by FTA last year. (i'll get to you in a
           sec Doors).  It used SoundSmith v0.95 for all it's music. There
           is no connection between MOD files and Modulae by FTA.

Deanna7332 Throughout the demo it said ""Loading modules""

AFA Gene   Those ""modules"" are not the same as Amiga soundfile ""modules"" --
           you see, what Modulae really was was a ""stringing together"" of a
           bunch of neat little tiny demos that FTA had written. So they
           called each little demo a ""module"" and thus the entire demo as a
           whole, ""Modulae"" (fancy plural of module?)

Deanna7332 Ok I understand.  Thank you. :)

AFL JoyceM Latin, Gene :)

AFA Gene   The term ""MODule"" from the Amiga comes from the idea that all the
           stuff needed to play the songfile (all the instruments + the
           sequence file) are included into one file, the ""module.""

TheDoors1  Gene, I have tried to d/l some recent uploaded MODs in the PC
           music area and still the problem exists.

AFA Gene   As I understand it, the problem was fixed VERY recently (correct
           me on this Joyce) and files uploaded as recently as early
           November still might not work depending on the version of the
           PCAO software that the uploader used.

AFL JoyceM Actually, Gene...I was under the impression that it had been, but
           if Doors is still having a problem, then it must not be fixed.

AFA Gene   What date was the file you tried to d/l, Door?

TheDoors1  umm 11/17, around there

AFA Gene   hmmm.... well i can tell you one thing... if it didn't work, don't
           waste your time again later... the problem is in the Apple
           software's method of d/lling files, and there are no plans to
           upgrade the Apple AO software.

AFL JoyceM I will endeavor to get an answer to that PC downloading
           problem/question :)

ThomasK63  i have a quick question... what can you use to unpack amiga mod
           files? On the PC side, that is.

TheDoors1  Agate Thomas

ELECTMUSIC Doors... what happens on after downloading..

Deanna7332 If it's LZHed you can't unless you have an IBM or
           PC/Transporter.

AFA Gene   If GS-ShrinkIt doesn't have that ability, i don't think there
           exists any such utility on the GS.

TheDoors1  What do you mean Elect?

ELECTMUSIC After you download the file... where do you encounter a problem?

TheDoors1  ok, you know when you download the file and at some point in the
           download the file starts to appear on your screen.  That's when I
           cancel it.

ThomasK63  I am sure soething good can be made w/out resorting to Amiga
           files

AFC Eddie  Yes, Doors, I believe the problem is with the PC software it was
           UL'd with.

TheDoors1  yeah Eddie.

GNO Tim    Amiga MOD files are typically compressed using LHarc.  I've
           uncompressed several on my Unix machine at school.

ThomasK63  good time for someone to make a lharc unpacker...

AFC DYAJim someone might be ;)

GNO Tim    Several people are already

AFC Eddie  Can't wait, Jim!

AFA Gene   Jon, did you have a question?

JonL7      The features of Noisetracker :)

AFA Gene   Oh yes... okay, here goes, in a nutshell, from most important to
           least:


AFA Gene   *  ability to import MOD files

           *  ability to import Soundsmith files

           *  ProDOS 8 based

           *  virtually no editing abilities (not a feature but important to
           know)

AFC DYAJim :)

AFA Gene   *  forgot: and the most important feature of all, the ability to
           hold instrument files in regular system RAM instead of DOC RAM,
           allowing for instruments far beyond the regular 64K limit found
           in ALL other GS music programs.

ThomasK63  I'll buy that!

TheDoors1  I have another question...when you're ready.

AFA Gene   GA Doors

TheDoors1  ok..is it true that NoiseTracker will take in soundsmith files and
           play them more clearly

AFA Gene   Well, as far as ""what you hear,"" yes there is a definite
           difference with some instruments. It does NOT play the sounds
           more ""clearly,"" but it just plays them in a different way. What
           many people seem to like about this ""different way"" is that
           sustained instruments (i.e. instruments designed to be played
           in a loop to simulate a long held note) seem to work better (or
           perhaps simply the way they were originally intended to work).

TheDoors1  I see

Deanna7332 Which takes up more space - MOD or NT  w/soundfile ?

AFA Gene   Deanna, it depends a few things, such as how big the sequence is,
           how many instruments you have, etc. Once you have a lot of
           assorted files, it'll probably average out to be about the same
           give or take a hundred blocks on your HD. So it basically depends
           on whether you prefer to have your instruments separate or not.

Deanna7332 Does playing quality differ with either one ?

AFA Gene   Nope. It's exactly the same either way. Loading time is the same
           too.

AFC Eddie  Can NT save songs as MOD files?

AFA Gene   Nope. It has options for Open and Close module, but these are
           still inactive.

AFA Gene   If there are no more questions, I'd like to talk about which NT
           files out there are the ""hottest,"" since this info could be
           useful to many users who are interested in downloading NT/MOD
           files.

           My personal favorite is ""Lambada,"" which is supplied by FTA with
           the program but is available separately on America
           Online.Everything about this file is really impressive except
           perhaps the sound quality of the horn-ish melody instrument.

           What about y'all, what are your favorite NT files?

AFL JoyceM Gene, there is a classical song for NT, but can't remember the
           name, but it is good.

AFC Eddie  I like Dragnet!

ELECTMUSIC So do I Ed

TheDoors1  I like Seven something

Deanna7332 My most favorite of all mod files is Pleasure Principle

AFC Eddie  <--appreciate's Greg's taste!

AFL JoyceM :)

AFA Gene   Deanna, i assume you got that from a local board?

Deanna7332 I got it from the PC forum here.

TheDoors1  I saw it there also

Deanna7332 I think under ""Pleasure""

AFA Gene   Would you be able to upload it here? If it's really that good, we
           ought to have it available directly in our oun NT lib here (BTW
           folks, we will be releasing a new NoiseTracker software library
           soon!)

AFC Eddie  What a Forum!!!

Deanna7332 That sounds great!

AFL JoyceM Gene, do you think it will be possible for synthLAB files to be
           converted to MOD files?

AFL JoyceM MOD files?

AFA Gene   I doubt it, Joyce. The formats are so diametrically opposed in
           their entire basis of their file formats that it wouldn't be
           worth the time for a programmer to develop such a convertor.

Deanna7332 Isn't it possible to move the mod file from the PC forum to our
           music library?

AFA Gene   But..... it might be worth the time for a MIDI File Format to MOD
           convertor, since these two formats are more widely accepted.

Nuzz       they have nothing better to do Gene

ELECTMUSIC Gene.. some interesting similarities with DTune and NTracker

AFA Gene   They lose the file, tho, Deanna. :)

AFL JoyceM In what way, Greg?

ELECTMUSIC Both Prodos 8

Deanna7332 Shhh they won't know a thing :)

ELECTMUSIC I also believe Bill uses a shuttling of sound data between Doc
           Ram and Ram.

AFC Eddie  Interesting, Greg.

ELECTMUSIC Thats how he gets some of the excellent instrument quality

AFC Eddie  But Diversitune has that one distinction:  MIDI input.

AFL JoyceM Deanna, we would greatly appreciate it if you would upload that
           'Pleasure' song to our library :)

ELECTMUSIC Agreed Ed.. one of the factors FTA doesn't like to incorporate
           into their programs.

Deanna7332 I'll u/l it tonight if possible.

AFL JoyceM Thanks :)

AFC Eddie  Thanks, Deanna!

AFL JoyceM I will send Bill B a copy of NoiseTracker + some MOD files...to
           see what comments we get from him (will send when I get back).

AFC DYAJim What ever happened to that diversitune upgrade that was talked
           about ?

ELECTMUSIC That would be interesting Joyce

AFC Eddie  Bill apparently still working on it, Jim.

ELECTMUSIC I am sure he would appreciate the Prodos 8

AFC DYAJim good..

AFL JoyceM Jim...RSN....he was hoping by Christmas (this year), but he is
           soooo busy with his job, who knows?

AFC DYAJim Oh yeah, I noticed the speed calcuation in NT .5 is inaccurate
           :)

AFC DYAJim I recall he has set a lot of Christmas projected dates :)

ELECTMUSIC He was one of the first ""Free Tools"" experts in breaking all the
           rules for economic sake.

AFC DYAJim like for the vaporware DT inst editor like 2 years ago.

Deanna7332 Are there any Christmas Mod or NT songs?

AFC Eddie  Oh yeah, Diversi-Editor!

AFL JoyceM I know, Jim - but that I know he has been working on.

AFC DYAJim he projected Christmas for it, and it never came :)

AFA Gene   Not yet in AMS, but hopefully the Holiday Contest will change all
           that. :)

AFC DYAJim I look foreward to any upgrades..

AFL JoyceM Not that I am aware of Deanna - you have some?  hint, hint

Deanna7332 Nope sorry.  I was hoping there were some that could be u/led
           here

AFC DYAJim I'll be breaking out the xmas tune book rsn.. I should be able to
           midi a few :) (which rules out nt)

AFL JoyceM Question...

AFC Eddie  It would be more appropriate to have a converter from Appleworks
           spreadsheet to MOD than from MIDI!

AFL JoyceM If I got ahold of an Amiga song (MOD) disk...how would I convert
           them for here?

AFA Gene   You mean an Amiga-formatted disk?

AFL JoyceM Yes

AFC DYAJim Ack.. methinks you need an amiga and a null modem cable or a
           modem.

AFA Gene   Methinks Jim is right

AFC DYAJim LOL!!  Design your music in the spreadsheet then import to NT :)
           IT might actually have better editing?!! :)

AFC Eddie  Right!

AFL JoyceM Me thinks he is right.  If I had them upload to me, would that
           work?

AFA Gene   Yep; should work like a charm.

AFC DYAJim Yah.. as long as they're coming from an amiga

AFL JoyceM Great....I will work on that when I get back  (making note now).

AFL JoyceM Gene, will you get some of those files (NT) sent to that area
           tonight?  If so, I will leave the needed message :)

AFA Gene   That's all I have planned for tonight's chat, Joyce. Yep, I'll
           move some files right now.

AFL JoyceM Thanks...

AFL JoyceM Then we should have our NoiseTracker Library by end of the week in
           AMS :)

ELECTMUSIC Gene... quick question:  Are you launching NTracker from a 3.5
           disk?

AFL JoyceM Okay, guys...I will see you all the week of December 11th (may the
           4th) as I am off on vacation.

AFA Gene   Yep greg

AFC JohnC  Where are you going?

ELECTMUSIC Do you encounter out of memory problems

AFL JoyceM Night all...and Gene, thanks for an excellent chat and great
           explanations of NoiseTracker.

Nuzz       Joyce, I have good news for FutureSound owners. SoundConvert will
           support it in the first release

AFC Eddie  Great, Mike!

AFA Gene   Greg, i always keep my RAMdisk at 0 when using noisetracker. Not
           only are

AFC JohnC  Mike...SoundConvert...released?

AFL JoyceM Great, Mike.  When can we get SoundConvert, Mike? and FutureSound
           :)

AFA Gene   there a couple of bugs with memory management, but if you're
           loading in a MOD file that's really big, NT will eat your RAMdisk.

AFC Eddie  Sounds good.

Nuzz       The manual is being ""layout"". Release date should be about 1st
           week of Dec

ELECTMUSIC Tnxs Gene

AFC JohnC  YES.......WTG Nuzz!!!!!!!!

Deanna7332 Yes, why is there on some MOD files a stop somewhere in the middle
           ?

Deanna7332 That's really frustrating!

AFL JoyceM Mike, leave me E-Mail on when and how I can send your the $$ to
           get it.

AFL JoyceM Again...night all

Nuzz       gee John, I had to do something to explain the delay :)

ELECTMUSIC Thanks Gene for a GREAT chat!

AFC Eddie  Yes, Gene!  Great!

AFA Gene   Thanks Greg, 'night!

AFA Gene   thanx, see y'all later :)

Copyright 1987 Bob Szekely.

    John Michael Osbourne, (known as ""Ozzy"" to his fans), has in his long 
career as vocalist for Black Sabbath had his work with the group misconstrued 
as advocating Satanism.  In a 1983 radio special featuring Ozzy, the 
interviewer expressed precisely this point; ""...Ozzy has always been shrouded 
in the darkest of Satanic imagery.  Yet if you really listen to his music, 
you'll find that what he is saying differs greatly from his image....""(1)  Even 
the group's image has often been described as ""occult and diabolic"".(2)

    The important point to remember here is to differentiate between appearance 
and reality.  Although the name ""Black Sabbath"" conjures up images of witches 
and sorcerers paying homage to Satan for the powers bestowed upon them, this 
does not make it safe to assume that the group that went by this name 
necessarily drew the inspiration from the occult.(3)  The closest they ever 
came to it was a gothic horror film featuring Boris Karloff as narrator; they 
adopted their name directly from the name of this film.(4)  Black Sabbath was 
involved in the black arts as much as Karloff practiced casting spells off-
screen.  Tony Iommi, the group's guitarist, summed it up best when he described 
the group as having basically ""...the same appeal as a horror movie.  It's all 
an act.""(5)










    Just as their film counterpart did, Ozzy and Sabbath found the occult 
mythos to be an effective vehicle for powerful social commentary; particularly 
when put in the context of heavy-metal rock and roll.  Ozzy himself noted that 
there are ""...people who pick up my [album] cover[s] and go...'This guy's got 
to be singing about Devil, doom, death and destruction.'  Which is not the 
case....""(6)

    The late Lester Bangs likened the group to Bob Dylan and William Burroughs, 
describing them all as ""...moralists...trying to deal with a serious present 
situation in an honest way....""(7)  Ozzy and Black Sabbath merely bring to 
light the many evils of our world in their work, to try and make us realize 
that we are all victim to their influence.  They hope to make us recognize 
these evils so that we may take up arms against them; a point Ozzy emphatically 
stresses:  ""...one thing everybody has got to understand about Black Sabbath's 
lyrics.  They're not downer lyrics, they're just telling everybody where it's 
at...""(8)  He also cites the group's most controversial tune, ""Black Sabbath"", 
as a response to the ignorant hippie culture still force when the tune was 
written in 1970:  ""The hippies said: 'The world is beautiful man.' (sic)  You 
only had to look around you to see how crappy it was.  It was ridiculous 
listening to that stuff, let alone playing it, so we just wrote about the world 
the way it really was and how it affected us - and we felt better in ourselves 
because we were really being honest....""(9)

    I   1   HAVE YOU EVER THOUGH ABOUT YOUR SOUL-
        2   CAN IT BE SAVED?
        3   OR PERHAPS YOU THINK THAT WHEN YOU ARE DEAD
        4   YOU JUST STAY IN YOUR GRAVE.
        5   IS GOD JUST A THOUGHT WITHIN YOUR HEAD OR IS
        6   HE A PART OF YOU?
        7   IS CHRIST JUST A NAME THAT YOU READ IN A BOOK
        8   WHEN YOU WERE AT SCHOOL?

    II  9   WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT DEATH DO YOU LOSE
        10  YOUR BREATH OR DO YOU KEEP YOUR COOL?
        11  WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE THE POPE ON THE END
        12  OF A ROPE - DO YOU THINK HE'S A FOOL?
        13  WELL I'VE SEEN THE TRUTH - YES I'VE SEEN 
        14  THE LIGHT AND I'VE CHANGED MY WAYS.
        15  AND I'LL BE PREPARED WHEN YOU'RE LONELY 
        16  AND SCARED AT THE END OF OUR DAYS.

    III 17  COULD IT BE YOU'RE AFRAID OF WHAT YOU'R
        18  FRIENDS MIGHT SAY 
        19  IF THEY NEW YOU BELIEVED IN GOD ABOVE
        20  THEY SHOULD REALISE BEFORE THE CRITICISE
        21  THAT GOD IS THE ONLY WAY TO LOVE.

    IV  23  IS YOUR MIND SO SMALL THAT YOU HAVE TO FALL
        24 IN WITH THE PACK WHEREVER THEY RUN
        25  WILL YOU STILL SNEER WHEN DEATH IS NEAR
        26  AND SAY THEY MAY AS WELL WORSHIP THE SUN.

    V   27  I THINK IT WAS TRUE IT WAS PEOPLE LIKE YOU
        28  THAT CRUCIFIED CHRIST
        29  I THINK IT IS SAD THE OPINION YOU HADE WAS THE
        30  ONLY ONE VOICED.
        31  WILL YOU BE SO SURE WHEN YOUR DAY IS NEAR
        32  SAY YOU DON'T BELIEVE?
        33  YOU HAD THE CHANCE BUT YOU TURNED IT DOWN
        34  NOW YOU CAN'T RETRIEVE.










    VI  35  PERHAPS YOU'LL THINK BEFORE YOU SAY THAT
        36  GOD IS DEAD AND GONE
        37  OPEN YOUR EYES, JUST REALIZE THAT HE IS THE
        38  ONE.
        39  THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN SAVE YOU KNOW FROM
        40  ALL THIS SIN AND HATE.
        41  OR WILL YOU STILL JEER AT ALL YOU HEAR?
        42  YES!-I THINK IT'S TOO LATE.

    In this piece, the group asserts a belief in an afterlife and spiritual 
redemption.  As grisly as the image of a hanged pontiff is, its shock value is 
a necessary part of the message:  They reject religious dogma, stating that a 
belief in God, in one's own heart, is the only guiding light to help one inn 
his life (lines 11/12, 39/40).  Furthermore, the reject religious hypocrisy 
(lines 5/6, 7/8) and peer pressure (verses III, IV) as excuses for not 
accepting God.  To clarify further:  following the crowd does not justify 
shrugging responsibility for one's own actions.

    After re-reading, it becomes obvious that this song is an ascerbic critique 
of atheism; (line 35/36) I refer here again to verses three and four.  In these 
two verses, the picture painted in one of Godless conformity and how it's 
viewed as being as foolish as Paganism.  These lyrics set an example for the 
listener by relating personal experience (lines 13-16).  However, for those who 
cannot accept this the group has no recourse but to condemn them, although 
rather ironically; they hope that their rhetorical loss of faith in the 
listener will open his eyes (line 42).










                           B L A C K   S A B B A T H 



            WHAT IS THIS, THAT STANDS BEFORE ME?
            FIGURE IN BLACK, WHICH POINTS AT ME
            TURN ROUND QUICK AND START TO RUN
            FIND OUT I'M THE CHOSEN ONE.  OH, NO!
            
            BIG BLACK SHAPE WITH EYES OF FIRE
            TELLING PEOPLE THEIR DESIRE
            SATAN'S SITTING THERE, HE'S SMILING
            WATCHES THOSE FLAMES GET HIGHER AND HIGHER
            OH, NO, NO, -- PLEASE GOD HELP ME!
            
                IS THIS THE END MY FRIEND?
                SATAN'S COMING 'ROUND THE BEND
                PEOPLE RUNNING 'CAUSE THEY'RE SCARED
                THE PEOPLE BETTER GO AND BEWARE
                NO, NO!  PLEASE--NO!!
                
                
    The all time controversy winner!  Is this not irrefutably  THE song about 
Black Magic in rock?  It's all so obvious, suffuse with evil imagery; Satan, 
walls of flame, figure in black, and damnation at the end.  Yes, I see the 
images too; it definitely concerns Black Magic.  Then again, Shakespeare's 
Macbeth employed scenes of witches involved in conjurations; does that mean 
that Shakespeare was a warlock?  Poe used to write sardonic tragedies about 
twisted murderers and the bizarre nature of acts, did that make him an evil, 
leering, demented killer?  Did either of them advocated what they wrote about?  
One has to remember that writing about something is not necessarily the same as 
emulating it.  Tony Iommi spoke out quite strongly about this:  ""People are 
bringing us down saying that we are a Black Magic group.  I think they must be










getting mixed up with Black Widow.  We don't do any sacrifices on stage, and 
we're not on a black magic kick.  We wanted to do heavy numbers and the guitar 
riffs we worked out were more suited to evil things than love.  We play songs 
about black magic, but they are more likely to be against than for it.""(12)  

    By now, you're probably asking yourself who Black Widow is, right?  Then 
it's time for a little history:

        Sabbath, before they were known as Sabbath, had the same line-up but 
two earlier names.  The first one was Polka Tulk, which seemed sure to doom 
them to obscurity.(13)  The soon realized this and changed the group's name to 
Earth.  Now, Earth was a blues band at the end of the English blues boom.  As 
if that wasn't bad enough, they soon discovered that not only was there another 
group named Earth, but they had also released a single.  To avoid confusion, 
they changed their name again.(14)  But what made them decide on that name?  
Just ask Ozzy:  ""I just liked the name Black Sabbath because of the succession 
of vowel sounds.(15)  If that sounds ludicrous just consider this:  Sabbath was 
""...the first of the really committed, loud and heavy bands...""(16)  They 
needed a name to match the gut-wrenching power they were developing.  Tony knew 
that he wanted Sabbath to be noticed above all the rest of the British blues 
bands:  ""We wanted something of our own that we'd like and people would like.  
And we wanted something loud!""










    Tony didn't hate the blues.  He'd cut his teeth as a guitarist on the likes 
of The Shadows, Buddy Holly and Django Rheinhardt, developing his own style 
from there.  But he realized the group had no future in the blues:

        'We couldn't keep playing 12-bars forever.  We just got fed up with 
Earth music.  It was jazz, blues stuff.  It was good for practice but nothing 
else.'

    In the late 'Sixties, blues groups were a dime a dozen in Birmingham and 
interest was waning in the blues boom due to the glut of groups.  One man, by 
the name of Jim Simpson, had heard Earth around the Birmingham club circuit and 
understood what they were trying to do.  He decided to take them under his 
wing.  With the aid of his massive record collection, Jim expanded the group's 
horizons in the areas of jazz and blues.  He introduced them to artists like 
Wes Montgomery, Count Basie and Jimmy Rushing.  It was from Rushing in 
particular that they derived the repetitive riff style so readily noticeable in 
their later incarnation as Black Sabbath.

    The Count Basie influence is evidenced in the song ""Wicked World"" from the 
first album; Sabbath drummer Bill Ward uses a ""'sighing hi-hat'...in the manner 
of Basie's drummer Jo Jones.""










    The influence is subtle, almost subliminal.  Yet it is one which was not 
thought capable of hard, 'heavy' rock bands in the late 'Sixties.  Although Led 
Zeppelin and Jimi Hendrix also had their work steeped in blues and jazz 
derivations (Hendrix' ""Third Stone From the Sun"" and Zeppelin's version of 
Willie Dixon's ""I Can't Quit You Baby"" from their first album), neither was 
able to match the intense energy of Black Sabbath.  Iommi has always had a 
preference for music with an original, distinct style of its' own; as an 
example, he mentions guitarists Joe Pass and Alvin Lee as two of his strongest 
songwriting influences.

    It would also be necessary that Sabbath develop a unique, distinctive style 
and image of their own.  Though they had changed their name from Earth to Black 
Sabbath to avoid confusion with the other Earth; at the same time another group 
emerged by the name of Black Widow ""...who WERE profoundly influenced by the 
occult, had a male witch as a patron, and wrote pieces like ""Come to The 
Sabbat.""  Unfortunately, Sabbath was constantly reaping the benefits of Widow's 
publicity.

    Sabbath was a group that never minced words.  If they saw something as 
destructive, they would be sure to rub the listener's face it it.  They did not 
want their point to be missed.

    With their straightforward, sometimes brutal way of looking at things, they 
try to shock the listener's conscience back into awareness.  The imagery of 
""Hand of Doom"", from the Paranoid album, is candid and condemning; it is a 
strong statement against drug addiction and rightly so...

            YOU DON'T WANNA LEARN
            PRICE OF LIFE YOU CRY
            NOW YOU'RE GONNA DIE
            
            
    Many people felt the group's overall direction was pessimistic and had a 
negative effect on its listener's due to that.  ""Ozzy insisted that if people 
thought he was having a bad effect on the minds of young kids, they should go 
and watch the TV news where real murder and mayhem were a way of life, and 
shown night after night."" (18)

    Sabbath was never negative in their message; they were simply truthful 
about waht they saw as wrong in the world.  If you ""Strip away the horror 
stories, the imagery and the hysteria, (and) turn down the amps a notch...you 
have a well-rehearsed, solid blues and rock band, powered by a dedication to 
well defined objectives.""  On the top of the list of those objectives was 
truth; Sabbath never feared facing that truth squarely, regardless of what many 
people thought of them.

Long, long, time ago,
I can still remember,
When the local calls were ""free"".
And I knew if I paid my bill,
And never wished them any ill,
That the phone company would let me be...

But Uncle Sam said he knew better,
Split 'em up, for all and ever!
We'll foster competition:
It's good capital-ism!

I can't remember if I cried,
When my phone bill first tripled in size.
But something touched me deep inside,
The day... Bell System... died.

And we were singing...

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

Is your office Step by Step,
Or have you gotten some Crossbar yet?
Everybody used to ask...
Oh, is TSPS coming soon?
IDDD will be a boon!
And, I hope to get a Touch-Tone phone, real soon...

The color phones are really neat,
And direct dialing can't be beat!
My area code is ""low"":
The prestige way to go!

Oh, they just raised phone booths to a dime!
Well, I suppose it's about time.
I remember how the payphones chimed,
The day... Bell System... died.

And we were singing...

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

Back then we were all at one rate,
Phone installs didn't cause debate,
About who'd put which wire where...
Installers came right out to you,
No ""phone stores"" with their ballyhoo,
And 411 was free, seemed very fair!

But FCC wanted it seems,
To let others skim long-distance creams,
No matter 'bout the locals,
They're mostly all just yokels!

And so one day it came to pass,
That the great Bell System did collapse,
In rubble now, we all do mass,
The day... Bell System... died.

So bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

I drove on out to Murray Hill,
To see Bell Labs, some time to kill,
But the sign there said the Labs were gone.
I went back to my old CO,
Where I'd had my phone lines, years ago,
But it was empty, dark, and ever so forlorn...

No relays pulsed,
No data crooned,
No MF tones did play their tunes,
There wasn't a word spoken,
All carrier paths were broken...

And so that's how it all occurred,
Microwave horns just nests for birds,
Everything became so absurd,
The day... Bell System... died.

So bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

We were singing:

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?

We will have a mighty Party           It was good enough for Sappho
In the honor of Astarte               With her lady on her lap-o
Grab your chiton - don't be tardy     She put Lesbos on the map-o
'Cause she's good enough for me!      With her pagan poetry!

Shall we sing a verse for Venus,    Well the Christians all are humming
Of the Gods she is the meanest,     Cause they say their God is coming,
Cause she bit me on my...elbow      Our God came three times this evening
And it's good enough for me.        And that's good enough for me.

                                             (Atenveldt Verses)

   Now here's a story, a little bit gory,
   A little bit happy, a little bit sad.
   About a drink called Imperium Compound
   And how the SCA's been had!                       

   Chorus: Oh we think, we think, we think,
           The King is a fink, a fink, a fink,
           A figure of respectability
           Rules the Kingdom thru Imperium Compound
           The results are plain to see!

   Mongol Hordemen, those free-living swordsmen
   Subverting the Kingdoms from underneath!
   Have no use for Imperium Compound
   Except perhaps to brush their teeth!

   AltChorus: Oh we fink, we fink, we fink,
              The Khan and the Kink, the Kink, the Kink,
              And the Board, their Great Senilities!
              The Western Irgun, drinks Imperium Compound
              And we're BACK, with results you'll see!    

   Lady Laurel, with Authority Royal,
   Passes and rejects our heraldry
   She needs a swig of Imperium Compound
   Then perhaps she'd deign to talk to me!            

   Lady Trude thought it her duty
   To turn a social wrong into a Right
   Proved her point with Imperium Compound
   And showed that Cheshire Cats can fight!  //and scratch//

   The Board of Directors styled themselves The Electors
   And another con they tried to swing
   Now the BoD drinks Imperium Compound
   So we no longer need a King!                        

   AltChorus: Oh the Bod, the BoD, the BoD,
              It thinks it is God, is God, is God,
              The figure of Supreme Authority!
              And if we O.D.'d on Imperium Compund
              there'd be no need for Royalty!          

   Oh, MEDIEVAL Net, we thought it was all wet
   With witty remarks, and other kinds of sass
   We'll feed our computers on Imperium Compound
   And BYTE the BoD right on its' righteous ass!         

   Good old Duncan was often drunken
   Chasing all the ladies fair
   He bathed himself in Imperium Compound
   Now he has a little savoir faire!

  ATEN IMPERIUM (cont.)

   Ioseph of Locksley, never changes his socks, he
   Runs around looking like a Cavalier,
   He stocked up on Imperium Compound
   And he has enough to last for years and years!        

   AltChorus: Oh they forgot, forgot, forgot
              The Locks-e-ly Plot, the Plot, the Plot!
              And it works the best when it is underground!
              It isn't a hassle for a green-and-white tassle
              They're the ones that BREW Imperium Compound!  

   Trelon of the Wood, he was very good, he
   Was a leader that had never been beat before;
   But Caid had Imperium Compound,
   And Imperial Roman Caid won the War!  //with help!//   

   In Tyr Ysgithr, it's regularly whispered there
   That the Kingdom is ruled over by a King    // What's THAT? //
   They're ""democratic"" and quite erratic....
   They've forgot the purpose of the whole damn thing!     

   King Sir Mark von, with his pretty white suit on,
   Rules the Kingdom both with Grace and Purity!
   He never touches Imperium Compound
   At least not where anyone else can see!               

   Duke Sir Deaton, was never beaten
   On the field, or in the drinking hall;
   At the Catbox War with Caid,
   Left thirty bodies piled against the wall!             

   Denis O'Titans was good at smitin'
   A Locksley Monster in every single way!
   Drank a little Imperium Compound
   And ATE Deaton's sword that day  // No! REALLY! //

        Last night I had the strangest dream in this bleak century
        I dreamed that people the world around believed in Chivalry

        I dreamed I saw a Kingly Crown enshrined in laurel leaves
        with Grace and Joy and Purity attendant at his feet

        I dreamed I saw the perfect Knight receive his accolade
        and minstrels sang and children laughed in some soft forest glade

        I dreamed I saw the finest thing that ever man could make
        grow great and strong and undefiled: Pray God I never wake!

        Last night I had the strangest dream in this bleak century
        I dreamed that people the world around believed in Chivalry

               (to the tune of ""Good King Wenceslaus"")

                Locksley Monsters never yield
                on the field of battle
                strike the helm and bash the shield
                make their eyeteeth rattle
                Bodies on the ground will lie
                bones will burst in sunder
                search for Locksleys' enemies:
                You'll find them six feet under!

            There is a man who we know well that does the best he can
            but he's displayed in armour made of reticulated garbage cans!

            He looks so fine and fair and strong, oh how he plays the man
            and how it's prized, those galvanized, reticulated garbage cans

            The noblest Roman of them all, a good Praetorian
            a combatant who wears no pants, judst reticulated garbage cans!

            Like old Horatius at the Bridge, like the Legions of Valerian
            (O dearie me: those LOVELY knees!)
            and those reticulated garbage cans!

         (sung to the tune (obviously) of the 12 Days of Christmas)


1.           The first time I sent my device, The Heralds said to me

            ""It violates the Rule of Three""

2.           The next time I tried it, the Heralds said to me

            ""We changed the forms, and it violates the Rule of
             Three"".

3.           The third time I tried, and the Heralds said to me, 

            ""We upped the fees, we changed the forms, and it
             violates the Rule of Three"".

4.           Another time I tried and the Heralds said to me,
 
            ""We haven't got it, we upped the fees, we changed the 
             forms, and it violates the Rule of Three"".

5.           The fifth time I tried it, the Heralds said to me,  

            ""In a decision rendered by the College of Arms on
             August 1st, A.S. V it was decided that this style of
             heraldic design was not appropriate to the aims and 
             intentions of the Corporate Body. Holy! Holy! Holy! ""

 note: verse 5 is delivered in an extremely fast, mono-
       tone, similiar to a Gregorian Chant.

           "" ....we haven't got it, we upped the fees, we changed the forms,
             and it violates the Rule of Three.""

6.           I tried it a sixth time, and the Heralds said to me,

            ""We changed the rules, &c""

7.           A seventh time I tried and, the Heralds said to me,

            ""It's against the Rule of Tincture, we changed the
             rules, &c""

8.           I tried it once again and the heralds said to me,

            ""It's not a Period design, It's against the Rule of Tincture, We
             changed the rules, &c""

    Heralds Said To Me (cont.)

9.           I sent it in once more, and the Heralds said to me,

            ""We changed the rules again, It's not a Period design,
             it's against the Rule of Tincture, we changed the
             rules, &c""

10. (sung in cold anger)
             The LAST time I sent my device, the Heralds said to me

    (sung in a state of SMUG)
             ""Someone else has got it, &c""




              (nb: every single one of these reasons has been used by the
              CoA, at one point or another, to reject perfectly good
              heraldry, along with some even MORE stupid.  If the shoe

   or: There may be Lice on all you Knice, but there ain't no Lice on me

           Once there was a Barony howling in the wilderness
           nestled in the Valley where the River doesn't flow
           and the folks were driven buggy by the insects in the Revel Hall
           Authenticity is wonderful, but this doesn't go!

                   Bugs on the Baroness, bugs on the Baroness!
                   That was the cry that you heard all the day
                   and the scratching can be heard from Ysgithr to Ered Sul
                   why did we come here? Let's go away!

           See them all a scratching, nestled in their armour tight
           the fleas have a melee team that's challenging the field!
           call Truly Nolen! Someone's gotta help us out!
           the crabs are nesting in our helms but we'll never yield!

                   (chorus)

           Dawn comes a-breaking, the bugs have won the Coronet...
           flea-infested Conan-clones in piles upon the lawn
           where is the Barony? The bugs have eaten everyone...
           termites got the stick-jocks, and all their sticks are gone!

                  For oft I thought of mighty men
                  who carved a Land with sword and pen
                  and lit a candle, burning bright,
                  that pierced the darkness; stirred the night!
                  tho some are gone their deeds remain

                  sing: Oh, their deeds were not in vain!
                  in sunlit days
                  and falling rain.....

                  So raise your banners, blazoned bright
                  Advance the Dream and Shine the Light!
                  in battle's crash and Revel's song

                  I love you best, my Atenveldt!
                  Sing: Oh the Joy that I have felt!

      What the use of wearing panties
      whalebone corsets of your Auntie's
      boxer shorts and other scanties
      best of all is nude
      there's such fun in going bra-less
      now that it's no longer lawless
      'specially if your figure's flawless
      best of all is nude
      nude is what you're born in
      shirts are never torn in
      underwear and lacy flimsies, garter belts and other whimsies
      yards of itchy cloth to put your form in
      ducks all do it, maidens rue it
      even ancient Picts in Britain blue it
      going naked's how to do it
      best of all is nude!

      If your garters aren't elastic
      tie them up in knots fantastic
      (panty hose is something drastic!)
      best of all is nude!
      If you're tired of wearing clotheses
      shed your garment 'mongst the roses
      never mind the old bluenoses
      best of all is nude!
      Nude is best for ducking!
      Worst for horses bucking!
      Moonlit nights will see such sights
          that are very best for fooling round
                              .....and elbows!
      Nudity is grand to see
       a well-known antidote to virginity
      take your clothes off and you'll see:
      best of all is nude!

                   the Legion with it's Eagles bright
                   marched into the Pictish night
                   met them there upon the sand
                   gave em up to the Wicker Man!

                   eight-legged steed and hound of Hel
                   the one-eyed Man, he loves ya well

                   are you then feared of the dark?

                   The Circle forms, the Circle flows
                   the Circle goes where no man knows
                   Hail to the Lady, one in three:
                   Present is Past and Past is Me!

                   Rhiannon's Birds are still in flight

 Being a Polemic concerning the alleged Custom of the West Kingdom concerning 
 checking your Weapons at the Door of the Revel Hall. As the Satire is the 
 Weapon of the Bard, this said Polemic is to be checked at the Door, along with 
 swords, knives, redheaded Ladies and other such Deadly Things.....

         As I roved out to Western Lands to take the Western Air
         I went into a Revel Hall and I saw a Twelfth Night there
         but I was halted at the gate by a Privy Consellor

         who told me I would have to check my Weapons at the door

         As I, in my astonishment, stood hung on tenter-pegs
         a Knight came in whose Prouess hung down between his legs
         the Doorman grabbed a greatsword and he struck the Knight full sore
         and gave him a reciept; he left his weapon at the door!

         a Bard was next whose goodly Voice has entertained us all
         but he, too, was prevented from entering the Hall
         and told he could not carry deadly weapons on the floor
         he left his Voice and Harp among the weapons at the door

         a Master entered graciously, a man we all know well
         who holds a 3rd Dan Black Belt, tho this he'd never tell
         the Master struggled valiantly, the Master cursed and swore
         but he left his hands, and feet, as weapons at the door

         the company was jovial, altho a bit dismayed
         for lack of proper cutlery, down to the smallest blade
         for even teeth and fingernails, each can be used in War
         were cut, and pulled, and left behind, as weapons at the door!

         And has their King not loyal Knights that He must be afraid
         of brawling in his Hall and of Assassin's bloody blade?
         the Rights of Men to carry Arms at least WE'VE not foreswore
         and a POX on them that made the Rule of Weapons at the Door!

                           THE STREETS OF ANN ARBOR

               As I walked out thru the streets of Ann Arbor
               as I walked out thru Ann Arbor one day
               I spied a young Mongol all dressed in white linen
               all dressed in white linen and cold as the clay

               I then spied another, done in on the sidewalk
               along with just about six dozen more
               their wounds were all gaping, from mace and from braoadsword
               from claymore and cannon, all dripping with gore

               what caused this grave carnage, I cried to the Monglos
               oh pray what's the reason for this awful sight
               my answer came slowly from under the corpse-pile
               ""It seems that our bark is much worse than our bite.....""

               the answer continued from pale lips a-shaking
               we sang all our songs and believed them as true
               the Dark Horde could never be beaten in battle
               we thought this was what all good Mongols could do...

               we went down to Atenveldt all for to plunder
               ""too large to defend"" was our song every night
               but Atenveldt's different from East, West or Middle
               there, even the bushes have learned how to bite!

               the Clann stole our ponies, the Scraelings our foodstuffs
               we ran into axes in AtenViking hands
               our maidens ran off with one Richard of Arkham
               and we're all that's left to return to our lands

               MacChluarains and Monsters, Lockehaven and Foxmoor
               that Kingdom is BIG and its' fighters are MEAN!
               we fought and we lost, and fled back to Ann Arbor
               we all came back home with results that you've seen

               keep away from that Land with its' cactus and marshes
               it's no place for Mongols who are bent on War
               they count their blows well, but they strick them yet better
               he crawled into his Yurt, and fell, dead, on the floor.....

                       SONG OF THE THREE

                            C. A. Bethancourt III
       tune: the song of the Cowardly Lion, Tin Woodsman and Scarecrow
             in the movie version of the Wizard of Oz

        (Enter the Scarecrow, who singeth:)

        My wife is always nagging; my Prowess it is lagging
        I can't do anything
        she has got a reason, but revenge is out of season
        Oh I wish I could be King!

        If I just had the Crown on, I'd always have a frown on
        and the Barons on a string
        Heads they would be rolling, the Board would be cajoling
        Oh if only I was King!

        I am very fed up with the way this group is set up
        Oh I'd change everything!
        they are so high and mighty with the way that they do fight-ey
        Oh, someday I'll be King!

        Tho my wife is melancholic, and very...vitriolic
        she's a wasp without a sting!
        I'd have to supervise her with a pack of tranquilizers
        If I only was a King......

        (the Tin Woodsman joineth him, and singeth:)

        I grew up kind of cocky, and rather big, and stocky
        and straight as any rod
        on the field I'm a battallion, with the Ladies I'm a stallion
        ...Oh they'd better make me God!

        The other boys are jealous they say I'm over-zealous
        they'd do better to applaud
        the things that I am giving to this Dream that we are living
        oh I wish they'd make me God!

        They say that I'm conceited, but I'm just badly treated
        by people and by BoD
        just think of what they're missing by My Majesty dismissing
        Oh they'd better make me God!

        (the Cowardly Lion creepeth forth, and singeth:)

        Oh I could be a fighter, a great and mighty smiter
        and be the perfect knight
        it's a great and nasty shame, and everyone's to blame
        oh I wish that I could fight!

        Song of the Three (cont.)

        I could be a Cavalier drinking wine and ale and beer
        and be a gorgeous sight
        but it would cost me too much money so it isn't very funny
        oh I wish that I could fight!                               

        Let me at 'em on the field, I would surely make them yield
        to my Power and my Might
        with rattan, shinai and rapier they would nevermore escape here
        If they'd only let me fight

                She was afraid to come out to the Tourney
                She was worried that ""something might show..""
                She was afraid to come out to the Tourney
                And the poor thing did NOT want to go...

                  (2 - 3 - 4, tell the people what she wore!)

                  It was an itsy bitsy teeny weenie little rabbit fur bikini

                  An itsy bitsy teenie weenie little rabbit fur bikini
                  And in her apartment she wanted to stay!

                One day in the Kingdom of the Middle
                It happened at a Tourney one day:
                The Mongols invaded the Middle
                But the Middle did not want to play...

                  (eins - zwei - drei, but the Dark Horde wouldn't die!)

                  It was an itsy bitsy tiny teenie Nauseating Mongol weenie

                It was cold, and disgusting, and greasy
                And I just want to upchuck and die!

          Tom O'Bedlam's son am I, for my mind is hazy!
          I'd rather sing a song than work (if it's not too phrasey!)
          Lengthy rhymes don't bother me....truth to tell: I'm lazy!

          Yang, your yurt is very nice, and your Horde is smelly,
          And I'm sure that yak-meat will nicely fill one's belly!
          But remember this one line, or you're not worth jelly:
          FIRST you plunder, THEN you burn! That's how to be rakehelly!

          My Lady Lorelei your eyes do drive me to distraction
          And the lovely Care-Cheri causes....petrifaction!
          But I, and they, quite taken are, so I can't take action...
          Therefore, Ladies, fill my cup; I'll drink to stupefaction!

          Now Atenveldt your fighters, all, are most good and gentle
          And the Ladies, bless 'em all, are most ornamental!
          But that little Nikki-Toad....has me sentimental
          Though with boffer in her hand she is argumental!

          This stupid little song, m'lords, is mostly sung in Latin
          By the Goliards, of course, from vespers clear to matins!
          But I prefer a coarser cloth over silk or satins
          English is more understood, mine enemies to flatten!

          Good People all, I've made my Song, its' music's well-recited
          But my voice could use some work; the flowers it has blighted!
          It's rude and rusty, grim and bad, and squeaky like a door-hinge,
          But I'm a better Bard than you: I found a rhyme for ""orange!""

                      by William Poundstone
                              1983

     Two mentalities are at work here: 1960s rock fans and 1980s
fundamentalist Christians. The idea of phonographically concealed
messages dates from the Paul McCartney death scare of 1969. For
hard-core types, the secret-message rumors never really died. Avid
rock fans have auditioned ever album release since the late 1960s
for hidden nuances. Backward messages, barely audible messages,
and messages on one stereo track only have been alleged. At the
other end of the sociosensual spectrum, fundamentalist Christians
have gotten into the act. TV programs such as PRAISE THE LORD and
THE 700 CLUB have propagated rumors of a satanic plot in the
recording industry, no less, in which various albums conceal
""backward-masked"" demonic murmurings. If THAT sounds too spacey to
be taken seriously, consider that it was the fundamentalist groups
who were behind House Resolution 6363, a bill introduced in the
U.S. House of Representatives by Robert K. Dornan (R., Calif.) in
1982 to label all suspect records: ""WARNING: THIS RECORD CONTAINS
BACKWARD MASKING THAT MAKES A VERBAL STATEMENT WHICH IS AUDIBLE
WHEN THIS RECORD IS PLAYED BACKWARD AND WHICH MAY BE PERCEPTIBLE
AT A SUBLIMINAL LEVEL WHEN THIS RECORD IS PLAYED FORWARD."" In
February 1983, the Arkansas State Senate passed a similar record-
labeling bill by a vote of 86 to 0.
     Contributing to the quasi-occult status of these rumors is
the difficulty of checking them out on home audio equipment. You
pretty much have to take someone else's word for it, or dismiss
the rumors out of hand.
     From a technical standpoint, there are four simple ways to
conceal a verbal message on a recording. The most obvious is to
record the message at a very low volume. The message may then be
recovered by turning the volume up while playing the record or
tape. If the message is faint enough, though, noise levels of home
equipment may garble it. If the accompanying music or lyrics are
loud enough, or if the message itself is indistinct or
electronically modified, it may be hard to hear on any equipment.
     A second gimmick is to record a message on one stereo track
only. Records and tapes have two independent recordings, of
course, normally played simultaneously for stereo effect. On a
record, each stereo track occupies on one side of the V-shaped
groove for the needle. On a tape, the tracks are recorded in
parallel lanes of the magnetic material. The two tracks are called
""right"" and ""left"" after the stereo speakers they will play on.
Otherwise, the tracks are interchangeable -- the sound mixer can
put anything he or she wants on each track. A message on one track
can be masked by simultaneous loud music or lyrics on the opposite
track. With normal stereo balance (or mono equipment) the loud
track drowns out the message track. At home, single-track messages
can be recovered by adjusting the stereo balance so that only the
desired track plays. Sometimes this trick also makes indistinct
words clearer. Even if the words are not exclusively on one track,
they may happen to be more audible on one track.
     A message could be recorded at a speed different from the
rest of the record. Then the record would have to be played faster
or slower than usual to recover the message. Unless the message
was at one of the standard speeds (say, 45 rpm on a 33 1/3 rpm
record), it could not be played normally on home equipment.
     The fourth and most commonly alleged trick is to record a
verbal message backward. Reversed speech has several unexpected
features. One is that syllables are not a constant in the reversal
process. A one-syllable word can have two or three syllables when
played backward. Thus ""number nine"" in the Beatles' REVOLUTION 9
reverses to ""Turn me on, dead man"" (or something like it), a jump
from three to five syllables.
     There is no simple way to predict what a word or phrase will
sound like reversed. Obviously, you can't just reverse the
letters.
     Reversed messages are difficult to recover at home. Record
turntables are not built to go backwards. Some have a neutral
setting, in which the pickup and amplifier remain active and you
can turn the record backward by hand. But hardly anyone has a
stead enough hand to produce satisfactory results.
     With patience, it is possible to reverse a cassette
recording. Transfer the music from the original record or tape
onto a blank tape cassette. Place the cassette flat on a table.
Draw our the part of the tape with the suspected message and snip
it off at both ends. Hold the tape segment horizontally. Rotate it
180 degrees, keep it horizontal at all times. This turns the tape
end for end. Splice the reversed tape segment back onto the two
loose ends of the cassette with strong adhesive tape. Reel the
tape back inside the cassette. The sliced segment will play
backward on an ordinary cassette player.
     I rented a recording studio to test the secret-message
rumors. New copiies of the records in question were transcribed on
a quarter-inch master tape. Where rumor alleged that a single
stereo track contained a message, right and left stereo tracks
were transcribed separately. Records with alleged inaudible
messages were treated similarly. To test claims of reversed
messages, recordings on the master tape were edited out and
spliced in backward. Twenty cuts or portions of cuts from sixteen
albums were tested.


""Another One Bites the Dust""
Queen, THE GAME

Rumor: When played backward, the lyrics say, ""It's fun to smoke
marijuana.""
Findings: There is something that sounds like ""It's fun to smoke
marijuana"" in the reversed music. It is repeated over and over. It
might be rendered no less faithfully, however, as ""sfun to scout
mare wanna."" This ""message"" is the reversal of the song title,
which is repeated as a line in the song.
     Let's make a distinction between engineered and phonetic
reversals. When an artist records a verbal statement, reverses it
by turning the tape end for end, mixes the reversed statement onto
a master tape, and has records and tapes produced from the master,
that is an engineered reversal. When the phonetic properties of
song lyrics are such that they can be reversed to sound like
something else, that is a phonetic reversal.
     ""It's fun to smoke marijuna"" is clearly a phonetic reversal.
The lyrics are perfectly plain played forward (""Another one bites
the dust""), no so plain played backward (""sfun to scout mare
wanna""). With an engineered reversal, the opposite should hold
true: gibberish forward, clear as a bell backward. Some are
prepared to believe that phonetic reversals are just as
intentional as engineered reversals -- that the songwriter
painstakinginly planned the phonetic double-entendre. In the
absence of confirming evidence, that just doesn't wash. It's too
easy to find coincidences. If, for example, the letters of the
alphabet are recited in conventional fashion (Ay, Bee, Cee, etc.)
and reversed, at least five sound like English language words. D
reverses to ""eden,"" F becomes ""pray,"" S becomes ""say,"" V becomes
""even,"" and Z becomes ""easy."" ""It's fun to smoke marijuana"" is
likewise a coincidence.


""A Child is Coming""
Jefferson Starship, BLOWS AGAINST THE EMPIRE

Rumor: When played backward, ""son of Satan.""
Findings: Another phonetic coincidence. The repeated ""It's getting
better"" reverses to an iffy ""son of Satan,"" the ""of"" drawn out and
the ""Satan"" strongly accented on the first syllable.


""Eldorado""
Electric Light Orchestra, ELDORADO

Rumor: When played backward, ""He is the nasty one/ Christ, you're
infernal/ It is said we're dead men/ Everyone who has the mark
will live.""
Findings: Coincidence. The supposed message lurks around the line
""On a voyage of no return to see."" Reversed, this passage becomes
the expected syllable salad -- no one hearing it would describe it
as anything but reversed music. Only if you listen while reading
along with what you're supposed to hear will you get anything. The
rumored version of the message is somewhat fudged. The passage
sounds more like ""He's to nasty one/ Christ you are, Christ,
you're fernal/ There wiss uh, we're dead men..."" There is no ""in""
in what is taken to be ""infernal."" The line that is supposed to be
""Everyone who has the mark will live"" isn't even close, though the
syllable count is right.


""Shoo Be Doo""
The Cars, CANDY-O

Rumor: When played backward, the word ""Satan"" repeated
approximately eleven times.
Findings: Coincidence. The rumor refers to the reversal of the ""Shoo
be doo, shoo be doo, shoo be doo..."" near the end of the song. Given
the mysterious logic of reversed phonemes, these three-syllable units
can be hard as a repeated two-syllable word. The word sounds a little
like ""Satan.""


""Snowblind""
Styx, PARADISE THEATER

Rumor: According to a mimeographed list of suspect records distributed
by Congressman Dornan, the words ""Satan move through our voices"" when
played backwards.
Findings: Negative. Despite repeated listenings, it was not even
possible to identify the part of the reversed track that Dornan et al.
are talking about.


""Stairway to Heaven""
Led Zeppelin, untitled, a.k.a. STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN

Rumor: In reverse, ""I live for Satan... The Lord turns me off...
There's no escaping it... Here's to my sweet Satan... There's power in
Satan... He will give you 666.""
Findings: Coincidence. If you listen very carefully to the ""And it
makes me wonder"" lines in reverse, you'll hear something approaching
""There's no escaping it."" A better description is ""There's no escape
do."" Knock of the last syllable, and you have ""There's no escape,"" a
complete, intelligible sentence in reverse. It's there, all right, but
it's not an unlikely enough coincidence to -- well, make you wonder.
      The ""Satan"" in ""I live for Satan"" is good and clear. The ""I live
for"" part isn't. The other alleged lines are unremarkable. All are
phonetic reversals of the entirely lucid forward lyrics and obviously
just accidents.


""When Electricity Came to Arkansas""
Black Oak Arkansas, BLACK OAK ARKANSAS and RONCH AND ROLL

Rumor: In reverse, ""Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan. He is God. He
is God.""
Findings: The BLACK OAK ARKANSAS cut was reversed. Again, pairs of
reversed syllables are being freely interpreted as ""Satan."" ""He is
God"" was not identifiable.


""Rain""
The Beatles, HEY JUDE

Rumor: Unintelligible lyrics at the end are reversed.
Findings: A true engineered reversal and not really a secret. ""Rain""
seems to have been the first popular recording to incorporate an
obviously reversed lyric. The story is that John Lennon accidentally
spliced the last part of the song in backward and liked the effect.
When reversed, the strange-sounding vocals at the end become
intelligible as a reprise starting with the drawn-out word
""sunshine.""
      The reversal is less apparent to the casual listener than it
might be because the accompanying music is not reversed. The ending
fits in smoothly with the rest of the song, the vocals suggesting a
foreign language.


""Fire on High""
Electric Light Orchestra, FACE THE MUSIC

Rumor: When played backward, ""The music is reversible, but time --
turn back!""
Findings: ""Fire on High"" is instrumental. About twenty-six seconds
into the music, scrambled speech is heard. It is mostly louder than
the accompanying music and begins with a two-syllable unit repeated
several times. The seeming speech lasts for about fourteen seconds.
      Reversing the music confirms that there is a true, engineered
message. In reverse, a voice (Jeff Lynne's?) says, ""The music is
reversible, but time -- turn back! Turn back! Turn back! Turn back!""
All the words are clear and unambiguous. Anyone comparing this to the
alleged reversal on ELO's ""Eldorado"" will have no trouble telling
which is genuine.


""Goodbye Blue Sky""
Pink Floyd, THE WALL

Rumor: In reverse, ""You have discovered the secret message.""
Findings: The ""secret message"" is at the very end of the instrumental
passage following the ""Goodbye Blue Sky"" vocals. It comes just before
the words ""What shall we do"" at the start of the song that is
identified as ""Empty Spaces"" on the record label and as ""What shall we
do now?"" on the record sleeve. Played forward, the message is less
apparent than the FACE THE MUSIC reversal: A reasonably attentive
listener might play THE WALL through and not catch it. It suggests
speech not quite close enough to be overheard. In context this is not
unusual because the ""Goodbye Blue Sky"" instrumental passage includes
""airport noises"" and other sound effects. A loud climax in the music
further masks the unintelligible voice.
      When played backward, the voice (Roger Waters?) plainly intones,
""Congratulations, you have just discovered the secret message. Please
send your answer to old Pink, care of the funny farm..."" As the voice
fades out, there may be another word -- perhaps ""Chalfonte or
""Chelsea"" -- after ""funny farm.""


""Heavy Metal Poisoning""
Styx, KILROY WAS HERE

Rumor: A red sticker on the KILROY WAS HERE cover warns, ""By order of
the Majority for Musical Morality, this album contains secret backward
messages...""
Findings: This is a case of second-generation backward-masking. Styx'
PARADISE THEATER did not contain a backward message, though a lot of
people said it did. So Styx has included a sure enough backward
message on KILROY WAS HERE. It is at the very beginning of ""Heavy
Metal Poisoning."" The reversed speech last about three seconds. There
is no musical background. The words reverse to ""Annuit coeptis. Novus
ordo seclorum."" This is the Latin motto encircling the pyramid on the
back of a dollar bill. The usual translation: ""God has favored our
undertakings. A new order of the ages.""
      The cover sticker's ""Majority for Musical Morality"" is a
fictitious Falwellesque group in the KILROY WAS HERE video. Although
the sticker suggests a plurality of ""messages,"" only one was found.


Space between ""I'm So Tired"" and ""Blackbird""
The Beatles, untitled, a.k.a. THE WHITE ALBUM

Rumor: A reversed message. At the time of the Paul-is-dead stories,
the segue from ""I'm So Tired"" to ""Blackbird"" was offered as evidence.
It was held to contain John Lennon's voice, reveresed, saying ""Paul is
dead, miss him, miss him, miss him."" That interpretation seems
unlikely now, but there is a mysterious low muttering between the
songs.
Findings: The mumbling is actually just to the ""I'm So Tired"" side of
the shiny ""space"" between cuts on the record. Each of the stereo
tracks was recorded separately, twice, and a copy of each track was
reversed. This produced four versions of the two-second passage: right
forward, left forward, right reversed, and left reversed. All were
equally unintelligible. It was not even apparent whether the voice is
forward or reversed. Nor could John Lennon be identified as the
speaker. There are nine or ten syllables. The first six (when played
forward) are a two-syllable unit repeated three times. There is little
or no difference betwen the stereo tracks. Any claimed interpretation
of the sounds seems doubtful.


""Strawberry Fields Forever""
The Beatles, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR

Rumor: It was, of course, claimed that John Lennon says ""I buried
Paul"" at the end. (It's forward, at the very end after the music
fades to complete silence, returns, and starts to fade out again.)
But Lennon told ROLLING STONE that the words are ""cranberry
sauce.""
Findings: They are ""cranberry sauce."" The ""sauce""/""Paul"" part is
indistinct, but the first syllable sounds a lot more like ""cran""
than ""I.""


""Baby You're a Rich Man""
The Beatles, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR

Rumor: On one of the tracks the line ""Baby you're a rich man too""
is sung as ""Baby you're a rich fag Jew,"" a dig at Brian Epstein.
Or some think it's ""rich fat Jew"" and claim it as evidence of
Beatle anti-Semitism.
Findings: Negative. The two stereo tracks are nearly identical.
It's always possible to hear words as similar-sounding words, but
basically, the lyrics jibe with the published version.


""Revolution 9""
The Beatles, untitled, a.k.a. THE WHITE ALBUM

Rumor: Various reversed and/or one-track speech. The reversal of
""Number nine"" to ""Turn me on, dead man"" has pretty much been
discounted as coincidence (though it appears on Congressman
Dornan's list).
Findings: Distinction between lyrics and any hidden message blurs
on ""Revolution 9."" The eight-minute cut is a montage of sounds
collected by John Lennon and Yoko Ono. It includes discordant
music, radio broadcasts, sirens, applause, gunfights, sports
cheers, the crackling of a fire, screams, a baby gurgling, a choir
singing, and much that cannot be identified. For this
investigation, ""Revolution 9"" was transcribed four times, twice on
each stereo channel. One copy of each of the tracks was reversed.
The four resulting versions were compared with each other and
against the original two-channel version.
     ""Revolution 9"" contains a lot of talking. Played in stereo,
forward, the longest stretch of understandable speech is probably
an announcer saying, ""...every one of them knew that as time went
by they'd get a little bit older and a little bit slower...""
     One believable instance of reversed speech occurs: someone
saying ""Let me out! Let me out!"" (once held to represent McCartney
in his totaled Aston-Martin). Two iffy reversals occur on the
backward recording of the right stereo track:""She used to be
assistant"" and ""There were two men..."" Neither is clear enough or
long enough to be convincing. Some of the music, including the
recurring theme, sounds more natural in reverse.
     ""Turn me on, dead man"" is a typical phonetic reversal. The
forward ""number nine"" (repeated throughout the cut) is clear; the
reversal is slurred -- something like ""turn me on dedmun."" It has
been claimed that ""number nine"" must be pronounced with a British
accent or with some careful inflection in order to reverse to
""Turn me on, dead man."" This seems not to be so. As an experiment,
three American-accent renderings of ""number nine"" were reversed.
All sound about as much like ""Turn me on, dead man"" as the record
did. Like the other phonetic reversals, ""Turn me on, dead man""
must be considered a coincidence.
     Much of ""Revolution 9"" is on one stereo track only. Near the
end a voice says ""A fine natural imbalance...the Watusi...the
twist...Eldorado...Eldorado."" ""A fine natural imbalance"" is on the
right track only, though the words that follow are in stereo. One
of the longer bits of speech -- ""Who could tell what he was
saying? His voice was low and his [unintelligible] was high and
his eyes were low"" -- is clear on the left track, a bare whisper
on the right.
     There is a stereophonically concealed ""secret message"" on
""Revolution 9."" The words are on the right track. They begin about
four minutes, fifty-eight seconds into the cut and run for about
twenty-two seconds. They are not likely to be noticed in stereo
because of the much louder left track. The sound of applause
begins on the left track at about five minutes, one second into
the cut. Deafening noises -- the clapping, sirens, music --
continue on the left track until five minutes, forty seconds. It
may or may not have been Lennon's and Ono's intention to conceal
the spoken passage. Given the haphazard quality of ""Revolution 9,""
the concealment may have been accidental. To recover the passage,
the left track must be switched off. The right track can then be
heard to contain a sound like a stopwatch ticking, behind these
words:

     So the wife called, and we better go to see a
     surgeon....[A SCREAM MUFFLES A LINE THAT SOUNDS LIKE
     Well, what with the prices, the prices have snowballed,
     no wonder it's closed.] ...So any and all, we went to
     see the dentist instead, who gave him a pair of teeth,
     which wasn't any good at all. So instead of that he
     joined the bloody navy and went to sea.
                      by William Poundstone
                              1986

     There really are backward messages on rock albums. And the
controversy over ""backward masking"" and ""porn rock"" has inspired a
whole new spate of messages. There may have been more genuine
backward messages in the past few years than ever before.
     The backward message controversy is usually traced to the
1960s and John Lennon's avant-garde sound mixing on such tracks as
""Revolution 9"" on the Beatles' WHITE ALBUM. Lennon probably wasn't
trying to conceal a message so much as create an interesting
sound.
     The matter might have ended right there had it not been for
the Paul McCartney death rumor. College kids tried playing Beatles
records forward, backward, and at various speeds to find ""clues""
to McCartney's fate. In the process they found snippets of speech
from Lennon's experiments. Even after McCartney was found safe and
sound in Scotland, some listeners continued to look for hidden
messages.
     Somehow, fundamentalist Christian groups became convinced
(ca. 1982) that the alleged messages were commercials for devil
worship. Not a single indisputable satanic message has turned up,
but there were scattered attempts to ban or label certain albums.
In 1986 one fundamentalist group announced that the theme song for
the old MR. ED TV show contains the word ""Satan"" when played
backward.)
     Ironically, the publicity accorded nonexistent messages has
inspired several artists -- among them porn rock hearing witness
Frank Zappa -- to hide real background messages in their music.
It's easy to do.
     The performer speaks or sings the message normally, then
reverses the tape, which is mixed into the soundtrack. This is all
accomplished simply enough at any recording studio.
     What's not so simple is playing it back. More home record,
cassette, and compact disk players won't play backward. You can
turn a record backward with a pencil eraser, but it's not good for
the needle or the turntable. The only way to reproduce the message
with full fidelity is to use a professional-quality reel-to-reel
tape player and splice the tape in backward.
     We used the facilities of KLOS radio in Los Angeles to
reverse some recent records containing true backward messages.


""Secret Messages""
Electric Light Orchestra, SECRET MESSAGES

ELO's ELDORADO album was among those alleged to contain satanic
backward masked messages. A patient listening to ELDORADO played
backward reveals no such messages. You hear only what you ought to
hear -- the reversed lyrics of the songs, which sound nothing like
the ""messages"" claimed to be there. In the wake of such
allegations, ELO did put an (innocuous) backward message on their
FACE THE MUSIC album. Perhaps they thought this would show how
silly the allegations were. Instead, the backward-masking people
seized on this as proof that the other ""messages"" were real. In
the latest volley, ELO has named an album after the controversy.
     In Britain (where the backward-masking issue is viewed as an
American eccentricity), the cover of SECRET MESSAGES has a mock
warning label to youth about the hidden label. Word of the albums'
impending release in the United States caused enough of a furor to
chill CBS Records into deleting the cover blurb.
     The reversed message is easy to find. It's at the beginning
of the first song, which is itself called ""Secret Messages."" You
can hear reversed speech when you play the record normally. A
voice intones ""secret messages"" -- forward -- in the middle of the
reversed speech, lest anyone dare be so unhip as to not know
what's going on.
     We transferred a new copy of SECRET MESSAGES to reel-to-reel
tapes and played it backward. The backward message goes: ""WELCOME
TO THE BIG SHOW/ WELCOME TO THE BIG SHOW.""
     That's it.


""Ya Hozna""
Frank Zappa, THEM OR US

""Ya Hozna,"" a six-minute composition on the first record of the
THEM OR US double album, is ENTIRELY backward. The albums' inner
cover, which includes lyrics for the other songs, says, ""backwards
vocal -- you figure it out"" of this cut. It credits Frank and Moon
Zappa, George Duke, and Napoleon Murphy Brock as vocalists.
     Played forward, ""Ya Howza"" sounds like a record played
backward -- reasonably so. The vocals are prominent and
unintelligible. Moon Zappa's voice is curiously recognizable, even
in reverse. It is hard to tell whether the music was recorded
forward or backward.
     When ""Ya Howza"" is played in reverse, you discover that the
music is virtually a palindrome -- it sounds about the same
forward and backward. The voices are all backward. In some cases
they have been modified electronically. Many of the words are
muffled. Even after repeated careful listening on both stereo
tracks, it is difficult to make out many of the lyrics. It doesn't
help that some of the words seem to be stream-of-consciousness
nonsense. Some of the unintelligible stuff sounds like opera.
     Starting at the beginning of the reversed tape -- the end of
the forward tape -- the clearer vocals go like this: ""I am the
heaven, I am the water."" This is in a hymnlike register. ""You are
a lonely little girl./ But your mommy and your daddy hold you."" A
singsong synthesizer voice.
     The most interesting part of the lyrics is an intermittently
orgasmic rap in Moon Zappa's Valley Girl voice. There are three
short monologues:

I'm like green!
I'm like squat!
I'm like soul!
Repeat, like soul!
I'm like pull, push,
Okay, like slow, slow.

You're never too old
Like slow, like slow, like slow
Okay, I like it.


All right, faster, faster,
Go, do it, do it twice,
Yeah, that feels good,
I'm looking great,
Yeah, fer shure!
Like, no way!


""No Anchovies, Please""
J. Geils Band, LOVE STINKS

""No Anchovies, Please"" is a novelty song, really a narration with
sound effects, about a woman who is kidnapped after eating
anchovies. She is taken to a ""foreign-speaking"" country. The sound
effect of the foreign tongue seems reversed. When you do play it
in reverse, it becomes: ""It doesn't take a genius to know the
difference between chicken shit and chicken salad.""


""Darling Nikki""
Prince, PURPLE RAIN

""Darling Nikki,"" cited as porn rock before Congress, is about a
dominatrix in a hotel lobby masturbating with a magazine. In part,
the complaint was that the album cover (flowers, and Prince on a
motorcycle) wasn't explicit enough to warn kids of the suggestive
lyrics. Senator Paula Hawkins apparently was not aware of a
backward message hidden in ""Darling Nikki."" The last thirty-five
seconds of the song is gibberish. The music changes abruptly and
becomes a repeated glottal sound. Then a two-syllable sound is
repeated twice, something like ""heaven, heaven."" Unintelligible
speech follows. At the end is a sound reminiscent of rain or bacon
frying , and wind sounds.
     Played backward, the message becomes:

     Hello, how are you?
     I'm fine 'cause I know that the Lord is coming soon.
     Coming, coming soon.

     It is clearly Prince and the Revolution singing this. The
words are clear but the intonation is funny -- the linger on some
words. Perhaps this is to make the reversed message you hear
playing the record normally a little less conspicuous.
     This is a weird reversal of the supposed secret message
menace. Raunchy forward lyrics conceal a religious secret message.


""Judas Kiss""
Petra, MORE POWER TO YOU

Petra is an obscure group that sings religious songs to a rock
beat. As further proof that things have gone full circle, the
backward-masking controversy prompted Petra to include a wholesome
backward message on their MORE POWER TO YOU album. It is in the
transition between two songs, just before ""Judas Kiss."" Clearly
audible gibberish reverses to this (the husky voice a cross
between George Beverly Shea and Dee Snider): ""What are you looking
for the Devil for, when you ought to be looking for the Lord?""

AFL JoyceM Welcome to the Apple II Music & Sound chat - our discussion will
           be on NoiseTracker - the new FTA music program for the GS.  AFA
           Gene will be our host this evening...Gene, the floor is yours :)

AFA Gene   Hi all... well first I'd like to point out, if y'all aren't aware
           yet, that a spanking new version of NoiseTracker has recently
           been released (9 days ago) and is now available in our New Files
           library. It is version 0.5. I haven't played around with it much
           yet, but it's supposed to fix a lot of the little bugs in 0.3
           (the first version we had online).  NoiseTracker also includes
           the ability to directly import ""modules,"" a term used for a
           certain type of Amiga song file which has become popular among PC
           users using the SoundBlaster sound card.

           Now, via NT, these ""MOD"" files are accessible by the GS. We
           expect to see a lot of activity on this end as far as ports from
           the PC and Amiga go. Note that you should be able to go straight
           to the PC music forum and download any recently uploaded MOD
           songfiles (there was a bug in the first wide release of the PCAO
           software, however, so a bunch of files with dates between around
           March 1991 and September 1991 may not download properly. Note that
           to use these PC MOD files, you'll have to rename the downloaded
           file ""MOD.xxxxxx"" if you want it to show up automatically in NT's
           ""open"" dialog box. (On the PC, all MOD files are named
           ""xxxxxxxx.MOD"" instead.)   Also, if the files are packed with ZIP
           compression, you'll need a program from the Communications Forum
           called AGATE -- it's a terminal program that includes the ability
           to unpack ZIP files.

           Now, I guess the best thing to do would be to talk about our
           favorite songfiles... there have been a few complaints, in fact,
           that people were not being ""descriptive"" enough in their file
           descriptions for uploads in describing the songs.

AFC Eddie  ?

AFA Gene   GA ed

AFC Eddie  Once a MOD file is unpacked with Agate, is a file type change
           needed?

AFA Gene   Nope, since all that NT looks for is the ""MOD."" being the first
           four characters in the filename.

AFC Eddie  OK, Thanks!

Deanna7332 Question...

JonL7      Can you list some of the features of Noisetracker?

AFA Gene   (you don't even need that ""MOD."" if you want to type the name in
           directly.)

Deanna7332 Did any of these mod files have anything to do with FTA's ""Module
           A""

AFA Gene   Sure Jon, right after we answer Deanna's question. Deanna, you
           mean ""Modulae?""

Deanna7332 Yes, that's it.

AFA Gene   Modulae was a demo written by FTA last year. (i'll get to you in a
           sec Doors).  It used SoundSmith v0.95 for all it's music. There
           is no connection between MOD files and Modulae by FTA.

Deanna7332 Throughout the demo it said ""Loading modules""

AFA Gene   Those ""modules"" are not the same as Amiga soundfile ""modules"" --
           you see, what Modulae really was was a ""stringing together"" of a
           bunch of neat little tiny demos that FTA had written. So they
           called each little demo a ""module"" and thus the entire demo as a
           whole, ""Modulae"" (fancy plural of module?)

Deanna7332 Ok I understand.  Thank you. :)

AFL JoyceM Latin, Gene :)

AFA Gene   The term ""MODule"" from the Amiga comes from the idea that all the
           stuff needed to play the songfile (all the instruments + the
           sequence file) are included into one file, the ""module.""

TheDoors1  Gene, I have tried to d/l some recent uploaded MODs in the PC
           music area and still the problem exists.

AFA Gene   As I understand it, the problem was fixed VERY recently (correct
           me on this Joyce) and files uploaded as recently as early
           November still might not work depending on the version of the
           PCAO software that the uploader used.

AFL JoyceM Actually, Gene...I was under the impression that it had been, but
           if Doors is still having a problem, then it must not be fixed.

AFA Gene   What date was the file you tried to d/l, Door?

TheDoors1  umm 11/17, around there

AFA Gene   hmmm.... well i can tell you one thing... if it didn't work, don't
           waste your time again later... the problem is in the Apple
           software's method of d/lling files, and there are no plans to
           upgrade the Apple AO software.

AFL JoyceM I will endeavor to get an answer to that PC downloading
           problem/question :)

ThomasK63  i have a quick question... what can you use to unpack amiga mod
           files? On the PC side, that is.

TheDoors1  Agate Thomas

ELECTMUSIC Doors... what happens on after downloading..

Deanna7332 If it's LZHed you can't unless you have an IBM or
           PC/Transporter.

AFA Gene   If GS-ShrinkIt doesn't have that ability, i don't think there
           exists any such utility on the GS.

TheDoors1  What do you mean Elect?

ELECTMUSIC After you download the file... where do you encounter a problem?

TheDoors1  ok, you know when you download the file and at some point in the
           download the file starts to appear on your screen.  That's when I
           cancel it.

ThomasK63  I am sure soething good can be made w/out resorting to Amiga
           files

AFC Eddie  Yes, Doors, I believe the problem is with the PC software it was
           UL'd with.

TheDoors1  yeah Eddie.

GNO Tim    Amiga MOD files are typically compressed using LHarc.  I've
           uncompressed several on my Unix machine at school.

ThomasK63  good time for someone to make a lharc unpacker...

AFC DYAJim someone might be ;)

GNO Tim    Several people are already

AFC Eddie  Can't wait, Jim!

AFA Gene   Jon, did you have a question?

JonL7      The features of Noisetracker :)

AFA Gene   Oh yes... okay, here goes, in a nutshell, from most important to
           least:


AFA Gene   *  ability to import MOD files

           *  ability to import Soundsmith files

           *  ProDOS 8 based

           *  virtually no editing abilities (not a feature but important to
           know)

AFC DYAJim :)

AFA Gene   *  forgot: and the most important feature of all, the ability to
           hold instrument files in regular system RAM instead of DOC RAM,
           allowing for instruments far beyond the regular 64K limit found
           in ALL other GS music programs.

ThomasK63  I'll buy that!

TheDoors1  I have another question...when you're ready.

AFA Gene   GA Doors

TheDoors1  ok..is it true that NoiseTracker will take in soundsmith files and
           play them more clearly

AFA Gene   Well, as far as ""what you hear,"" yes there is a definite
           difference with some instruments. It does NOT play the sounds
           more ""clearly,"" but it just plays them in a different way. What
           many people seem to like about this ""different way"" is that
           sustained instruments (i.e. instruments designed to be played
           in a loop to simulate a long held note) seem to work better (or
           perhaps simply the way they were originally intended to work).

TheDoors1  I see

Deanna7332 Which takes up more space - MOD or NT  w/soundfile ?

AFA Gene   Deanna, it depends a few things, such as how big the sequence is,
           how many instruments you have, etc. Once you have a lot of
           assorted files, it'll probably average out to be about the same
           give or take a hundred blocks on your HD. So it basically depends
           on whether you prefer to have your instruments separate or not.

Deanna7332 Does playing quality differ with either one ?

AFA Gene   Nope. It's exactly the same either way. Loading time is the same
           too.

AFC Eddie  Can NT save songs as MOD files?

AFA Gene   Nope. It has options for Open and Close module, but these are
           still inactive.

AFA Gene   If there are no more questions, I'd like to talk about which NT
           files out there are the ""hottest,"" since this info could be
           useful to many users who are interested in downloading NT/MOD
           files.

           My personal favorite is ""Lambada,"" which is supplied by FTA with
           the program but is available separately on America
           Online.Everything about this file is really impressive except
           perhaps the sound quality of the horn-ish melody instrument.

           What about y'all, what are your favorite NT files?

AFL JoyceM Gene, there is a classical song for NT, but can't remember the
           name, but it is good.

AFC Eddie  I like Dragnet!

ELECTMUSIC So do I Ed

TheDoors1  I like Seven something

Deanna7332 My most favorite of all mod files is Pleasure Principle

AFC Eddie  <--appreciate's Greg's taste!

AFL JoyceM :)

AFA Gene   Deanna, i assume you got that from a local board?

Deanna7332 I got it from the PC forum here.

TheDoors1  I saw it there also

Deanna7332 I think under ""Pleasure""

AFA Gene   Would you be able to upload it here? If it's really that good, we
           ought to have it available directly in our oun NT lib here (BTW
           folks, we will be releasing a new NoiseTracker software library
           soon!)

AFC Eddie  What a Forum!!!

Deanna7332 That sounds great!

AFL JoyceM Gene, do you think it will be possible for synthLAB files to be
           converted to MOD files?

AFL JoyceM MOD files?

AFA Gene   I doubt it, Joyce. The formats are so diametrically opposed in
           their entire basis of their file formats that it wouldn't be
           worth the time for a programmer to develop such a convertor.

Deanna7332 Isn't it possible to move the mod file from the PC forum to our
           music library?

AFA Gene   But..... it might be worth the time for a MIDI File Format to MOD
           convertor, since these two formats are more widely accepted.

Nuzz       they have nothing better to do Gene

ELECTMUSIC Gene.. some interesting similarities with DTune and NTracker

AFA Gene   They lose the file, tho, Deanna. :)

AFL JoyceM In what way, Greg?

ELECTMUSIC Both Prodos 8

Deanna7332 Shhh they won't know a thing :)

ELECTMUSIC I also believe Bill uses a shuttling of sound data between Doc
           Ram and Ram.

AFC Eddie  Interesting, Greg.

ELECTMUSIC Thats how he gets some of the excellent instrument quality

AFC Eddie  But Diversitune has that one distinction:  MIDI input.

AFL JoyceM Deanna, we would greatly appreciate it if you would upload that
           'Pleasure' song to our library :)

ELECTMUSIC Agreed Ed.. one of the factors FTA doesn't like to incorporate
           into their programs.

Deanna7332 I'll u/l it tonight if possible.

AFL JoyceM Thanks :)

AFC Eddie  Thanks, Deanna!

AFL JoyceM I will send Bill B a copy of NoiseTracker + some MOD files...to
           see what comments we get from him (will send when I get back).

AFC DYAJim What ever happened to that diversitune upgrade that was talked
           about ?

ELECTMUSIC That would be interesting Joyce

AFC Eddie  Bill apparently still working on it, Jim.

ELECTMUSIC I am sure he would appreciate the Prodos 8

AFC DYAJim good..

AFL JoyceM Jim...RSN....he was hoping by Christmas (this year), but he is
           soooo busy with his job, who knows?

AFC DYAJim Oh yeah, I noticed the speed calcuation in NT .5 is inaccurate
           :)

AFC DYAJim I recall he has set a lot of Christmas projected dates :)

ELECTMUSIC He was one of the first ""Free Tools"" experts in breaking all the
           rules for economic sake.

AFC DYAJim like for the vaporware DT inst editor like 2 years ago.

Deanna7332 Are there any Christmas Mod or NT songs?

AFC Eddie  Oh yeah, Diversi-Editor!

AFL JoyceM I know, Jim - but that I know he has been working on.

AFC DYAJim he projected Christmas for it, and it never came :)

AFA Gene   Not yet in AMS, but hopefully the Holiday Contest will change all
           that. :)

AFC DYAJim I look foreward to any upgrades..

AFL JoyceM Not that I am aware of Deanna - you have some?  hint, hint

Deanna7332 Nope sorry.  I was hoping there were some that could be u/led
           here

AFC DYAJim I'll be breaking out the xmas tune book rsn.. I should be able to
           midi a few :) (which rules out nt)

AFL JoyceM Question...

AFC Eddie  It would be more appropriate to have a converter from Appleworks
           spreadsheet to MOD than from MIDI!

AFL JoyceM If I got ahold of an Amiga song (MOD) disk...how would I convert
           them for here?

AFA Gene   You mean an Amiga-formatted disk?

AFL JoyceM Yes

AFC DYAJim Ack.. methinks you need an amiga and a null modem cable or a
           modem.

AFA Gene   Methinks Jim is right

AFC DYAJim LOL!!  Design your music in the spreadsheet then import to NT :)
           IT might actually have better editing?!! :)

AFC Eddie  Right!

AFL JoyceM Me thinks he is right.  If I had them upload to me, would that
           work?

AFA Gene   Yep; should work like a charm.

AFC DYAJim Yah.. as long as they're coming from an amiga

AFL JoyceM Great....I will work on that when I get back  (making note now).

AFL JoyceM Gene, will you get some of those files (NT) sent to that area
           tonight?  If so, I will leave the needed message :)

AFA Gene   That's all I have planned for tonight's chat, Joyce. Yep, I'll
           move some files right now.

AFL JoyceM Thanks...

AFL JoyceM Then we should have our NoiseTracker Library by end of the week in
           AMS :)

ELECTMUSIC Gene... quick question:  Are you launching NTracker from a 3.5
           disk?

AFL JoyceM Okay, guys...I will see you all the week of December 11th (may the
           4th) as I am off on vacation.

AFA Gene   Yep greg

AFC JohnC  Where are you going?

ELECTMUSIC Do you encounter out of memory problems

AFL JoyceM Night all...and Gene, thanks for an excellent chat and great
           explanations of NoiseTracker.

Nuzz       Joyce, I have good news for FutureSound owners. SoundConvert will
           support it in the first release

AFC Eddie  Great, Mike!

AFA Gene   Greg, i always keep my RAMdisk at 0 when using noisetracker. Not
           only are

AFC JohnC  Mike...SoundConvert...released?

AFL JoyceM Great, Mike.  When can we get SoundConvert, Mike? and FutureSound
           :)

AFA Gene   there a couple of bugs with memory management, but if you're
           loading in a MOD file that's really big, NT will eat your RAMdisk.

AFC Eddie  Sounds good.

Nuzz       The manual is being ""layout"". Release date should be about 1st
           week of Dec

ELECTMUSIC Tnxs Gene

AFC JohnC  YES.......WTG Nuzz!!!!!!!!

Deanna7332 Yes, why is there on some MOD files a stop somewhere in the middle
           ?

Deanna7332 That's really frustrating!

AFL JoyceM Mike, leave me E-Mail on when and how I can send your the $$ to
           get it.

AFL JoyceM Again...night all

Nuzz       gee John, I had to do something to explain the delay :)

ELECTMUSIC Thanks Gene for a GREAT chat!

AFC Eddie  Yes, Gene!  Great!

AFA Gene   Thanks Greg, 'night!

AFA Gene   thanx, see y'all later :)

Copyright 1987 Bob Szekely.

    John Michael Osbourne, (known as ""Ozzy"" to his fans), has in his long 
career as vocalist for Black Sabbath had his work with the group misconstrued 
as advocating Satanism.  In a 1983 radio special featuring Ozzy, the 
interviewer expressed precisely this point; ""...Ozzy has always been shrouded 
in the darkest of Satanic imagery.  Yet if you really listen to his music, 
you'll find that what he is saying differs greatly from his image....""(1)  Even 
the group's image has often been described as ""occult and diabolic"".(2)

    The important point to remember here is to differentiate between appearance 
and reality.  Although the name ""Black Sabbath"" conjures up images of witches 
and sorcerers paying homage to Satan for the powers bestowed upon them, this 
does not make it safe to assume that the group that went by this name 
necessarily drew the inspiration from the occult.(3)  The closest they ever 
came to it was a gothic horror film featuring Boris Karloff as narrator; they 
adopted their name directly from the name of this film.(4)  Black Sabbath was 
involved in the black arts as much as Karloff practiced casting spells off-
screen.  Tony Iommi, the group's guitarist, summed it up best when he described 
the group as having basically ""...the same appeal as a horror movie.  It's all 
an act.""(5)










    Just as their film counterpart did, Ozzy and Sabbath found the occult 
mythos to be an effective vehicle for powerful social commentary; particularly 
when put in the context of heavy-metal rock and roll.  Ozzy himself noted that 
there are ""...people who pick up my [album] cover[s] and go...'This guy's got 
to be singing about Devil, doom, death and destruction.'  Which is not the 
case....""(6)

    The late Lester Bangs likened the group to Bob Dylan and William Burroughs, 
describing them all as ""...moralists...trying to deal with a serious present 
situation in an honest way....""(7)  Ozzy and Black Sabbath merely bring to 
light the many evils of our world in their work, to try and make us realize 
that we are all victim to their influence.  They hope to make us recognize 
these evils so that we may take up arms against them; a point Ozzy emphatically 
stresses:  ""...one thing everybody has got to understand about Black Sabbath's 
lyrics.  They're not downer lyrics, they're just telling everybody where it's 
at...""(8)  He also cites the group's most controversial tune, ""Black Sabbath"", 
as a response to the ignorant hippie culture still force when the tune was 
written in 1970:  ""The hippies said: 'The world is beautiful man.' (sic)  You 
only had to look around you to see how crappy it was.  It was ridiculous 
listening to that stuff, let alone playing it, so we just wrote about the world 
the way it really was and how it affected us - and we felt better in ourselves 
because we were really being honest....""(9)

    I   1   HAVE YOU EVER THOUGH ABOUT YOUR SOUL-
        2   CAN IT BE SAVED?
        3   OR PERHAPS YOU THINK THAT WHEN YOU ARE DEAD
        4   YOU JUST STAY IN YOUR GRAVE.
        5   IS GOD JUST A THOUGHT WITHIN YOUR HEAD OR IS
        6   HE A PART OF YOU?
        7   IS CHRIST JUST A NAME THAT YOU READ IN A BOOK
        8   WHEN YOU WERE AT SCHOOL?

    II  9   WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT DEATH DO YOU LOSE
        10  YOUR BREATH OR DO YOU KEEP YOUR COOL?
        11  WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE THE POPE ON THE END
        12  OF A ROPE - DO YOU THINK HE'S A FOOL?
        13  WELL I'VE SEEN THE TRUTH - YES I'VE SEEN 
        14  THE LIGHT AND I'VE CHANGED MY WAYS.
        15  AND I'LL BE PREPARED WHEN YOU'RE LONELY 
        16  AND SCARED AT THE END OF OUR DAYS.

    III 17  COULD IT BE YOU'RE AFRAID OF WHAT YOU'R
        18  FRIENDS MIGHT SAY 
        19  IF THEY NEW YOU BELIEVED IN GOD ABOVE
        20  THEY SHOULD REALISE BEFORE THE CRITICISE
        21  THAT GOD IS THE ONLY WAY TO LOVE.

    IV  23  IS YOUR MIND SO SMALL THAT YOU HAVE TO FALL
        24 IN WITH THE PACK WHEREVER THEY RUN
        25  WILL YOU STILL SNEER WHEN DEATH IS NEAR
        26  AND SAY THEY MAY AS WELL WORSHIP THE SUN.

    V   27  I THINK IT WAS TRUE IT WAS PEOPLE LIKE YOU
        28  THAT CRUCIFIED CHRIST
        29  I THINK IT IS SAD THE OPINION YOU HADE WAS THE
        30  ONLY ONE VOICED.
        31  WILL YOU BE SO SURE WHEN YOUR DAY IS NEAR
        32  SAY YOU DON'T BELIEVE?
        33  YOU HAD THE CHANCE BUT YOU TURNED IT DOWN
        34  NOW YOU CAN'T RETRIEVE.










    VI  35  PERHAPS YOU'LL THINK BEFORE YOU SAY THAT
        36  GOD IS DEAD AND GONE
        37  OPEN YOUR EYES, JUST REALIZE THAT HE IS THE
        38  ONE.
        39  THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN SAVE YOU KNOW FROM
        40  ALL THIS SIN AND HATE.
        41  OR WILL YOU STILL JEER AT ALL YOU HEAR?
        42  YES!-I THINK IT'S TOO LATE.

    In this piece, the group asserts a belief in an afterlife and spiritual 
redemption.  As grisly as the image of a hanged pontiff is, its shock value is 
a necessary part of the message:  They reject religious dogma, stating that a 
belief in God, in one's own heart, is the only guiding light to help one inn 
his life (lines 11/12, 39/40).  Furthermore, the reject religious hypocrisy 
(lines 5/6, 7/8) and peer pressure (verses III, IV) as excuses for not 
accepting God.  To clarify further:  following the crowd does not justify 
shrugging responsibility for one's own actions.

    After re-reading, it becomes obvious that this song is an ascerbic critique 
of atheism; (line 35/36) I refer here again to verses three and four.  In these 
two verses, the picture painted in one of Godless conformity and how it's 
viewed as being as foolish as Paganism.  These lyrics set an example for the 
listener by relating personal experience (lines 13-16).  However, for those who 
cannot accept this the group has no recourse but to condemn them, although 
rather ironically; they hope that their rhetorical loss of faith in the 
listener will open his eyes (line 42).










                           B L A C K   S A B B A T H 



            WHAT IS THIS, THAT STANDS BEFORE ME?
            FIGURE IN BLACK, WHICH POINTS AT ME
            TURN ROUND QUICK AND START TO RUN
            FIND OUT I'M THE CHOSEN ONE.  OH, NO!
            
            BIG BLACK SHAPE WITH EYES OF FIRE
            TELLING PEOPLE THEIR DESIRE
            SATAN'S SITTING THERE, HE'S SMILING
            WATCHES THOSE FLAMES GET HIGHER AND HIGHER
            OH, NO, NO, -- PLEASE GOD HELP ME!
            
                IS THIS THE END MY FRIEND?
                SATAN'S COMING 'ROUND THE BEND
                PEOPLE RUNNING 'CAUSE THEY'RE SCARED
                THE PEOPLE BETTER GO AND BEWARE
                NO, NO!  PLEASE--NO!!
                
                
    The all time controversy winner!  Is this not irrefutably  THE song about 
Black Magic in rock?  It's all so obvious, suffuse with evil imagery; Satan, 
walls of flame, figure in black, and damnation at the end.  Yes, I see the 
images too; it definitely concerns Black Magic.  Then again, Shakespeare's 
Macbeth employed scenes of witches involved in conjurations; does that mean 
that Shakespeare was a warlock?  Poe used to write sardonic tragedies about 
twisted murderers and the bizarre nature of acts, did that make him an evil, 
leering, demented killer?  Did either of them advocated what they wrote about?  
One has to remember that writing about something is not necessarily the same as 
emulating it.  Tony Iommi spoke out quite strongly about this:  ""People are 
bringing us down saying that we are a Black Magic group.  I think they must be










getting mixed up with Black Widow.  We don't do any sacrifices on stage, and 
we're not on a black magic kick.  We wanted to do heavy numbers and the guitar 
riffs we worked out were more suited to evil things than love.  We play songs 
about black magic, but they are more likely to be against than for it.""(12)  

    By now, you're probably asking yourself who Black Widow is, right?  Then 
it's time for a little history:

        Sabbath, before they were known as Sabbath, had the same line-up but 
two earlier names.  The first one was Polka Tulk, which seemed sure to doom 
them to obscurity.(13)  The soon realized this and changed the group's name to 
Earth.  Now, Earth was a blues band at the end of the English blues boom.  As 
if that wasn't bad enough, they soon discovered that not only was there another 
group named Earth, but they had also released a single.  To avoid confusion, 
they changed their name again.(14)  But what made them decide on that name?  
Just ask Ozzy:  ""I just liked the name Black Sabbath because of the succession 
of vowel sounds.(15)  If that sounds ludicrous just consider this:  Sabbath was 
""...the first of the really committed, loud and heavy bands...""(16)  They 
needed a name to match the gut-wrenching power they were developing.  Tony knew 
that he wanted Sabbath to be noticed above all the rest of the British blues 
bands:  ""We wanted something of our own that we'd like and people would like.  
And we wanted something loud!""










    Tony didn't hate the blues.  He'd cut his teeth as a guitarist on the likes 
of The Shadows, Buddy Holly and Django Rheinhardt, developing his own style 
from there.  But he realized the group had no future in the blues:

        'We couldn't keep playing 12-bars forever.  We just got fed up with 
Earth music.  It was jazz, blues stuff.  It was good for practice but nothing 
else.'

    In the late 'Sixties, blues groups were a dime a dozen in Birmingham and 
interest was waning in the blues boom due to the glut of groups.  One man, by 
the name of Jim Simpson, had heard Earth around the Birmingham club circuit and 
understood what they were trying to do.  He decided to take them under his 
wing.  With the aid of his massive record collection, Jim expanded the group's 
horizons in the areas of jazz and blues.  He introduced them to artists like 
Wes Montgomery, Count Basie and Jimmy Rushing.  It was from Rushing in 
particular that they derived the repetitive riff style so readily noticeable in 
their later incarnation as Black Sabbath.

    The Count Basie influence is evidenced in the song ""Wicked World"" from the 
first album; Sabbath drummer Bill Ward uses a ""'sighing hi-hat'...in the manner 
of Basie's drummer Jo Jones.""










    The influence is subtle, almost subliminal.  Yet it is one which was not 
thought capable of hard, 'heavy' rock bands in the late 'Sixties.  Although Led 
Zeppelin and Jimi Hendrix also had their work steeped in blues and jazz 
derivations (Hendrix' ""Third Stone From the Sun"" and Zeppelin's version of 
Willie Dixon's ""I Can't Quit You Baby"" from their first album), neither was 
able to match the intense energy of Black Sabbath.  Iommi has always had a 
preference for music with an original, distinct style of its' own; as an 
example, he mentions guitarists Joe Pass and Alvin Lee as two of his strongest 
songwriting influences.

    It would also be necessary that Sabbath develop a unique, distinctive style 
and image of their own.  Though they had changed their name from Earth to Black 
Sabbath to avoid confusion with the other Earth; at the same time another group 
emerged by the name of Black Widow ""...who WERE profoundly influenced by the 
occult, had a male witch as a patron, and wrote pieces like ""Come to The 
Sabbat.""  Unfortunately, Sabbath was constantly reaping the benefits of Widow's 
publicity.

    Sabbath was a group that never minced words.  If they saw something as 
destructive, they would be sure to rub the listener's face it it.  They did not 
want their point to be missed.

    With their straightforward, sometimes brutal way of looking at things, they 
try to shock the listener's conscience back into awareness.  The imagery of 
""Hand of Doom"", from the Paranoid album, is candid and condemning; it is a 
strong statement against drug addiction and rightly so...

    Many people felt the group's overall direction was pessimistic and had a 
negative effect on its listener's due to that.  ""Ozzy insisted that if people 
thought he was having a bad effect on the minds of young kids, they should go 
and watch the TV news where real murder and mayhem were a way of life, and 
shown night after night."" (18)

    Sabbath was never negative in their message; they were simply truthful 
about waht they saw as wrong in the world.  If you ""Strip away the horror 
stories, the imagery and the hysteria, (and) turn down the amps a notch...you 
have a well-rehearsed, solid blues and rock band, powered by a dedication to 
well defined objectives.""  On the top of the list of those objectives was 
truth; Sabbath never feared facing that truth squarely, regardless of what many 
people thought of them.

Long, long, time ago,
I can still remember,
When the local calls were ""free"".
And I knew if I paid my bill,
And never wished them any ill,
That the phone company would let me be...

But Uncle Sam said he knew better,
Split 'em up, for all and ever!
We'll foster competition:
It's good capital-ism!

I can't remember if I cried,
When my phone bill first tripled in size.
But something touched me deep inside,
The day... Bell System... died.

And we were singing...

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

Is your office Step by Step,
Or have you gotten some Crossbar yet?
Everybody used to ask...
Oh, is TSPS coming soon?
IDDD will be a boon!
And, I hope to get a Touch-Tone phone, real soon...

The color phones are really neat,
And direct dialing can't be beat!
My area code is ""low"":
The prestige way to go!

Oh, they just raised phone booths to a dime!
Well, I suppose it's about time.
I remember how the payphones chimed,
The day... Bell System... died.

And we were singing...

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

Back then we were all at one rate,
Phone installs didn't cause debate,
About who'd put which wire where...
Installers came right out to you,
No ""phone stores"" with their ballyhoo,
And 411 was free, seemed very fair!

But FCC wanted it seems,
To let others skim long-distance creams,
No matter 'bout the locals,
They're mostly all just yokels!

And so one day it came to pass,
That the great Bell System did collapse,
In rubble now, we all do mass,
The day... Bell System... died.

So bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

I drove on out to Murray Hill,
To see Bell Labs, some time to kill,
But the sign there said the Labs were gone.
I went back to my old CO,
Where I'd had my phone lines, years ago,
But it was empty, dark, and ever so forlorn...

No relays pulsed,
No data crooned,
No MF tones did play their tunes,
There wasn't a word spoken,
All carrier paths were broken...

And so that's how it all occurred,
Microwave horns just nests for birds,
Everything became so absurd,
The day... Bell System... died.

So bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

We were singing:

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?

                   THE REAL OLD TIME RELIGION

We will all be saved by Mithras       If your rising sign is Aries
We will all be saved by Mithras       You'll be taken by the Fairies

on that Resurrection Day!             where he'll hit you with a pie!

I hear Valkyries a-comin                There are people into Voodoo
In the air their song is comin          there are people into Voodoo
They forgot the words! They're hummin!  I know I do, I hope you do!
But they're good enough for me!         and it's good enough for me!

We will venerate Bubastis             We will read from the Kabahlah

'cause that's good enough for me!     But it's good enough for me!

We will all bow down to Enlil       There are some who practice Shinto
We will all bow down to Enlil       there are some who practice Shinto

With bold Gilgamesh the Brave!      but that's good enough for me!

We will all see Aphrodite               We will all sing Hare Krishna
Though she's pretty wild and flighty    We will all sing Hare Krishna
She will meet us in her nightie         It's not mentioned in the Mishna
And she's good enough for me!           But it's good enough for me!

It was good enough for Loki         We will all go to Nirvana
It was good enough for Loki         We will all go to Nirvana
He thinks Thor's a little hokey     Make a left turn at Urbana
and that's good enough for me!      And you'll see the Promised Land!

Here's to those who copy Conan    There will be a lot of lovin
Here's to those who copy Conan    when we're meetin in our Coven
They're just Followers of Onan    Quit yer pushin and yer shovin
and that's good enough for me!    So there's room enough for me!

We will have a mighty Party           It was good enough for Sappho
In the honor of Astarte               With her lady on her lap-o
Grab your chiton - don't be tardy     She put Lesbos on the map-o
'Cause she's good enough for me!      With her pagan poetry!

Shall we sing a verse for Venus,    Well the Christians all are humming
Of the Gods she is the meanest,     Cause they say their God is coming,
Cause she bit me on my...elbow      Our God came three times this evening
And it's good enough for me.        And that's good enough for me.

We will worship like the Druids,      Some guys have a circumcision
Drinking strange fermented fluids,    On account of their religion,
Running naked through the woo-ids,    An embarrassing incision
Coz that's good enough for me.        Cut just ENOUGH from me!   

We will sing a verse for Loki       It was good for old Jehovah
He's the old Norse god of Chaos     He had a son who was a nova!
Which is why this verse don't       Hey there, Mithras! Move on ova'!
       rhyme or scan or nothin'     Another resurrection Day!
But it's good enough for me...

It was good for Thor and Odin       It could be that you're a Parsi

There are those who, when they've got e-
Normous problems that are knotty
They just take them to Hecate         Thanks to great Quetzacoatl
And that's good enough for me!        And his sacred axolotl
                                      And his gift of chocolatl
Was a time, so I've heard tell, a     And please pass some down to me!
Fine and promising young fella

And that's good enough for me!        But that's good enough for me!

Let us sing the praise of Horus    We went off to worship Venus
As our fathers did before us       By the Gods! You should have seen us!
We're the New Egyptian Chorus      Now the Clinic has to screen us...
And we sing in harmony!            But that's good enough for me!

One-eyed Odin we will follow      We will pray to Zarathustra

Hare Krishna gets a laugh on         I'll arise at early mornin'

Well, that's good enough for me!     To know that's right for me!

Lilith wears a lacy nightie        That Bob Larson shrieks and hollers

And that's good enough for me.      And that's good enough for me.

We will finally pray to Jesus,      We will all go to Nirvana

Eternal life he guarantees us,      Make a left turn at Savannah
And that's good enough for me.      And we'll see the Promised Land.

   Now here's a story, a little bit gory,
   A little bit happy, a little bit sad.
   About a drink called Imperium Compound
   And how the SCA's been had!                       

   Chorus: Oh we think, we think, we think,
           The King is a fink, a fink, a fink,
           A figure of respectability
           Rules the Kingdom thru Imperium Compound
           The results are plain to see!

   Mongol Hordemen, those free-living swordsmen
   Subverting the Kingdoms from underneath!
   Have no use for Imperium Compound
   Except perhaps to brush their teeth!

   AltChorus: Oh we fink, we fink, we fink,
              The Khan and the Kink, the Kink, the Kink,
              And the Board, their Great Senilities!
              The Western Irgun, drinks Imperium Compound
              And we're BACK, with results you'll see!    

   Lady Laurel, with Authority Royal,
   Passes and rejects our heraldry
   She needs a swig of Imperium Compound
   Then perhaps she'd deign to talk to me!            

   Lady Trude thought it her duty
   To turn a social wrong into a Right
   Proved her point with Imperium Compound
   And showed that Cheshire Cats can fight!  //and scratch//

   The Board of Directors styled themselves The Electors
   And another con they tried to swing
   Now the BoD drinks Imperium Compound
   So we no longer need a King!                        

   AltChorus: Oh the Bod, the BoD, the BoD,
              It thinks it is God, is God, is God,
              The figure of Supreme Authority!
              And if we O.D.'d on Imperium Compund
              there'd be no need for Royalty!          

   Oh, MEDIEVAL Net, we thought it was all wet
   With witty remarks, and other kinds of sass
   We'll feed our computers on Imperium Compound
   And BYTE the BoD right on its' righteous ass!         

   Good old Duncan was often drunken
   Chasing all the ladies fair
   He bathed himself in Imperium Compound
   Now he has a little savoir faire!

              The Locks-e-ly Plot, the Plot, the Plot!
              And it works the best when it is underground!
              It isn't a hassle for a green-and-white tassle
              They're the ones that BREW Imperium Compound!  

   Trelon of the Wood, he was very good, he
   Was a leader that had never been beat before;
   But Caid had Imperium Compound,
   And Imperial Roman Caid won the War!  //with help!//   

   In Tyr Ysgithr, it's regularly whispered there
   That the Kingdom is ruled over by a King    // What's THAT? //
   They're ""democratic"" and quite erratic....
   They've forgot the purpose of the whole damn thing!     

   King Sir Mark von, with his pretty white suit on,
   Rules the Kingdom both with Grace and Purity!
   He never touches Imperium Compound
   At least not where anyone else can see!               

   Duke Sir Deaton, was never beaten
   On the field, or in the drinking hall;
   At the Catbox War with Caid,
   Left thirty bodies piled against the wall!             

   Denis O'Titans was good at smitin'
   A Locksley Monster in every single way!
   Drank a little Imperium Compound
   And ATE Deaton's sword that day  // No! REALLY! //       

   Wotan the Mongoloid, a little bit paranoid,
   But a nice guy none the less;
   Drank a mess of Imperium Compound
   Now he's Justin du Roc, I confess!                       

   Then there's Duke Reynard, with a face like a St. Bernard
   Of the Dukes, he is the homliest
   He tends to toke up on Imperium Compound
   And go out and whomp on anybody's best!                   

   This song'll bedevil the folks at a revel,
   And most of the time it will annoy the King,
   So take a drink of Imperium Compound
   And let's go Royalty-bedeviling!                        

   Duchess Anna is quite a fan-a
   Going on a wartime shopping spree!  \\ War Point!\\
   Took a drink of Imperium Compound
   And shopped so fast we couldn't see! \\ Z-o-o-o-om!\\    (5)

                     (more)


  ATEN IMPERIUM (Cont.)

   Lyn of Whitewolfe, made of the right stuff,
   Twice the Queen of Atenveldt;
   Took a drink of Imperium Compound
   And the Kingdom of Caid before her knelt!              

   Duke Sir Brion, and Duke Sir Trelon,
   Won the Crown with regularity;
   Drank a lot of Imperium Compound,
   And founded a dynasty!                                 

   Stephan von Geist, was most awful nice,
   And a chivalrous fighter without any doubt
   Took a swig of Imperium Compound
   And won the Crown his first time out!                    

   All the Crusadenes were big, but not mean,
   And the finest fighters in the town.
   But they all drank Jerusalem Compound,
   Winning Crown after Crown after Crown!                 

   Good Duke Arthur couldn't get no farth-er
   A Norman King in Aten Land
   Drank too much of Imperium Compound
   And went off to conquer Engel-land!                    

   Then King Richard, a bit of a bitch, heard
   A King's Crown could be done.
   Drank a little Imperium Compound
   And became the Aten King, first one!                    

   Duchess Malinda, who doesn't do windas,
   But she does a lot of Duchess Things,
   But give her a LOT of Imperium Compound,
   And she sings and sings and sings and sings and sings!   

   Duke Sir Brion, with his pretty white suit on,
   Is a model of goodness and purity
   Never touches Imperium Compound
(spoken:) And I'll sell ya seashore property in Yuma, too!  

   Optional last verse:

   Many tales abound of Imperium Compound
   And its' strange effects on Royalty,
   But after an hour, this song has no power,
   And by now, it's boring ME!                            

   AltChorus: Oh it's too long, too long, too long
              To sing the whole song, the song, the song
              Longer than a Royal Court, it is!
              But sing it serial, this ditty Imperial
              And you'll be a bardic whiz!

        Last night I had the strangest dream in this bleak century
        I dreamed that people the world around believed in Chivalry

        I dreamed I saw a Kingly Crown enshrined in laurel leaves
        with Grace and Joy and Purity attendant at his feet

        I dreamed I saw the perfect Knight receive his accolade
        and minstrels sang and children laughed in some soft forest glade

        I dreamed I saw the finest thing that ever man could make
        grow great and strong and undefiled: Pray God I never wake!

        Last night I had the strangest dream in this bleak century
        I dreamed that people the world around believed in Chivalry

               (to the tune of ""Good King Wenceslaus"")

                Locksley Monsters never yield
                on the field of battle
                strike the helm and bash the shield
                make their eyeteeth rattle
                Bodies on the ground will lie
                bones will burst in sunder
                search for Locksleys' enemies:
                You'll find them six feet under!

                              SONG OF IVANOF

            There is a man who we know well that does the best he can
            but he's displayed in armour made of reticulated garbage cans!

            He looks so fine and fair and strong, oh how he plays the man
            and how it's prized, those galvanized, reticulated garbage cans

            The noblest Roman of them all, a good Praetorian
            a combatant who wears no pants, judst reticulated garbage cans!

            Like old Horatius at the Bridge, like the Legions of Valerian
            (O dearie me: those LOVELY knees!)
            and those reticulated garbage cans!

         (sung to the tune (obviously) of the 12 Days of Christmas)


1.           The first time I sent my device, The Heralds said to me

            ""It violates the Rule of Three""

2.           The next time I tried it, the Heralds said to me

            ""We changed the forms, and it violates the Rule of
             Three"".

3.           The third time I tried, and the Heralds said to me, 

            ""We upped the fees, we changed the forms, and it
             violates the Rule of Three"".

4.           Another time I tried and the Heralds said to me,
 
            ""We haven't got it, we upped the fees, we changed the 
             forms, and it violates the Rule of Three"".

5.           The fifth time I tried it, the Heralds said to me,  

            ""In a decision rendered by the College of Arms on
             August 1st, A.S. V it was decided that this style of
             heraldic design was not appropriate to the aims and 
             intentions of the Corporate Body. Holy! Holy! Holy! ""

 note: verse 5 is delivered in an extremely fast, mono-
       tone, similiar to a Gregorian Chant.

           "" ....we haven't got it, we upped the fees, we changed the forms,
             and it violates the Rule of Three.""

6.           I tried it a sixth time, and the Heralds said to me,

            ""We changed the rules, &c""

7.           A seventh time I tried and, the Heralds said to me,

            ""It's against the Rule of Tincture, we changed the
             rules, &c""

8.           I tried it once again and the heralds said to me,

            ""It's not a Period design, It's against the Rule of Tincture, We
             changed the rules, &c""

                                * more *



    Heralds Said To Me (cont.)

9.           I sent it in once more, and the Heralds said to me,

            ""We changed the rules again, It's not a Period design,
             it's against the Rule of Tincture, we changed the
             rules, &c""

10. (sung in cold anger)
             The LAST time I sent my device, the Heralds said to me

    (sung in a state of SMUG)
             ""Someone else has got it, &c""




              (nb: every single one of these reasons has been used by the
              CoA, at one point or another, to reject perfectly good
              heraldry, along with some even MORE stupid.  If the shoe 
              fits....................!!!!!!!!)

           or: Who was that Vermin I saw you with last, Knight?
   or: There may be Lice on all you Knice, but there ain't no Lice on me

           Once there was a Barony howling in the wilderness
           nestled in the Valley where the River doesn't flow
           and the folks were driven buggy by the insects in the Revel Hall
           Authenticity is wonderful, but this doesn't go!

                   Bugs on the Baroness, bugs on the Baroness!
                   That was the cry that you heard all the day
                   and the scratching can be heard from Ysgithr to Ered Sul
                   why did we come here? Let's go away!

           See them all a scratching, nestled in their armour tight
           the fleas have a melee team that's challenging the field!
           call Truly Nolen! Someone's gotta help us out!
           the crabs are nesting in our helms but we'll never yield!

                   (chorus)

           Dawn comes a-breaking, the bugs have won the Coronet...
           flea-infested Conan-clones in piles upon the lawn
           where is the Barony? The bugs have eaten everyone...
           termites got the stick-jocks, and all their sticks are gone!

                  For all the Lands where I have dwelt
                  Oh Atenveldt, Oh Atenveldt
                  till rivers burn and mountains melt
                  lest I forget my Atenveldt
                  From deserts stark to snow-capped peaks
                  from silent lakes and laughing creeks
                  sing: Oh let man find his heart's ease
                  on rocky plains
                  in desert breeze

                  For oft I thought of mighty men
                  who carved a Land with sword and pen
                  and lit a candle, burning bright,
                  that pierced the darkness; stirred the night!
                  tho some are gone their deeds remain
                  this sunny Crown without a stain
                  sing: Oh, their deeds were not in vain!
                  in sunlit days
                  and falling rain.....

                  So raise your banners, blazoned bright
                  Advance the Dream and Shine the Light!
                  in battle's crash and Revel's song
                  raise high the Flag and wave it long!
                  For all the Lands wherein I've dwelt
                  I love you best, my Atenveldt!
                  Sing: Oh the Joy that I have felt!

      What the use of wearing panties
      whalebone corsets of your Auntie's
      boxer shorts and other scanties
      best of all is nude
      there's such fun in going bra-less
      now that it's no longer lawless
      'specially if your figure's flawless
      best of all is nude
      nude is what you're born in
      shirts are never torn in
      underwear and lacy flimsies, garter belts and other whimsies
      yards of itchy cloth to put your form in
      ducks all do it, maidens rue it
      even ancient Picts in Britain blue it
      going naked's how to do it
      best of all is nude!

      If your garters aren't elastic
      tie them up in knots fantastic
      (panty hose is something drastic!)
      best of all is nude!
      If you're tired of wearing clotheses
      shed your garment 'mongst the roses
      never mind the old bluenoses
      best of all is nude!
      Nude is best for ducking!
      Worst for horses bucking!
      Moonlit nights will see such sights
          that are very best for fooling round
                              .....and elbows!
      Nudity is grand to see
       a well-known antidote to virginity
      take your clothes off and you'll see:
      best of all is nude!

               I'll tell you a tale of Peace and Love
                       whack fol the diddle o the di do day
               Of those that Rule all Lands above
                       whack fol the diddle o the di do day
               may Peace, and Plenty be their share
               that keep our Empire in repair
               God save the Directors is our prayer!
                       whack fol the diddle o the di do day

               chorus: whack fol the diddle o the di do day
                       so we cry! It's no lie!
                       God save the Directors up on high!
                       whack fol the diddle o the di do day

               When we were Sauvage, Fierce and Wilde
               they came as a Mother to her childe
               they gently raised us from the slime
               and kept our hands from Hellishe Crime
               and made us a Kingdom in their own good time

               Now, Atenveldt forgets the Past
               and thinks on a Day that's coming fast
               when we shall all be....civilized....(puke)
               neat, and clean.....and WELL-ADVISED
               oh won't the Directors be....suprised?!

                    WEAPONS AT THE DOOR

 Being a Polemic concerning the alleged Custom of the West Kingdom concerning 
 checking your Weapons at the Door of the Revel Hall. As the Satire is the 
 Weapon of the Bard, this said Polemic is to be checked at the Door, along with 
 swords, knives, redheaded Ladies and other such Deadly Things.....

         As I roved out to Western Lands to take the Western Air
         I went into a Revel Hall and I saw a Twelfth Night there
         but I was halted at the gate by a Privy Consellor
                 (that's the man who tells the King of the West how to go to
                  the bath room!)
         who told me I would have to check my Weapons at the door

         As I, in my astonishment, stood hung on tenter-pegs
         a Knight came in whose Prouess hung down between his legs
         the Doorman grabbed a greatsword and he struck the Knight full sore
         and gave him a reciept; he left his weapon at the door!

         a Bard was next whose goodly Voice has entertained us all
         but he, too, was prevented from entering the Hall
         and told he could not carry deadly weapons on the floor
         he left his Voice and Harp among the weapons at the door

         a Master entered graciously, a man we all know well
         who holds a 3rd Dan Black Belt, tho this he'd never tell
         the Master struggled valiantly, the Master cursed and swore
         but he left his hands, and feet, as weapons at the door

         the company was jovial, altho a bit dismayed
         for lack of proper cutlery, down to the smallest blade
         for even teeth and fingernails, each can be used in War
         were cut, and pulled, and left behind, as weapons at the door!

         And has their King not loyal Knights that He must be afraid
         of brawling in his Hall and of Assassin's bloody blade?
         the Rights of Men to carry Arms at least WE'VE not foreswore
         and a POX on them that made the Rule of Weapons at the Door!

                           THE STREETS OF ANN ARBOR

               As I walked out thru the streets of Ann Arbor
               as I walked out thru Ann Arbor one day
               I spied a young Mongol all dressed in white linen
               all dressed in white linen and cold as the clay

               I then spied another, done in on the sidewalk
               along with just about six dozen more
               their wounds were all gaping, from mace and from braoadsword
               from claymore and cannon, all dripping with gore

               what caused this grave carnage, I cried to the Monglos
               oh pray what's the reason for this awful sight
               my answer came slowly from under the corpse-pile
               ""It seems that our bark is much worse than our bite.....""

               the answer continued from pale lips a-shaking
               we sang all our songs and believed them as true
               the Dark Horde could never be beaten in battle
               we thought this was what all good Mongols could do...

               we went down to Atenveldt all for to plunder
               ""too large to defend"" was our song every night
               but Atenveldt's different from East, West or Middle
               there, even the bushes have learned how to bite!

               the Clann stole our ponies, the Scraelings our foodstuffs
               we ran into axes in AtenViking hands
               our maidens ran off with one Richard of Arkham
               and we're all that's left to return to our lands

               MacChluarains and Monsters, Lockehaven and Foxmoor
               that Kingdom is BIG and its' fighters are MEAN!
               we fought and we lost, and fled back to Ann Arbor
               we all came back home with results that you've seen

               keep away from that Land with its' cactus and marshes
               it's no place for Mongols who are bent on War
               they count their blows well, but they strick them yet better
               he crawled into his Yurt, and fell, dead, on the floor.....

                            C. A. Bethancourt III
       tune: the song of the Cowardly Lion, Tin Woodsman and Scarecrow
             in the movie version of the Wizard of Oz

        (Enter the Scarecrow, who singeth:)

        My wife is always nagging; my Prowess it is lagging
        I can't do anything
        she has got a reason, but revenge is out of season
        Oh I wish I could be King!

        If I just had the Crown on, I'd always have a frown on
        and the Barons on a string
        Heads they would be rolling, the Board would be cajoling
        Oh if only I was King!

        I am very fed up with the way this group is set up
        Oh I'd change everything!
        they are so high and mighty with the way that they do fight-ey
        Oh, someday I'll be King!

        Tho my wife is melancholic, and very...vitriolic
        she's a wasp without a sting!
        I'd have to supervise her with a pack of tranquilizers
        If I only was a King......

        (the Tin Woodsman joineth him, and singeth:)

        I grew up kind of cocky, and rather big, and stocky
        and straight as any rod
        on the field I'm a battallion, with the Ladies I'm a stallion
        ...Oh they'd better make me God!

        The other boys are jealous they say I'm over-zealous
        they'd do better to applaud
        the things that I am giving to this Dream that we are living
        oh I wish they'd make me God!

        They say that I'm conceited, but I'm just badly treated
        by people and by BoD
        just think of what they're missing by My Majesty dismissing
        Oh they'd better make me God!

        (the Cowardly Lion creepeth forth, and singeth:)

        Oh I could be a fighter, a great and mighty smiter
        and be the perfect knight
        it's a great and nasty shame, and everyone's to blame
        oh I wish that I could fight!

        Song of the Three (cont.)

        I could be a Cavalier drinking wine and ale and beer
        and be a gorgeous sight
        but it would cost me too much money so it isn't very funny
        oh I wish that I could fight!                               

        Let me at 'em on the field, I would surely make them yield
        to my Power and my Might
        with rattan, shinai and rapier they would nevermore escape here
        If they'd only let me fight

                She was afraid to come out to the Tourney
                She was worried that ""something might show..""
                She was afraid to come out to the Tourney
                And the poor thing did NOT want to go...

                  (2 - 3 - 4, tell the people what she wore!)

                  It was an itsy bitsy teeny weenie little rabbit fur bikini

                  An itsy bitsy teenie weenie little rabbit fur bikini
                  And in her apartment she wanted to stay!

                One day in the Kingdom of the Middle
                It happened at a Tourney one day:
                The Mongols invaded the Middle
                But the Middle did not want to play...

                  (eins - zwei - drei, but the Dark Horde wouldn't die!)

                  It was an itsy bitsy tiny teenie Nauseating Mongol weenie
                  That they saw, for the first time, that day.
                  An itsy bitsy tiny teenie Nauseating Mongol weenie
                  And the Mongols did NOT go away!

                Now the Heralds made up a new Rulebook
                And to read it is some kind of gas!
                It's a bureaucrat's dream, this new Rulebook

                  I want an itsy bitsy teenie weenie little rabbit fur bikini

                  An itsy bitsy teenie weenie little rabbit fur bikini
                  But ""that's offensive"" the Heralds all say!

                I sat down at the Revel last evening
                To a feast of green meat, and Rat Pie...
                It was cold, and disgusting, and greasy
                And I just want to upchuck and die!

                  (6 - 7 - 8, tell them what was on your plate!)

                  It was an itsy bitsy teenie weenie little rabbit fur bikini

          Some folks call me many names, others call me crazy
          Tom O'Bedlam's son am I, for my mind is hazy!
          I'd rather sing a song than work (if it's not too phrasey!)
          Lengthy rhymes don't bother me....truth to tell: I'm lazy!

          Yang, your yurt is very nice, and your Horde is smelly,
          And I'm sure that yak-meat will nicely fill one's belly!
          But remember this one line, or you're not worth jelly:
          FIRST you plunder, THEN you burn! That's how to be rakehelly!

          My Lady Lorelei your eyes do drive me to distraction
          And the lovely Care-Cheri causes....petrifaction!
          But I, and they, quite taken are, so I can't take action...
          Therefore, Ladies, fill my cup; I'll drink to stupefaction!

          Now Atenveldt your fighters, all, are most good and gentle
          And the Ladies, bless 'em all, are most ornamental!
          But that little Nikki-Toad....has me sentimental
          Though with boffer in her hand she is argumental!

          This stupid little song, m'lords, is mostly sung in Latin
          By the Goliards, of course, from vespers clear to matins!
          But I prefer a coarser cloth over silk or satins
          English is more understood, mine enemies to flatten!

          Good People all, I've made my Song, its' music's well-recited
          But my voice could use some work; the flowers it has blighted!
          It's rude and rusty, grim and bad, and squeaky like a door-hinge,
          But I'm a better Bard than you: I found a rhyme for ""orange!""

 (note to verse 4: Nichelle of Whitewolfe is now a very beautiful young Lady
 resident in Caid. This verse was written when she was 2 years old. Ask HER!

                      by William Poundstone
                              1983

     Two mentalities are at work here: 1960s rock fans and 1980s
fundamentalist Christians. The idea of phonographically concealed
messages dates from the Paul McCartney death scare of 1969. For
hard-core types, the secret-message rumors never really died. Avid
rock fans have auditioned ever album release since the late 1960s
for hidden nuances. Backward messages, barely audible messages,
and messages on one stereo track only have been alleged. At the
other end of the sociosensual spectrum, fundamentalist Christians
have gotten into the act. TV programs such as PRAISE THE LORD and
THE 700 CLUB have propagated rumors of a satanic plot in the
recording industry, no less, in which various albums conceal
""backward-masked"" demonic murmurings. If THAT sounds too spacey to
be taken seriously, consider that it was the fundamentalist groups
who were behind House Resolution 6363, a bill introduced in the
U.S. House of Representatives by Robert K. Dornan (R., Calif.) in
1982 to label all suspect records: ""WARNING: THIS RECORD CONTAINS
BACKWARD MASKING THAT MAKES A VERBAL STATEMENT WHICH IS AUDIBLE
WHEN THIS RECORD IS PLAYED BACKWARD AND WHICH MAY BE PERCEPTIBLE
AT A SUBLIMINAL LEVEL WHEN THIS RECORD IS PLAYED FORWARD."" In
February 1983, the Arkansas State Senate passed a similar record-
labeling bill by a vote of 86 to 0.
     Contributing to the quasi-occult status of these rumors is
the difficulty of checking them out on home audio equipment. You
pretty much have to take someone else's word for it, or dismiss
the rumors out of hand.
     From a technical standpoint, there are four simple ways to
conceal a verbal message on a recording. The most obvious is to
record the message at a very low volume. The message may then be
recovered by turning the volume up while playing the record or
tape. If the message is faint enough, though, noise levels of home
equipment may garble it. If the accompanying music or lyrics are
loud enough, or if the message itself is indistinct or
electronically modified, it may be hard to hear on any equipment.
     A second gimmick is to record a message on one stereo track
only. Records and tapes have two independent recordings, of
course, normally played simultaneously for stereo effect. On a
record, each stereo track occupies on one side of the V-shaped
groove for the needle. On a tape, the tracks are recorded in
parallel lanes of the magnetic material. The two tracks are called
""right"" and ""left"" after the stereo speakers they will play on.
Otherwise, the tracks are interchangeable -- the sound mixer can
put anything he or she wants on each track. A message on one track
can be masked by simultaneous loud music or lyrics on the opposite
track. With normal stereo balance (or mono equipment) the loud
track drowns out the message track. At home, single-track messages
can be recovered by adjusting the stereo balance so that only the
desired track plays. Sometimes this trick also makes indistinct
words clearer. Even if the words are not exclusively on one track,
they may happen to be more audible on one track.
     A message could be recorded at a speed different from the
rest of the record. Then the record would have to be played faster
or slower than usual to recover the message. Unless the message
was at one of the standard speeds (say, 45 rpm on a 33 1/3 rpm
record), it could not be played normally on home equipment.
     The fourth and most commonly alleged trick is to record a
verbal message backward. Reversed speech has several unexpected
features. One is that syllables are not a constant in the reversal
process. A one-syllable word can have two or three syllables when
played backward. Thus ""number nine"" in the Beatles' REVOLUTION 9
reverses to ""Turn me on, dead man"" (or something like it), a jump
from three to five syllables.
     There is no simple way to predict what a word or phrase will
sound like reversed. Obviously, you can't just reverse the
letters.
     Reversed messages are difficult to recover at home. Record
turntables are not built to go backwards. Some have a neutral
setting, in which the pickup and amplifier remain active and you
can turn the record backward by hand. But hardly anyone has a
stead enough hand to produce satisfactory results.
     With patience, it is possible to reverse a cassette
recording. Transfer the music from the original record or tape
onto a blank tape cassette. Place the cassette flat on a table.
Draw our the part of the tape with the suspected message and snip
it off at both ends. Hold the tape segment horizontally. Rotate it
180 degrees, keep it horizontal at all times. This turns the tape
end for end. Splice the reversed tape segment back onto the two
loose ends of the cassette with strong adhesive tape. Reel the
tape back inside the cassette. The sliced segment will play
backward on an ordinary cassette player.
     I rented a recording studio to test the secret-message
rumors. New copiies of the records in question were transcribed on
a quarter-inch master tape. Where rumor alleged that a single
stereo track contained a message, right and left stereo tracks
were transcribed separately. Records with alleged inaudible
messages were treated similarly. To test claims of reversed
messages, recordings on the master tape were edited out and
spliced in backward. Twenty cuts or portions of cuts from sixteen
albums were tested.


""Another One Bites the Dust""
Queen, THE GAME

Rumor: When played backward, the lyrics say, ""It's fun to smoke
marijuana.""
Findings: There is something that sounds like ""It's fun to smoke
marijuana"" in the reversed music. It is repeated over and over. It
might be rendered no less faithfully, however, as ""sfun to scout
mare wanna."" This ""message"" is the reversal of the song title,
which is repeated as a line in the song.
     Let's make a distinction between engineered and phonetic
reversals. When an artist records a verbal statement, reverses it
by turning the tape end for end, mixes the reversed statement onto
a master tape, and has records and tapes produced from the master,
that is an engineered reversal. When the phonetic properties of
song lyrics are such that they can be reversed to sound like
something else, that is a phonetic reversal.
     ""It's fun to smoke marijuna"" is clearly a phonetic reversal.
The lyrics are perfectly plain played forward (""Another one bites
the dust""), no so plain played backward (""sfun to scout mare
wanna""). With an engineered reversal, the opposite should hold
true: gibberish forward, clear as a bell backward. Some are
prepared to believe that phonetic reversals are just as
intentional as engineered reversals -- that the songwriter
painstakinginly planned the phonetic double-entendre. In the
absence of confirming evidence, that just doesn't wash. It's too
easy to find coincidences. If, for example, the letters of the
alphabet are recited in conventional fashion (Ay, Bee, Cee, etc.)
and reversed, at least five sound like English language words. D
reverses to ""eden,"" F becomes ""pray,"" S becomes ""say,"" V becomes
""even,"" and Z becomes ""easy."" ""It's fun to smoke marijuana"" is
likewise a coincidence.


""A Child is Coming""
Jefferson Starship, BLOWS AGAINST THE EMPIRE

Rumor: When played backward, ""son of Satan.""
Findings: Another phonetic coincidence. The repeated ""It's getting
better"" reverses to an iffy ""son of Satan,"" the ""of"" drawn out and
the ""Satan"" strongly accented on the first syllable.


""Eldorado""
Electric Light Orchestra, ELDORADO

Rumor: When played backward, ""He is the nasty one/ Christ, you're
infernal/ It is said we're dead men/ Everyone who has the mark
will live.""
Findings: Coincidence. The supposed message lurks around the line
""On a voyage of no return to see."" Reversed, this passage becomes
the expected syllable salad -- no one hearing it would describe it
as anything but reversed music. Only if you listen while reading
along with what you're supposed to hear will you get anything. The
rumored version of the message is somewhat fudged. The passage
sounds more like ""He's to nasty one/ Christ you are, Christ,
you're fernal/ There wiss uh, we're dead men..."" There is no ""in""
in what is taken to be ""infernal."" The line that is supposed to be
""Everyone who has the mark will live"" isn't even close, though the
syllable count is right.


""Shoo Be Doo""
The Cars, CANDY-O

Rumor: When played backward, the word ""Satan"" repeated
approximately eleven times.
Findings: Coincidence. The rumor refers to the reversal of the ""Shoo
be doo, shoo be doo, shoo be doo..."" near the end of the song. Given
the mysterious logic of reversed phonemes, these three-syllable units
can be hard as a repeated two-syllable word. The word sounds a little
like ""Satan.""


""Snowblind""
Styx, PARADISE THEATER

Rumor: According to a mimeographed list of suspect records distributed
by Congressman Dornan, the words ""Satan move through our voices"" when
played backwards.
Findings: Negative. Despite repeated listenings, it was not even
possible to identify the part of the reversed track that Dornan et al.
are talking about.


""Stairway to Heaven""
Led Zeppelin, untitled, a.k.a. STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN

Rumor: In reverse, ""I live for Satan... The Lord turns me off...
There's no escaping it... Here's to my sweet Satan... There's power in
Satan... He will give you 666.""
Findings: Coincidence. If you listen very carefully to the ""And it
makes me wonder"" lines in reverse, you'll hear something approaching
""There's no escaping it."" A better description is ""There's no escape
do."" Knock of the last syllable, and you have ""There's no escape,"" a
complete, intelligible sentence in reverse. It's there, all right, but
it's not an unlikely enough coincidence to -- well, make you wonder.
      The ""Satan"" in ""I live for Satan"" is good and clear. The ""I live
for"" part isn't. The other alleged lines are unremarkable. All are
phonetic reversals of the entirely lucid forward lyrics and obviously
just accidents.


""When Electricity Came to Arkansas""
Black Oak Arkansas, BLACK OAK ARKANSAS and RONCH AND ROLL

Rumor: In reverse, ""Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan. He is God. He
is God.""
Findings: The BLACK OAK ARKANSAS cut was reversed. Again, pairs of
reversed syllables are being freely interpreted as ""Satan."" ""He is
God"" was not identifiable.


""Rain""
The Beatles, HEY JUDE

Rumor: Unintelligible lyrics at the end are reversed.
Findings: A true engineered reversal and not really a secret. ""Rain""
seems to have been the first popular recording to incorporate an
obviously reversed lyric. The story is that John Lennon accidentally
spliced the last part of the song in backward and liked the effect.
When reversed, the strange-sounding vocals at the end become
intelligible as a reprise starting with the drawn-out word
""sunshine.""
      The reversal is less apparent to the casual listener than it
might be because the accompanying music is not reversed. The ending
fits in smoothly with the rest of the song, the vocals suggesting a
foreign language.


""Fire on High""
Electric Light Orchestra, FACE THE MUSIC

Rumor: When played backward, ""The music is reversible, but time --
turn back!""
Findings: ""Fire on High"" is instrumental. About twenty-six seconds
into the music, scrambled speech is heard. It is mostly louder than
the accompanying music and begins with a two-syllable unit repeated
several times. The seeming speech lasts for about fourteen seconds.
      Reversing the music confirms that there is a true, engineered
message. In reverse, a voice (Jeff Lynne's?) says, ""The music is
reversible, but time -- turn back! Turn back! Turn back! Turn back!""
All the words are clear and unambiguous. Anyone comparing this to the
alleged reversal on ELO's ""Eldorado"" will have no trouble telling
which is genuine.


""Goodbye Blue Sky""
Pink Floyd, THE WALL

Rumor: In reverse, ""You have discovered the secret message.""
Findings: The ""secret message"" is at the very end of the instrumental
passage following the ""Goodbye Blue Sky"" vocals. It comes just before
the words ""What shall we do"" at the start of the song that is
identified as ""Empty Spaces"" on the record label and as ""What shall we
do now?"" on the record sleeve. Played forward, the message is less
apparent than the FACE THE MUSIC reversal: A reasonably attentive
listener might play THE WALL through and not catch it. It suggests
speech not quite close enough to be overheard. In context this is not
unusual because the ""Goodbye Blue Sky"" instrumental passage includes
""airport noises"" and other sound effects. A loud climax in the music
further masks the unintelligible voice.
      When played backward, the voice (Roger Waters?) plainly intones,
""Congratulations, you have just discovered the secret message. Please
send your answer to old Pink, care of the funny farm..."" As the voice
fades out, there may be another word -- perhaps ""Chalfonte or
""Chelsea"" -- after ""funny farm.""


""Heavy Metal Poisoning""
Styx, KILROY WAS HERE

Rumor: A red sticker on the KILROY WAS HERE cover warns, ""By order of
the Majority for Musical Morality, this album contains secret backward
messages...""
Findings: This is a case of second-generation backward-masking. Styx'
PARADISE THEATER did not contain a backward message, though a lot of
people said it did. So Styx has included a sure enough backward
message on KILROY WAS HERE. It is at the very beginning of ""Heavy
Metal Poisoning."" The reversed speech last about three seconds. There
is no musical background. The words reverse to ""Annuit coeptis. Novus
ordo seclorum."" This is the Latin motto encircling the pyramid on the
back of a dollar bill. The usual translation: ""God has favored our
undertakings. A new order of the ages.""
      The cover sticker's ""Majority for Musical Morality"" is a
fictitious Falwellesque group in the KILROY WAS HERE video. Although
the sticker suggests a plurality of ""messages,"" only one was found.


Space between ""I'm So Tired"" and ""Blackbird""
The Beatles, untitled, a.k.a. THE WHITE ALBUM

Rumor: A reversed message. At the time of the Paul-is-dead stories,
the segue from ""I'm So Tired"" to ""Blackbird"" was offered as evidence.
It was held to contain John Lennon's voice, reveresed, saying ""Paul is
dead, miss him, miss him, miss him."" That interpretation seems
unlikely now, but there is a mysterious low muttering between the
songs.
Findings: The mumbling is actually just to the ""I'm So Tired"" side of
the shiny ""space"" between cuts on the record. Each of the stereo
tracks was recorded separately, twice, and a copy of each track was
reversed. This produced four versions of the two-second passage: right
forward, left forward, right reversed, and left reversed. All were
equally unintelligible. It was not even apparent whether the voice is
forward or reversed. Nor could John Lennon be identified as the
speaker. There are nine or ten syllables. The first six (when played
forward) are a two-syllable unit repeated three times. There is little
or no difference betwen the stereo tracks. Any claimed interpretation
of the sounds seems doubtful.


""Strawberry Fields Forever""
The Beatles, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR

Rumor: It was, of course, claimed that John Lennon says ""I buried
Paul"" at the end. (It's forward, at the very end after the music
fades to complete silence, returns, and starts to fade out again.)
But Lennon told ROLLING STONE that the words are ""cranberry
sauce.""
Findings: They are ""cranberry sauce."" The ""sauce""/""Paul"" part is
indistinct, but the first syllable sounds a lot more like ""cran""
than ""I.""


""Baby You're a Rich Man""
The Beatles, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR

Rumor: On one of the tracks the line ""Baby you're a rich man too""
is sung as ""Baby you're a rich fag Jew,"" a dig at Brian Epstein.
Or some think it's ""rich fat Jew"" and claim it as evidence of
Beatle anti-Semitism.
Findings: Negative. The two stereo tracks are nearly identical.
It's always possible to hear words as similar-sounding words, but
basically, the lyrics jibe with the published version.


""Revolution 9""
The Beatles, untitled, a.k.a. THE WHITE ALBUM

Rumor: Various reversed and/or one-track speech. The reversal of
""Number nine"" to ""Turn me on, dead man"" has pretty much been
discounted as coincidence (though it appears on Congressman
Dornan's list).
Findings: Distinction between lyrics and any hidden message blurs
on ""Revolution 9."" The eight-minute cut is a montage of sounds
collected by John Lennon and Yoko Ono. It includes discordant
music, radio broadcasts, sirens, applause, gunfights, sports
cheers, the crackling of a fire, screams, a baby gurgling, a choir
singing, and much that cannot be identified. For this
investigation, ""Revolution 9"" was transcribed four times, twice on
each stereo channel. One copy of each of the tracks was reversed.
The four resulting versions were compared with each other and
against the original two-channel version.
     ""Revolution 9"" contains a lot of talking. Played in stereo,
forward, the longest stretch of understandable speech is probably
an announcer saying, ""...every one of them knew that as time went
by they'd get a little bit older and a little bit slower...""
     One believable instance of reversed speech occurs: someone
saying ""Let me out! Let me out!"" (once held to represent McCartney
in his totaled Aston-Martin). Two iffy reversals occur on the
backward recording of the right stereo track:""She used to be
assistant"" and ""There were two men..."" Neither is clear enough or
long enough to be convincing. Some of the music, including the
recurring theme, sounds more natural in reverse.
     ""Turn me on, dead man"" is a typical phonetic reversal. The
forward ""number nine"" (repeated throughout the cut) is clear; the
reversal is slurred -- something like ""turn me on dedmun."" It has
been claimed that ""number nine"" must be pronounced with a British
accent or with some careful inflection in order to reverse to
""Turn me on, dead man."" This seems not to be so. As an experiment,
three American-accent renderings of ""number nine"" were reversed.
All sound about as much like ""Turn me on, dead man"" as the record
did. Like the other phonetic reversals, ""Turn me on, dead man""
must be considered a coincidence.
     Much of ""Revolution 9"" is on one stereo track only. Near the
end a voice says ""A fine natural imbalance...the Watusi...the
twist...Eldorado...Eldorado."" ""A fine natural imbalance"" is on the
right track only, though the words that follow are in stereo. One
of the longer bits of speech -- ""Who could tell what he was
saying? His voice was low and his [unintelligible] was high and
his eyes were low"" -- is clear on the left track, a bare whisper
on the right.
     There is a stereophonically concealed ""secret message"" on
""Revolution 9."" The words are on the right track. They begin about
four minutes, fifty-eight seconds into the cut and run for about
twenty-two seconds. They are not likely to be noticed in stereo
because of the much louder left track. The sound of applause
begins on the left track at about five minutes, one second into
the cut. Deafening noises -- the clapping, sirens, music --
continue on the left track until five minutes, forty seconds. It
may or may not have been Lennon's and Ono's intention to conceal
the spoken passage. Given the haphazard quality of ""Revolution 9,""
the concealment may have been accidental. To recover the passage,
the left track must be switched off. The right track can then be
heard to contain a sound like a stopwatch ticking, behind these
words:

     So the wife called, and we better go to see a
     surgeon....[A SCREAM MUFFLES A LINE THAT SOUNDS LIKE
     Well, what with the prices, the prices have snowballed,
     no wonder it's closed.] ...So any and all, we went to
     see the dentist instead, who gave him a pair of teeth,
     which wasn't any good at all. So instead of that he
     joined the bloody navy and went to sea.
                      by William Poundstone
                              1986

     There really are backward messages on rock albums. And the
controversy over ""backward masking"" and ""porn rock"" has inspired a
whole new spate of messages. There may have been more genuine
backward messages in the past few years than ever before.
     The backward message controversy is usually traced to the
1960s and John Lennon's avant-garde sound mixing on such tracks as
""Revolution 9"" on the Beatles' WHITE ALBUM. Lennon probably wasn't
trying to conceal a message so much as create an interesting
sound.
     The matter might have ended right there had it not been for
the Paul McCartney death rumor. College kids tried playing Beatles
records forward, backward, and at various speeds to find ""clues""
to McCartney's fate. In the process they found snippets of speech
from Lennon's experiments. Even after McCartney was found safe and
sound in Scotland, some listeners continued to look for hidden
messages.
     Somehow, fundamentalist Christian groups became convinced
(ca. 1982) that the alleged messages were commercials for devil
worship. Not a single indisputable satanic message has turned up,
but there were scattered attempts to ban or label certain albums.
In 1986 one fundamentalist group announced that the theme song for
the old MR. ED TV show contains the word ""Satan"" when played
backward.)
     Ironically, the publicity accorded nonexistent messages has
inspired several artists -- among them porn rock hearing witness
Frank Zappa -- to hide real background messages in their music.
It's easy to do.
     The performer speaks or sings the message normally, then
reverses the tape, which is mixed into the soundtrack. This is all
accomplished simply enough at any recording studio.
     What's not so simple is playing it back. More home record,
cassette, and compact disk players won't play backward. You can
turn a record backward with a pencil eraser, but it's not good for
the needle or the turntable. The only way to reproduce the message
with full fidelity is to use a professional-quality reel-to-reel
tape player and splice the tape in backward.
     We used the facilities of KLOS radio in Los Angeles to
reverse some recent records containing true backward messages.


""Secret Messages""
Electric Light Orchestra, SECRET MESSAGES

ELO's ELDORADO album was among those alleged to contain satanic
backward masked messages. A patient listening to ELDORADO played
backward reveals no such messages. You hear only what you ought to
hear -- the reversed lyrics of the songs, which sound nothing like
the ""messages"" claimed to be there. In the wake of such
allegations, ELO did put an (innocuous) backward message on their
FACE THE MUSIC album. Perhaps they thought this would show how
silly the allegations were. Instead, the backward-masking people
seized on this as proof that the other ""messages"" were real. In
the latest volley, ELO has named an album after the controversy.
     In Britain (where the backward-masking issue is viewed as an
American eccentricity), the cover of SECRET MESSAGES has a mock
warning label to youth about the hidden label. Word of the albums'
impending release in the United States caused enough of a furor to
chill CBS Records into deleting the cover blurb.
     The reversed message is easy to find. It's at the beginning
of the first song, which is itself called ""Secret Messages."" You
can hear reversed speech when you play the record normally. A
voice intones ""secret messages"" -- forward -- in the middle of the
reversed speech, lest anyone dare be so unhip as to not know
what's going on.
     We transferred a new copy of SECRET MESSAGES to reel-to-reel
tapes and played it backward. The backward message goes: ""WELCOME
TO THE BIG SHOW/ WELCOME TO THE BIG SHOW.""
     That's it.


""Ya Hozna""
Frank Zappa, THEM OR US

""Ya Hozna,"" a six-minute composition on the first record of the
THEM OR US double album, is ENTIRELY backward. The albums' inner
cover, which includes lyrics for the other songs, says, ""backwards
vocal -- you figure it out"" of this cut. It credits Frank and Moon
Zappa, George Duke, and Napoleon Murphy Brock as vocalists.
     Played forward, ""Ya Howza"" sounds like a record played
backward -- reasonably so. The vocals are prominent and
unintelligible. Moon Zappa's voice is curiously recognizable, even
in reverse. It is hard to tell whether the music was recorded
forward or backward.
     When ""Ya Howza"" is played in reverse, you discover that the
music is virtually a palindrome -- it sounds about the same
forward and backward. The voices are all backward. In some cases
they have been modified electronically. Many of the words are
muffled. Even after repeated careful listening on both stereo
tracks, it is difficult to make out many of the lyrics. It doesn't
help that some of the words seem to be stream-of-consciousness
nonsense. Some of the unintelligible stuff sounds like opera.
     Starting at the beginning of the reversed tape -- the end of
the forward tape -- the clearer vocals go like this: ""I am the
heaven, I am the water."" This is in a hymnlike register. ""You are
a lonely little girl./ But your mommy and your daddy hold you."" A
singsong synthesizer voice.
     The most interesting part of the lyrics is an intermittently
orgasmic rap in Moon Zappa's Valley Girl voice. There are three
short monologues:

I'm like green!
I'm like squat!
I'm like soul!
Repeat, like soul!
I'm like pull, push,
Okay, like slow, slow.

You're never too old
Like slow, like slow, like slow
Okay, I like it.


All right, faster, faster,
Go, do it, do it twice,
Yeah, that feels good,
I'm looking great,
Yeah, fer shure!
Like, no way!


""No Anchovies, Please""
J. Geils Band, LOVE STINKS

""No Anchovies, Please"" is a novelty song, really a narration with
sound effects, about a woman who is kidnapped after eating
anchovies. She is taken to a ""foreign-speaking"" country. The sound
effect of the foreign tongue seems reversed. When you do play it
in reverse, it becomes: ""It doesn't take a genius to know the
difference between chicken shit and chicken salad.""


""Darling Nikki""
Prince, PURPLE RAIN

""Darling Nikki,"" cited as porn rock before Congress, is about a
dominatrix in a hotel lobby masturbating with a magazine. In part,
the complaint was that the album cover (flowers, and Prince on a
motorcycle) wasn't explicit enough to warn kids of the suggestive
lyrics. Senator Paula Hawkins apparently was not aware of a
backward message hidden in ""Darling Nikki."" The last thirty-five
seconds of the song is gibberish. The music changes abruptly and
becomes a repeated glottal sound. Then a two-syllable sound is
repeated twice, something like ""heaven, heaven."" Unintelligible
speech follows. At the end is a sound reminiscent of rain or bacon
frying , and wind sounds.
     Played backward, the message becomes:

     Hello, how are you?
     I'm fine 'cause I know that the Lord is coming soon.
     Coming, coming soon.

     It is clearly Prince and the Revolution singing this. The
words are clear but the intonation is funny -- the linger on some
words. Perhaps this is to make the reversed message you hear
playing the record normally a little less conspicuous.
     This is a weird reversal of the supposed secret message
menace. Raunchy forward lyrics conceal a religious secret message.


""Judas Kiss""
Petra, MORE POWER TO YOU

Petra is an obscure group that sings religious songs to a rock
beat. As further proof that things have gone full circle, the
backward-masking controversy prompted Petra to include a wholesome
backward message on their MORE POWER TO YOU album. It is in the
transition between two songs, just before ""Judas Kiss."" Clearly
audible gibberish reverses to this (the husky voice a cross
between George Beverly Shea and Dee Snider): ""What are you looking
for the Devil for, when you ought to be looking for the Lord?""

AFL JoyceM Welcome to the Apple II Music & Sound chat - our discussion will
           be on NoiseTracker - the new FTA music program for the GS.  AFA
           Gene will be our host this evening...Gene, the floor is yours :)

AFA Gene   Hi all... well first I'd like to point out, if y'all aren't aware
           yet, that a spanking new version of NoiseTracker has recently
           been released (9 days ago) and is now available in our New Files
           library. It is version 0.5. I haven't played around with it much
           yet, but it's supposed to fix a lot of the little bugs in 0.3
           (the first version we had online).  NoiseTracker also includes
           the ability to directly import ""modules,"" a term used for a
           certain type of Amiga song file which has become popular among PC
           users using the SoundBlaster sound card.

           Now, via NT, these ""MOD"" files are accessible by the GS. We
           expect to see a lot of activity on this end as far as ports from
           the PC and Amiga go. Note that you should be able to go straight
           to the PC music forum and download any recently uploaded MOD
           songfiles (there was a bug in the first wide release of the PCAO
           software, however, so a bunch of files with dates between around
           March 1991 and September 1991 may not download properly. Note that
           to use these PC MOD files, you'll have to rename the downloaded
           file ""MOD.xxxxxx"" if you want it to show up automatically in NT's
           ""open"" dialog box. (On the PC, all MOD files are named
           ""xxxxxxxx.MOD"" instead.)   Also, if the files are packed with ZIP
           compression, you'll need a program from the Communications Forum
           called AGATE -- it's a terminal program that includes the ability
           to unpack ZIP files.

           Now, I guess the best thing to do would be to talk about our
           favorite songfiles... there have been a few complaints, in fact,
           that people were not being ""descriptive"" enough in their file
           descriptions for uploads in describing the songs.

AFC Eddie  ?

AFA Gene   GA ed

AFC Eddie  Once a MOD file is unpacked with Agate, is a file type change
           needed?

AFA Gene   Nope, since all that NT looks for is the ""MOD."" being the first
           four characters in the filename.

AFC Eddie  OK, Thanks!

Deanna7332 Question...

JonL7      Can you list some of the features of Noisetracker?

AFA Gene   (you don't even need that ""MOD."" if you want to type the name in
           directly.)

Deanna7332 Did any of these mod files have anything to do with FTA's ""Module
           A""

AFA Gene   Sure Jon, right after we answer Deanna's question. Deanna, you
           mean ""Modulae?""

Deanna7332 Yes, that's it.

AFA Gene   Modulae was a demo written by FTA last year. (i'll get to you in a
           sec Doors).  It used SoundSmith v0.95 for all it's music. There
           is no connection between MOD files and Modulae by FTA.

Deanna7332 Throughout the demo it said ""Loading modules""

AFA Gene   Those ""modules"" are not the same as Amiga soundfile ""modules"" --
           you see, what Modulae really was was a ""stringing together"" of a
           bunch of neat little tiny demos that FTA had written. So they
           called each little demo a ""module"" and thus the entire demo as a
           whole, ""Modulae"" (fancy plural of module?)

Deanna7332 Ok I understand.  Thank you. :)

AFL JoyceM Latin, Gene :)

AFA Gene   The term ""MODule"" from the Amiga comes from the idea that all the
           stuff needed to play the songfile (all the instruments + the
           sequence file) are included into one file, the ""module.""

TheDoors1  Gene, I have tried to d/l some recent uploaded MODs in the PC
           music area and still the problem exists.

AFA Gene   As I understand it, the problem was fixed VERY recently (correct
           me on this Joyce) and files uploaded as recently as early
           November still might not work depending on the version of the
           PCAO software that the uploader used.

AFL JoyceM Actually, Gene...I was under the impression that it had been, but
           if Doors is still having a problem, then it must not be fixed.

AFA Gene   What date was the file you tried to d/l, Door?

TheDoors1  umm 11/17, around there

AFA Gene   hmmm.... well i can tell you one thing... if it didn't work, don't
           waste your time again later... the problem is in the Apple
           software's method of d/lling files, and there are no plans to
           upgrade the Apple AO software.

AFL JoyceM I will endeavor to get an answer to that PC downloading
           problem/question :)

ThomasK63  i have a quick question... what can you use to unpack amiga mod
           files? On the PC side, that is.

TheDoors1  Agate Thomas

ELECTMUSIC Doors... what happens on after downloading..

Deanna7332 If it's LZHed you can't unless you have an IBM or
           PC/Transporter.

AFA Gene   If GS-ShrinkIt doesn't have that ability, i don't think there
           exists any such utility on the GS.

TheDoors1  What do you mean Elect?

ELECTMUSIC After you download the file... where do you encounter a problem?

TheDoors1  ok, you know when you download the file and at some point in the
           download the file starts to appear on your screen.  That's when I
           cancel it.

ThomasK63  I am sure soething good can be made w/out resorting to Amiga
           files

AFC Eddie  Yes, Doors, I believe the problem is with the PC software it was
           UL'd with.

TheDoors1  yeah Eddie.

GNO Tim    Amiga MOD files are typically compressed using LHarc.  I've
           uncompressed several on my Unix machine at school.

ThomasK63  good time for someone to make a lharc unpacker...

AFC DYAJim someone might be ;)

GNO Tim    Several people are already

AFC Eddie  Can't wait, Jim!

AFA Gene   Jon, did you have a question?

JonL7      The features of Noisetracker :)

AFA Gene   Oh yes... okay, here goes, in a nutshell, from most important to
           least:


AFA Gene   *  ability to import MOD files

           *  ability to import Soundsmith files

           *  ProDOS 8 based

           *  virtually no editing abilities (not a feature but important to
           know)

AFC DYAJim :)

AFA Gene   *  forgot: and the most important feature of all, the ability to
           hold instrument files in regular system RAM instead of DOC RAM,
           allowing for instruments far beyond the regular 64K limit found
           in ALL other GS music programs.

ThomasK63  I'll buy that!

TheDoors1  I have another question...when you're ready.

AFA Gene   GA Doors

TheDoors1  ok..is it true that NoiseTracker will take in soundsmith files and
           play them more clearly

AFA Gene   Well, as far as ""what you hear,"" yes there is a definite
           difference with some instruments. It does NOT play the sounds
           more ""clearly,"" but it just plays them in a different way. What
           many people seem to like about this ""different way"" is that
           sustained instruments (i.e. instruments designed to be played
           in a loop to simulate a long held note) seem to work better (or
           perhaps simply the way they were originally intended to work).

TheDoors1  I see

Deanna7332 Which takes up more space - MOD or NT  w/soundfile ?

AFA Gene   Deanna, it depends a few things, such as how big the sequence is,
           how many instruments you have, etc. Once you have a lot of
           assorted files, it'll probably average out to be about the same
           give or take a hundred blocks on your HD. So it basically depends
           on whether you prefer to have your instruments separate or not.

Deanna7332 Does playing quality differ with either one ?

AFA Gene   Nope. It's exactly the same either way. Loading time is the same
           too.

AFC Eddie  Can NT save songs as MOD files?

AFA Gene   Nope. It has options for Open and Close module, but these are
           still inactive.

AFA Gene   If there are no more questions, I'd like to talk about which NT
           files out there are the ""hottest,"" since this info could be
           useful to many users who are interested in downloading NT/MOD
           files.

           My personal favorite is ""Lambada,"" which is supplied by FTA with
           the program but is available separately on America
           Online.Everything about this file is really impressive except
           perhaps the sound quality of the horn-ish melody instrument.

           What about y'all, what are your favorite NT files?

AFL JoyceM Gene, there is a classical song for NT, but can't remember the
           name, but it is good.

AFC Eddie  I like Dragnet!

ELECTMUSIC So do I Ed

TheDoors1  I like Seven something

Deanna7332 My most favorite of all mod files is Pleasure Principle

AFC Eddie  <--appreciate's Greg's taste!

AFL JoyceM :)

AFA Gene   Deanna, i assume you got that from a local board?

Deanna7332 I got it from the PC forum here.

TheDoors1  I saw it there also

Deanna7332 I think under ""Pleasure""

AFA Gene   Would you be able to upload it here? If it's really that good, we
           ought to have it available directly in our oun NT lib here (BTW
           folks, we will be releasing a new NoiseTracker software library
           soon!)

AFC Eddie  What a Forum!!!

Deanna7332 That sounds great!

AFL JoyceM Gene, do you think it will be possible for synthLAB files to be
           converted to MOD files?

AFL JoyceM MOD files?

AFA Gene   I doubt it, Joyce. The formats are so diametrically opposed in
           their entire basis of their file formats that it wouldn't be
           worth the time for a programmer to develop such a convertor.

Deanna7332 Isn't it possible to move the mod file from the PC forum to our
           music library?

AFA Gene   But..... it might be worth the time for a MIDI File Format to MOD
           convertor, since these two formats are more widely accepted.

Nuzz       they have nothing better to do Gene

ELECTMUSIC Gene.. some interesting similarities with DTune and NTracker

AFA Gene   They lose the file, tho, Deanna. :)

AFL JoyceM In what way, Greg?

ELECTMUSIC Both Prodos 8

Deanna7332 Shhh they won't know a thing :)

ELECTMUSIC I also believe Bill uses a shuttling of sound data between Doc
           Ram and Ram.

AFC Eddie  Interesting, Greg.

ELECTMUSIC Thats how he gets some of the excellent instrument quality

AFC Eddie  But Diversitune has that one distinction:  MIDI input.

AFL JoyceM Deanna, we would greatly appreciate it if you would upload that
           'Pleasure' song to our library :)

ELECTMUSIC Agreed Ed.. one of the factors FTA doesn't like to incorporate
           into their programs.

Deanna7332 I'll u/l it tonight if possible.

AFL JoyceM Thanks :)

AFC Eddie  Thanks, Deanna!

AFL JoyceM I will send Bill B a copy of NoiseTracker + some MOD files...to
           see what comments we get from him (will send when I get back).

AFC DYAJim What ever happened to that diversitune upgrade that was talked
           about ?

ELECTMUSIC That would be interesting Joyce

AFC Eddie  Bill apparently still working on it, Jim.

ELECTMUSIC I am sure he would appreciate the Prodos 8

AFC DYAJim good..

AFL JoyceM Jim...RSN....he was hoping by Christmas (this year), but he is
           soooo busy with his job, who knows?

AFC DYAJim Oh yeah, I noticed the speed calcuation in NT .5 is inaccurate
           :)

AFC DYAJim I recall he has set a lot of Christmas projected dates :)

ELECTMUSIC He was one of the first ""Free Tools"" experts in breaking all the
           rules for economic sake.

AFC DYAJim like for the vaporware DT inst editor like 2 years ago.

Deanna7332 Are there any Christmas Mod or NT songs?

AFC Eddie  Oh yeah, Diversi-Editor!

AFL JoyceM I know, Jim - but that I know he has been working on.

AFC DYAJim he projected Christmas for it, and it never came :)

AFA Gene   Not yet in AMS, but hopefully the Holiday Contest will change all
           that. :)

AFC DYAJim I look foreward to any upgrades..

AFL JoyceM Not that I am aware of Deanna - you have some?  hint, hint

Deanna7332 Nope sorry.  I was hoping there were some that could be u/led
           here

AFC DYAJim I'll be breaking out the xmas tune book rsn.. I should be able to
           midi a few :) (which rules out nt)

AFL JoyceM Question...

AFC Eddie  It would be more appropriate to have a converter from Appleworks
           spreadsheet to MOD than from MIDI!

AFL JoyceM If I got ahold of an Amiga song (MOD) disk...how would I convert
           them for here?

AFA Gene   You mean an Amiga-formatted disk?

AFL JoyceM Yes

AFC DYAJim Ack.. methinks you need an amiga and a null modem cable or a
           modem.

AFA Gene   Methinks Jim is right

AFC DYAJim LOL!!  Design your music in the spreadsheet then import to NT :)
           IT might actually have better editing?!! :)

AFC Eddie  Right!

AFL JoyceM Me thinks he is right.  If I had them upload to me, would that
           work?

AFA Gene   Yep; should work like a charm.

AFC DYAJim Yah.. as long as they're coming from an amiga

AFL JoyceM Great....I will work on that when I get back  (making note now).

AFL JoyceM Gene, will you get some of those files (NT) sent to that area
           tonight?  If so, I will leave the needed message :)

AFA Gene   That's all I have planned for tonight's chat, Joyce. Yep, I'll
           move some files right now.

AFL JoyceM Thanks...

AFL JoyceM Then we should have our NoiseTracker Library by end of the week in
           AMS :)

ELECTMUSIC Gene... quick question:  Are you launching NTracker from a 3.5
           disk?

AFL JoyceM Okay, guys...I will see you all the week of December 11th (may the
           4th) as I am off on vacation.

AFA Gene   Yep greg

AFC JohnC  Where are you going?

ELECTMUSIC Do you encounter out of memory problems

AFL JoyceM Night all...and Gene, thanks for an excellent chat and great
           explanations of NoiseTracker.

Nuzz       Joyce, I have good news for FutureSound owners. SoundConvert will
           support it in the first release

AFC Eddie  Great, Mike!

AFA Gene   Greg, i always keep my RAMdisk at 0 when using noisetracker. Not
           only are

AFC JohnC  Mike...SoundConvert...released?

AFL JoyceM Great, Mike.  When can we get SoundConvert, Mike? and FutureSound
           :)

AFA Gene   there a couple of bugs with memory management, but if you're
           loading in a MOD file that's really big, NT will eat your RAMdisk.

AFC Eddie  Sounds good.

Nuzz       The manual is being ""layout"". Release date should be about 1st
           week of Dec

ELECTMUSIC Tnxs Gene

AFC JohnC  YES.......WTG Nuzz!!!!!!!!

Deanna7332 Yes, why is there on some MOD files a stop somewhere in the middle
           ?

Deanna7332 That's really frustrating!

AFL JoyceM Mike, leave me E-Mail on when and how I can send your the $$ to
           get it.

AFL JoyceM Again...night all

Nuzz       gee John, I had to do something to explain the delay :)

ELECTMUSIC Thanks Gene for a GREAT chat!

AFC Eddie  Yes, Gene!  Great!

AFA Gene   Thanks Greg, 'night!

AFA Gene   thanx, see y'all later :)

Copyright 1987 Bob Szekely.

    John Michael Osbourne, (known as ""Ozzy"" to his fans), has in his long 
career as vocalist for Black Sabbath had his work with the group misconstrued 
as advocating Satanism.  In a 1983 radio special featuring Ozzy, the 
interviewer expressed precisely this point; ""...Ozzy has always been shrouded 
in the darkest of Satanic imagery.  Yet if you really listen to his music, 
you'll find that what he is saying differs greatly from his image....""(1)  Even 
the group's image has often been described as ""occult and diabolic"".(2)

    The important point to remember here is to differentiate between appearance 
and reality.  Although the name ""Black Sabbath"" conjures up images of witches 
and sorcerers paying homage to Satan for the powers bestowed upon them, this 
does not make it safe to assume that the group that went by this name 
necessarily drew the inspiration from the occult.(3)  The closest they ever 
came to it was a gothic horror film featuring Boris Karloff as narrator; they 
adopted their name directly from the name of this film.(4)  Black Sabbath was 
involved in the black arts as much as Karloff practiced casting spells off-
screen.  Tony Iommi, the group's guitarist, summed it up best when he described 
the group as having basically ""...the same appeal as a horror movie.  It's all 
an act.""(5)










    Just as their film counterpart did, Ozzy and Sabbath found the occult 
mythos to be an effective vehicle for powerful social commentary; particularly 
when put in the context of heavy-metal rock and roll.  Ozzy himself noted that 
there are ""...people who pick up my [album] cover[s] and go...'This guy's got 
to be singing about Devil, doom, death and destruction.'  Which is not the 
case....""(6)

    The late Lester Bangs likened the group to Bob Dylan and William Burroughs, 
describing them all as ""...moralists...trying to deal with a serious present 
situation in an honest way....""(7)  Ozzy and Black Sabbath merely bring to 
light the many evils of our world in their work, to try and make us realize 
that we are all victim to their influence.  They hope to make us recognize 
these evils so that we may take up arms against them; a point Ozzy emphatically 
stresses:  ""...one thing everybody has got to understand about Black Sabbath's 
lyrics.  They're not downer lyrics, they're just telling everybody where it's 
at...""(8)  He also cites the group's most controversial tune, ""Black Sabbath"", 
as a response to the ignorant hippie culture still force when the tune was 
written in 1970:  ""The hippies said: 'The world is beautiful man.' (sic)  You 
only had to look around you to see how crappy it was.  It was ridiculous 
listening to that stuff, let alone playing it, so we just wrote about the world 
the way it really was and how it affected us - and we felt better in ourselves 
because we were really being honest....""(9)

    I   1   HAVE YOU EVER THOUGH ABOUT YOUR SOUL-
        2   CAN IT BE SAVED?
        3   OR PERHAPS YOU THINK THAT WHEN YOU ARE DEAD
        4   YOU JUST STAY IN YOUR GRAVE.
        5   IS GOD JUST A THOUGHT WITHIN YOUR HEAD OR IS
        6   HE A PART OF YOU?
        7   IS CHRIST JUST A NAME THAT YOU READ IN A BOOK
        8   WHEN YOU WERE AT SCHOOL?

    II  9   WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT DEATH DO YOU LOSE
        10  YOUR BREATH OR DO YOU KEEP YOUR COOL?
        11  WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE THE POPE ON THE END
        12  OF A ROPE - DO YOU THINK HE'S A FOOL?
        13  WELL I'VE SEEN THE TRUTH - YES I'VE SEEN 
        14  THE LIGHT AND I'VE CHANGED MY WAYS.
        15  AND I'LL BE PREPARED WHEN YOU'RE LONELY

        18  FRIENDS MIGHT SAY 
        19  IF THEY NEW YOU BELIEVED IN GOD ABOVE
        20  THEY SHOULD REALISE BEFORE THE CRITICISE
        21  THAT GOD IS THE ONLY WAY TO LOVE.

    IV  23  IS YOUR MIND SO SMALL THAT YOU HAVE TO FALL
        24 IN WITH THE PACK WHEREVER THEY RUN

        32  SAY YOU DON'T BELIEVE?
        33  YOU HAD THE CHANCE BUT YOU TURNED IT DOWN
        34  NOW YOU CAN'T RETRIEVE.










    VI  35  PERHAPS YOU'LL THINK BEFORE YOU SAY THAT
        36  GOD IS DEAD AND GONE
        37  OPEN YOUR EYES, JUST REALIZE THAT HE IS THE
        38  ONE.
        39  THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN SAVE YOU KNOW FROM
        40  ALL THIS SIN AND HATE.
        41  OR WILL YOU STILL JEER AT ALL YOU HEAR?
        42  YES!-I THINK IT'S TOO LATE.

    In this piece, the group asserts a belief in an afterlife and spiritual 
redemption.  As grisly as the image of a hanged pontiff is, its shock value is 
a necessary part of the message:  They reject religious dogma, stating that a 
belief in God, in one's own heart, is the only guiding light to help one inn 
his life (lines 11/12, 39/40).  Furthermore, the reject religious hypocrisy 
(lines 5/6, 7/8) and peer pressure (verses III, IV) as excuses for not 
accepting God.  To clarify further:  following the crowd does not justify 
shrugging responsibility for one's own actions.

    After re-reading, it becomes obvious that this song is an ascerbic critique 
of atheism; (line 35/36) I refer here again to verses three and four.  In these 
two verses, the picture painted in one of Godless conformity and how it's 
viewed as being as foolish as Paganism.  These lyrics set an example for the 
listener by relating personal experience (lines 13-16).  However, for those who 
cannot accept this the group has no recourse but to condemn them, although 
rather ironically; they hope that their rhetorical loss of faith in the 
listener will open his eyes (line 42).










                           B L A C K   S A B B A T H 



            WHAT IS THIS, THAT STANDS BEFORE ME?
            FIGURE IN BLACK, WHICH POINTS AT ME
            TURN ROUND QUICK AND START TO RUN
            FIND OUT I'M THE CHOSEN ONE.  OH, NO!
            
            BIG BLACK SHAPE WITH EYES OF FIRE
            TELLING PEOPLE THEIR DESIRE
            SATAN'S SITTING THERE, HE'S SMILING
            WATCHES THOSE FLAMES GET HIGHER AND HIGHER
            OH, NO, NO, -- PLEASE GOD HELP ME!
            
                IS THIS THE END MY FRIEND?
                SATAN'S COMING 'ROUND THE BEND
                PEOPLE RUNNING 'CAUSE THEY'RE SCARED
                THE PEOPLE BETTER GO AND BEWARE
                NO, NO!  PLEASE--NO!!
                
                
    The all time controversy winner!  Is this not irrefutably  THE song about 
Black Magic in rock?  It's all so obvious, suffuse with evil imagery; Satan, 
walls of flame, figure in black, and damnation at the end.  Yes, I see the 
images too; it definitely concerns Black Magic.  Then again, Shakespeare's 
Macbeth employed scenes of witches involved in conjurations; does that mean 
that Shakespeare was a warlock?  Poe used to write sardonic tragedies about 
twisted murderers and the bizarre nature of acts, did that make him an evil, 
leering, demented killer?  Did either of them advocated what they wrote about?  
One has to remember that writing about something is not necessarily the same as 
emulating it.  Tony Iommi spoke out quite strongly about this:  ""People are 
bringing us down saying that we are a Black Magic group.  I think they must be










getting mixed up with Black Widow.  We don't do any sacrifices on stage, and 
we're not on a black magic kick.  We wanted to do heavy numbers and the guitar 
riffs we worked out were more suited to evil things than love.  We play songs 
about black magic, but they are more likely to be against than for it.""(12)  

    By now, you're probably asking yourself who Black Widow is, right?  Then 
it's time for a little history:

        Sabbath, before they were known as Sabbath, had the same line-up but 
two earlier names.  The first one was Polka Tulk, which seemed sure to doom 
them to obscurity.(13)  The soon realized this and changed the group's name to 
Earth.  Now, Earth was a blues band at the end of the English blues boom.  As 
if that wasn't bad enough, they soon discovered that not only was there another 
group named Earth, but they had also released a single.  To avoid confusion, 
they changed their name again.(14)  But what made them decide on that name?  
Just ask Ozzy:  ""I just liked the name Black Sabbath because of the succession 
of vowel sounds.(15)  If that sounds ludicrous just consider this:  Sabbath was 
""...the first of the really committed, loud and heavy bands...""(16)  They 
needed a name to match the gut-wrenching power they were developing.  Tony knew 
that he wanted Sabbath to be noticed above all the rest of the British blues 
bands:  ""We wanted something of our own that we'd like and people would like.  
And we wanted something loud!""










    Tony didn't hate the blues.  He'd cut his teeth as a guitarist on the likes 
of The Shadows, Buddy Holly and Django Rheinhardt, developing his own style 
from there.  But he realized the group had no future in the blues:

        'We couldn't keep playing 12-bars forever.  We just got fed up with 
Earth music.  It was jazz, blues stuff.  It was good for practice but nothing 
else.'

    In the late 'Sixties, blues groups were a dime a dozen in Birmingham and 
interest was waning in the blues boom due to the glut of groups.  One man, by 
the name of Jim Simpson, had heard Earth around the Birmingham club circuit and 
understood what they were trying to do.  He decided to take them under his 
wing.  With the aid of his massive record collection, Jim expanded the group's 
horizons in the areas of jazz and blues.  He introduced them to artists like 
Wes Montgomery, Count Basie and Jimmy Rushing.  It was from Rushing in 
particular that they derived the repetitive riff style so readily noticeable in 
their later incarnation as Black Sabbath.

    The Count Basie influence is evidenced in the song ""Wicked World"" from the 
first album; Sabbath drummer Bill Ward uses a ""'sighing hi-hat'...in the manner 
of Basie's drummer Jo Jones.""










    The influence is subtle, almost subliminal.  Yet it is one which was not 
thought capable of hard, 'heavy' rock bands in the late 'Sixties.  Although Led 
Zeppelin and Jimi Hendrix also had their work steeped in blues and jazz 
derivations (Hendrix' ""Third Stone From the Sun"" and Zeppelin's version of 
Willie Dixon's ""I Can't Quit You Baby"" from their first album), neither was 
able to match the intense energy of Black Sabbath.  Iommi has always had a 
preference for music with an original, distinct style of its' own; as an 
example, he mentions guitarists Joe Pass and Alvin Lee as two of his strongest 
songwriting influences.

    It would also be necessary that Sabbath develop a unique, distinctive style 
and image of their own.  Though they had changed their name from Earth to Black 
Sabbath to avoid confusion with the other Earth; at the same time another group 
emerged by the name of Black Widow ""...who WERE profoundly influenced by the 
occult, had a male witch as a patron, and wrote pieces like ""Come to The 
Sabbat.""  Unfortunately, Sabbath was constantly reaping the benefits of Widow's 
publicity.

    Sabbath was a group that never minced words.  If they saw something as 
destructive, they would be sure to rub the listener's face it it.  They did not 
want their point to be missed.

    With their straightforward, sometimes brutal way of looking at things, they 
try to shock the listener's conscience back into awareness.  The imagery of 
""Hand of Doom"", from the Paranoid album, is candid and condemning; it is a 
strong statement against drug addiction and rightly so...

            WHAT YOU GONNA DO?

            SATISFY IN TIME
            
            OH, YOU -YOU KNOW YOU MUST BE BLIND

            NOW YOU KNOW THE SCENE
            YOUR SKIN STARTS TURNING GREEN
            YOUR EYES NO LONGER SEE
            LIFE'S REALITY
            
            PUSH THE NEEDLE IN,
            FACE DEATH'S SICKLY GRIN
            HOLES ARE IN YOUR SKIN
            CAUSED BY DEADLY PIN

            FALL DOWN TO THE GROUND
            FEEL YOUR BODY HEAVE
            DEATH'S HANDS START TO WEAVE
            
            IT'S TO LATE TOO TURN
            YOU DON'T WANNA LEARN
            PRICE OF LIFE YOU CRY
            NOW YOU'RE GONNA DIE
            
            
    Many people felt the group's overall direction was pessimistic and had a 
negative effect on its listener's due to that.  ""Ozzy insisted that if people 
thought he was having a bad effect on the minds of young kids, they should go 
and watch the TV news where real murder and mayhem were a way of life, and 
shown night after night."" (18)

    Sabbath was never negative in their message; they were simply truthful 
about waht they saw as wrong in the world.  If you ""Strip away the horror 
stories, the imagery and the hysteria, (and) turn down the amps a notch...you 
have a well-rehearsed, solid blues and rock band, powered by a dedication to 
well defined objectives.""  On the top of the list of those objectives was 
truth; Sabbath never feared facing that truth squarely, regardless of what many 
people thought of them.

Long, long, time ago,
I can still remember,
When the local calls were ""free"".
And I knew if I paid my bill,
And never wished them any ill,
That the phone company would let me be...

But Uncle Sam said he knew better,
Split 'em up, for all and ever!
We'll foster competition:
It's good capital-ism!

I can't remember if I cried,
When my phone bill first tripled in size.
But something touched me deep inside,
The day... Bell System... died.

And we were singing...

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

Is your office Step by Step,
Or have you gotten some Crossbar yet?
Everybody used to ask...
Oh, is TSPS coming soon?
IDDD will be a boon!
And, I hope to get a Touch-Tone phone, real soon...

The color phones are really neat,
And direct dialing can't be beat!
My area code is ""low"":
The prestige way to go!

Oh, they just raised phone booths to a dime!
Well, I suppose it's about time.
I remember how the payphones chimed,
The day... Bell System... died.

And we were singing...

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

Back then we were all at one rate,
Phone installs didn't cause debate,
About who'd put which wire where...
Installers came right out to you,
No ""phone stores"" with their ballyhoo,
And 411 was free, seemed very fair!

But FCC wanted it seems,
To let others skim long-distance creams,
No matter 'bout the locals,
They're mostly all just yokels!

And so one day it came to pass,
That the great Bell System did collapse,
In rubble now, we all do mass,
The day... Bell System... died.

So bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

I drove on out to Murray Hill,
To see Bell Labs, some time to kill,
But the sign there said the Labs were gone.
I went back to my old CO,
Where I'd had my phone lines, years ago,
But it was empty, dark, and ever so forlorn...

No relays pulsed,
No data crooned,
No MF tones did play their tunes,
There wasn't a word spoken,
All carrier paths were broken...

And so that's how it all occurred,
Microwave horns just nests for birds,
Everything became so absurd,
The day... Bell System... died.

So bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?
Ma Bell why did you have to die?

We were singing:

Bye, bye, Ma Bell, why did you die?
We get static from Sprint and echo from MCI,
""Our local calls have us in hock!"" we all cry.
Oh Ma Bell why did you have to die?

We will have a mighty Party           It was good enough for Sappho
In the honor of Astarte               With her lady on her lap-o
Grab your chiton - don't be tardy     She put Lesbos on the map-o
'Cause she's good enough for me!      With her pagan poetry!

Shall we sing a verse for Venus,    Well the Christians all are humming
Of the Gods she is the meanest,     Cause they say their God is coming,
Cause she bit me on my...elbow      Our God came three times this evening
And it's good enough for me.        And that's good enough for me.

We will worship like the Druids,      Some guys have a circumcision

Running naked through the woo-ids,    An embarrassing incision

We will sing a verse for Loki       It was good for old Jehovah

but She's good enough for me!        And that's good enough for me!       
 
And what about this Bacchus,         Diana is a little spikey
Who lives just to raise a ruckus?    And she is a little dyke-ey
Loosens women so they'll f*** us,    You don't have to be a Psych-e
Well, that's good enough for me!     To know that's right for me!

Lilith wears a lacy nightie        That Bob Larson shrieks and hollers
And She is a little flighty        Fighting demons in his callers
She will get you all excite-y      Save his program: SEND YOUR DOLLARS! 
She's wet-dream enough for me!     And that's good enough for me.

              The Khan is a fink, a fink, a fink,

              With results that you can never see!

              But sing it serial, this ditty Imperial
              And you'll be a bardic whiz!                 (5)

                                             IMPERIUM COMPOUND    
                                             (Atenveldt Verses)

   Now here's a story, a little bit gory,
   A little bit happy, a little bit sad.
   About a drink called Imperium Compound
   And how the SCA's been had!                       

   Chorus: Oh we think, we think, we think,
           The King is a fink, a fink, a fink,
           A figure of respectability
           Rules the Kingdom thru Imperium Compound
           The results are plain to see!

   Mongol Hordemen, those free-living swordsmen
   Subverting the Kingdoms from underneath!
   Have no use for Imperium Compound
   Except perhaps to brush their teeth!

   AltChorus: Oh we fink, we fink, we fink,
              The Khan and the Kink, the Kink, the Kink,
              And the Board, their Great Senilities!
              The Western Irgun, drinks Imperium Compound
              And we're BACK, with results you'll see!    

   Lady Laurel, with Authority Royal,
   Passes and rejects our heraldry
   She needs a swig of Imperium Compound
   Then perhaps she'd deign to talk to me!            

   Lady Trude thought it her duty
   To turn a social wrong into a Right
   Proved her point with Imperium Compound
   And showed that Cheshire Cats can fight!  //and scratch//

   The Board of Directors styled themselves The Electors
   And another con they tried to swing
   Now the BoD drinks Imperium Compound
   So we no longer need a King!                        

   AltChorus: Oh the Bod, the BoD, the BoD,
              It thinks it is God, is God, is God,
              The figure of Supreme Authority!
              And if we O.D.'d on Imperium Compund
              there'd be no need for Royalty!          

   Oh, MEDIEVAL Net, we thought it was all wet
   With witty remarks, and other kinds of sass
   We'll feed our computers on Imperium Compound
   And BYTE the BoD right on its' righteous ass!         

   Good old Duncan was often drunken
   Chasing all the ladies fair
   He bathed himself in Imperium Compound
   Now he has a little savoir faire!                     

                    (more)


  ATEN IMPERIUM (cont.)

   Ioseph of Locksley, never changes his socks, he
   Runs around looking like a Cavalier,
   He stocked up on Imperium Compound
   And he has enough to last for years and years!        

   AltChorus: Oh they forgot, forgot, forgot
              The Locks-e-ly Plot, the Plot, the Plot!
              And it works the best when it is underground!
              It isn't a hassle for a green-and-white tassle
              They're the ones that BREW Imperium Compound!  

   Trelon of the Wood, he was very good, he
   Was a leader that had never been beat before;
   But Caid had Imperium Compound,
   And Imperial Roman Caid won the War!  //with help!//   

   In Tyr Ysgithr, it's regularly whispered there
   That the Kingdom is ruled over by a King    // What's THAT? //
   They're ""democratic"" and quite erratic....
   They've forgot the purpose of the whole damn thing!     

   King Sir Mark von,

** Borders **


SETS & BORDERS
by Marston & Cunningham, AQS

I have had this book a long time.  It has lots of good photos, border ideas and
charts for planning them.  I have found it inspirational and helpful.


QUILTER'S ALBUM OF BLOCKS AND BORDERS
Jinny Beyer

Great black and white illustrations of blocks to give you ideas for blocks and
the shading of the blocks. (re: question on black and white quilts).


BRAID & CHEVRON UPDATED

45 variations of making braid and chevron borders from one traditional pattern.


PAINLESS BORDERS

This book presents 16 cleverly designed quilts and borders in which the border
is pieced along with the quilt.  My favorite is the twisted ribbon border

She provides lots of suggestions for clever and fast cutting/piecing.


** Children **


TENDER LOVING COVERS
by Toni Phillips and Juanita Simonich

This is a WONDERFUL book of children's quilts with great designs,
mostly pieced.  They are crib/wall quilt size but there is no reason
they could not be incorporated into a large quilt, if you wish.  One
quilt is called Wheels & More Wheels and has a tow truck, fire
engine, ambulance, and police car, so it is not strictly trucks.  In
addition to this, there are the following:  Astronaut, farm, cowboy,
circus, zoo, christmas, a school quilt.


GO WILD WITH QUILTS ($19.95)
by Margaret Rolfe
That Patchwork Place

This book has a lot of North American wildlife -- birds, squirrels, owls, black
bears etc.
----
It uses straightline piecing methods (no inset pieces) to create realistic
looking animals and birds (cardinal, beaver, racoon etc.)


PATCHWORK QUILTS TO MAKE FOR CHILDREN
by Margaret Rolfe
Sterling Publishing Co. Inc. New York

I can attest to both of these books as great sources for easily
pieced animal blocks.  The GO WILD book was a great hit when we
had it for the book draw at our guild meeting.  It contains 14
North American Animals (racoon, beaver, ducks etc).
----
My favorite for children.  This book hasas a whole zoo, patterns for many
dinosaurs, farm animals, etc.   In my opinion they are more fun than
traditional blocks and make finding naturalistic fabrics fun too.


QUILT A KOALA
by Margaret Rolfe.
Sterling Publishing

Another fun book.  This one has patterns for pieced blocks featuring native
Austrailian birds and animals.


** Color **

COLOR CONFIDENCE FOR QUILTERS ($24.95)
by Jinny Beyer
The Quilt Digest Press, 1992

This is Jinny's color system based on the use of a master palette of fabric
colors that span the spectrum.  By following the instructions in this book, you
create your own master palette that you can use as a tool for color choices
for all of your future quilting projects.  After creating your own color
palette, you will learn how to create countless color schemes just by taking
small sections of the palette, or by rearranging portions of it.


COLOR DESIGN IN PATCHWORK
by Paula Nadelstern
Dover Publications 1991

Explores how color can be used to vary one and the same patchwork
configuration. Depending on the placement of color and the resulting degree of
contrast, different shapes in a pieced pattern are emphasized and visually
linked.  Usually some shapes combine to form the main unit of design, while
remaining ones are interpreted as background.


COLOR AND CLOTH:  THE QUILTMAKER'S ULTIMATE WORKBOOK ($19.95)
by Mary Coyne Penders
The Quilt Digest Press, 1989

This is another good ""color confidence"" book. Underrated, probably because of
Jinny Beyer's.

STRIPS THAT SIZZLE
by Margaret Miller

My first B&W quilt was made using this book. It is a book primarily meant for
working in color, but I thought the technique worked extraordinarily well for
black and white.  I believe that almost any quilt pattern could be used if you
watch your placement as to shading.


** Design/Designing **


SENSATIONAL SETTINGS
(Over 80 ways to arrange your quilt blocks) ($9.95)
by Joan Hanson
That Patchwork Place  1993

Good book offering a lot of ideas/suggestions for arranging quilt blocks.


QUILTING BY DESIGN
by Marston and Cunningham

Linda asked about how to arrive at quilting designs. I had many of the same
questions, and kept looking for the right book to answer them. This book does
so. I highly recommend it.


ONE-OF-A-KIND QUILTS
(Simple Steps to Individual Quilts) ($16.95)
by Judy Martin
That Patchwork Place 1989

One-of-a-Kind Quilts are structured scrap quilts--everyday quilts that feature
a planned theme or focal area surrounded by blocks made in a variety of
patterns, with the overall design developing as the piece is made.

This book takes you step-by-step through the theme blocks and the background
blocks, covering everything from cutting and construction techniques to the
creative decisions that are made along the way.  Suggestions for completing the
quilts are included.  Master templates and quick-cutting information for the
background blocks are provided toward the end of the book. An excellent book.


THREE-DIMENSIONAL DESIGN ($18.95)
by Katie Pasquini
C&T Publishing, Lafayette, CA  1988

Detailed discussion of how to make objects appear three-dimensional.
Lots of her quilts (in color).


SPEED CUTS
by Donna Poster
Chilton for the Creative Machine Arts Series.

In it there are 1200 quilt blocks (although I would say that there
are only 500 designs but each can be constructed in one of three
sizes 10"" 12"" and 14""). Also, there is a quilt layout section that
shows how many blocks you will need for each size quilt depending on
whether you are putting the blocks together on point, straight set,
with lattice or any combination of these.

Of course, also included is a yardage chart based on the templates to
be used. And the templates themselves are in the back, numbered.
Note:  Blocks are all in black and white.


WALL QUILTS
by Marsha McCloskey
That Patchwork Place, Bothell, WA

A step-by-step guide on how to make wall hangings that will add bold and
beautiful accents of folk art design to many areas throughout the home. It
contains complete instructions and full-size pattern pieces for creating ten
wall quilts based on traditional pieced designs, several of them with matching
patchwork pillows.  Directed to both beginning and advanced quilters, it
includes detailed instructions on all special techniques involved, from
template making, machine-piecing, and hand-quilting to mounting and hanging.


PATCHWORK PATTERNS ($18.95)
Jinny Beyer
EPM Publications, Inc., McLean, VA  1979

This book is written for those who have an interest in using traditional
geometric designs or a desire to create their own original motifs.

It explains in a systematic manner a method of drafting patterns which has, in
large, been put aside, and about which no comprehensive book has been written.
She also explains a few simple drafting techniques which are particularly
useful in making geometric designs.


PATTERN PLAY: CREATING YOUR OWN QUILTS ($24.95)
by Doreen Speckmann
C & T Publishing, Lafayette, California  1993
(Not for beginners)

Introduces you to an easy and fun way to design your own blocks on graph paper,
then put those blocks into interesting quilt designs.  Discusses fabric
selection and the techniques necessary for turning graph paper quilts into real
ones.  Provides scale drawings and photos of some of her favorite quilts,
complete with yardages and size-change options.
------
Down to earth, easy-to-understand method to making your own designs.
Excellent, excellent book.  She writes with a sense of humour and
shows loads of examples to get you thinking.  It's an excellent back
door entrance to a more ""creative"" side of quilting for those technician
types who don't think they ""have"" creativity.


BLOCKBUSTER QUILTS
by Margaret Miller

An unusual approach to setting odd blocks (i.e., block of the month,
friendship blocks, good bye blocks, or blocks that are not all quite the same
size) into a quilt top.  More for the advanced piecer.  Very original.


HOW TO DESIGN AND MAKE YOUR OWN QUILTS ($19.95)
by Katharine Guerrier
Mallard Press, 1991

Good book.


MEMORY QUILTS:  DELIGHTFUL WAYS TO CAPTURE TODAY FOREVER
by Nancy Smith and Lynda Milligan

constructing one for my parents' 50th wedding anniversary.


PATTERN ON PATTERN
by Ruth McDowell

This is an excellent book.


** Fast Piecing/Rotary Cutting Techniques **


TIMELESS TREASURES, A Complete Guide to Rotary Cutting
by Nancy Johnson-Srebo
RCW Publishing

Nancy's instructions are clear and concise, and she shows readers how
to cut almost any shape, while using your rotary cutter and ruler.  Also
included are instructions for specific 6"", 8"", and 10"" blocks.
----
I have found the info in this book really helpful.  She goes through how to cut
a number of pieces: trapezoids, parallelograms, hexagrams, octograms, etc.  The
nice thing about the book, too, is that she shows you how to do it for right
handed or left handed cutters. There is also a section in the book for those
who use metric measurements.
----
I find [this book] indispensable.
She gives clear instructions and illustrations to cut any
shape with the rotary cutter.  Both right and left handed illustrations are
given.  In the middle of the book there is a chart for adding on seam
allowances to any shape.  It gives both the English and Metric measurements.
There are also good directions on pressing.

The last part of the book has color photos of blocks and complete directions
for them including cutting, sewing, and pressing.  She includes which direction
to press the seams. (It was great help to me when I was beginning to make
blocks for the first time.)  My only complaint was that there were a couple of
mistakes in the placement of the color photos to the directions.  Some of them
didn't match but were found somewhere else in the book.

BTW, I took the book to a printer and had them put a spiral binding on it so
that it lays flat and stays open when I am using it.


SPEED CUTS
by Donna Poster
Chilton for the Creative Machine Arts Series.

In it there are 1200 quilt blocks (although I would say that there
are only 500 designs but each can be constructed in one of three
sizes 10"" 12"" and 14""). Also, there is a quilt layout section that
shows how many blocks you will need for each size quilt depending on
whether you are putting the blocks together on point, straight set,
with lattice or any combination of these.

Of course, also included is a yardage chart based on the templates to
be used. And the templates themselves are in the back, numbered.

Note:  Blocks are all in black and white.


ANGLE ANTICS ($18.95)
by Mary Hickey
That Patchwork Place, 1991

Explores the design potential of a rectangle constructed of two contrasting
triangles (called bias rectangle).  It also provides you with a technique for
constructing this rectangle quickly and accurately.  (Most patterns are star
patterns.)


BACK TO SQUARE ONE ($17.99)
by Nancy J. Martin
That Patchwork Place  1988

Great book featuring Nancy Martin's personal quiltmaking techniques (template-
free approach).
----
She shows how to make what she calls a Square 1, Square
1.5 or Square 2. Square 1 is made of 2 triangles. This is what you need for
Ocean Waves. Square 1.5 is made of one big triangles and 2 little ones. Square
2 is made of 4 little triangles. I am making a huge wall hanging that uses all
of these different squares and it is working wonderfully!


STRIP QUILTING ($14.95)
by Diane Wold
TAB Books, Div. of McGraw Hill 1987

I love this little book.  It's perfect for those who are into piecing and
repiecing (seminole patchwork take off).  It's very easy to follow.

It contains complete instructions, including diagrams, cutting instructions,
and a shopping list, for each of the projects illustrated.  Pointers are given
for modifying projects, for adapting patterns from other sources and for
creating your own designs.


SHORTCUTS:  A Concise Guide to Rotary Cutting

That Patchwork Place, Bothell, WA  1991

Basic quick-cutting techniques plus a number of techniques that are expansions
of the basics.


QUILTER'S GUIDE TO ROTARY CUTTING, THE ($17.95)
by Donna Poster
Chilton Book Company, Radnor, PA  1991

Good technical reference book on rotary speed cutting ; Over 1,000 speed-cut
shapes.


ROTARY ROUNDUP
Judy Hopkins & Nancy Martin
That Patchwork Place

Both books (Rotary Riot below) have about 40 color prints of quilts.  These
quilts are made from traditional block patterns and have instructions for
rotary cutting and quick piecing.  Nancy Martin owns the publishing company
that published these two books.
----
I had Rotary Riot, so I had to buy this one too and I'm not one bit sorry.  I
love to get ideas and inspiration from these books and this one is full of
great colors,beautiful quilts.  Their books are the only ones I use when I need
to make bias binding as it shows the flat cut method.  The only times I tried
to do the continuous circle, it ends up in a mess.


ROTARY RIOT: 40 Fast & Fabulous Quilts ($21.95)
by Judy Hopkins and Nancy J. Martin
That Patchwork Place 1991

The authors of this book take 40 traditional blocks that appeal to many
quiltmakers and adapted their construction to template-free techniques.  Begins
with Nancy's basic review of rotary-cutting techniques and information on
multi-fabric quilts.  The pattern section includes step-by-step directions for
forty favorite quilts, all clearly illustrated and written in a Template-Free
format.  Some of the patterns feature bias squares, some cut with 8"" Bias
Square and several use simple strip-piecing techniques.  The patterns are
graded with symbols as to difficulty (beginner, intermediate, advanced).  Judy
has written a section on Finishing Your Quilt and has included some of the
overall repeat quilting patterns for which she is known.  Also included is
information on crow footing, utility quilting and other tacking techniques.


COLORFUL ANGLES
(Triangles, Diamonds & Hexagons With a Contemporary Look)
by Susan Stein
EZ International  1993

This book combines the use of applique, traditional blocks, hand
dyed fabrics and the EZ tools (EZ Angle, Companion Angle, Easy Eight, Easy
Hexagon, Speed grids, trapezoids) to create very contemporary designs.  16
projects.  I think this is a good book.


QUICK & EASY QUILTMAKING ($26.95)

That Patchwork Place, 1993

This book introduces cutting techniques originated by each of the authors.
Teaches the authors' special techniques for making quilts with a variety of
triangular shapes. Organized for easy use.  Good for a beginner. 26 projects

for the tips presented throughout.


COUNTRY QUILTS IN A DAY ($14.95)
by Fran Roen

recipient loved it.


** Finishing **

HAPPY ENDINGS
(Finishing the Edges of Your Quilt)
by Mimi Dietrich
That Patchwork Place 1987

Great book for ideas and instructions on finishing your quilt.
This book belongs in every quilter's collection.


** Foundation Piecing **


EASY MACHINE PAPER PIECING
by Carol Doak
That Patchwork Place

I surrender -- I am a believer.  I attended a workshop last night on
foundation/paper piecing based on this book.  It works, by golly, it works.
What a treat -- and I can turn out such perfectly precise blocks.  It's
wonderful.  If you haven't tried it, you should -- attending a class really
helps because you see how it's done live.


PRECISION PIECED QUILTS USING THE FOUNDATION METHOD
by Jane Hall and Dixie Haywood

I like this book because it offers a good history, well-described theory and
practical examples of piecing on a variety of foundations.  It's well
written and very nicely illustrated with b&w photos, color plates and
instructional line drawings.


** General/Miscellaneous **


SENSATIONAL SCRAP QUILTS
by Darra Duffy Williamson

I like this book, particularly the section on selecting fabrics for scrap
quilts.  I used her idea of making a reference card of all the colors in the
quilt (you take a small piece of each and organize them on a card in a
continuous line from light to dark, ignoring color) and it worked a treat on a
planned scrap quilt I made using about 40 pinks and greys.

QNM did a review and hated it, they said there was nothing new in it. I think
it is well laid out and gives you lots to think about.
----
I learned a lot from this book. First, I discovered D.D. Williamsons theory of
the ""Maverick"" block in quilts using repeating blocks!  That has helped me to
add more fun and excitement to my quilts.  It also has a section on color use
and drafting patterns.  I find I go back and read this book over and over.
Wonderful!


ROMANCE OF THE PATCHWORK QUILT IN AMERICA, THE
by Hall and Kretsinger

(answer to question on pattern for Seven Sisters)  Thi book has a picture of a
""Seven Stars"" block on p. 54 that appears to be a similar, if not identical,
pattern.


STRIPS THAT SIZZLE
by Margaret Miller

My first B&W quilt was made using this book. It is a book primarily meant for
working in color, but I thought the technique worked extraordinarily well for
black and white.  I believe that almost any quilt pattern could be used if you
watch your placement as to shading.


QUILTMAKER'S GUIDE:  Basics and Beyond
by Carol Doak

There is a neat pieced maple leaf pattern in this book. It shows four standard
pieced maple leaves set in a block so that each maple leaf is pointing towards

I would like to list this as a book that several people in my guild highly
recommend as a ""every quilter must have"" book.


QUILT ALMANAC 19xx

These are some of my favorites too. The quilts range from very simple
to very difficult. The patterns are good and I enjoy the biographies.
There's a chapter each year on group quilts or guild quilts and someday
I expect I'll see a QuiltNet quilt featured there!

The window decomposition of e for l = 3 contains five 1-windows, while that for l = 4 has only four, and for each the same number of additional multiplications is required. On the other hand, the 22-ary decomposition of e contains eight 1-windows, requires double the number of additional multiplications compared to the case l = 4, and is thus significantly less favorable.

6.4  Montgomery Reduction and Exponentiation
Now we are going to abandon addition chains and turn our attention to another idea, one that is interesting above all from the algebraic point of view. It makes it possible to replace multiplications modulo an odd number n by multiplications modulo a power of 2, that is, 2k, which requires no explicit division and is therefore more efficient than a reduction modulo an arbitrary number n. This useful method for modular reduction was published in 1985 by P. Montgomery [Mont] and since then has found wide practical application. It is based on the following observation.
Let n and r be relatively prime integers, and let r−1 be the multiplicative inverse of r modulo n; and likewise let n−1 be the multiplicative inverse of n modulo r; and furthermore, define n  := −n−1 mod r and m := tn  mod r. For integers t we then have
t+mn ≡tr−1 modn. (6.8) r
Note that on the left side of the congruence we have taken congruences modulo r and a division by r (note that t + mn ≡ 0 mod r, so the division has no remainder), but we have not taken congruences modulo n. By choosing r as a power of 2 in the form 2s we can reduce a number x modulo r simply by slicing off x at the sth bit (counting from the least-significant bit), and we can carry out the division of x by r by shifting x to the right by s bit positions. The left side of (6.8) thus requires significantly less computational expense than the right side, which is what gives the equation its charm. For the two required operations we can invoke the functions mod2_l() (cf. Section 4.3) and shift_l() (cf. Section 7.1).
 106
This principle of carrying out reduction modulo n is called Montgomery reduction. Below, we shall institute Montgomery reduction for the express purpose of speeding up modular exponentiation significantly in comparison to our previous results. Since the procedure requires that n and r be relatively prime, we must take n to be odd. First we have to deal with a couple of considerations.
We can clarify the correctness of the previous congruence with the help
of some simple checking. Let us replace m on the left-hand side of (6.8) by
the expression tn  mod r, which is (6.9), and further, replace tn  mod r by
tn  − r  tn /r  ∈ Z to get (6.10), and then in (6.10) for n  the integer expression
r r − 1 /n for a certain r  ∈ Z and obtain (6.11). After reduction modulo n we obtain the result (6.12):
t+mn ≡ t+n tn  modr rr 
t + ntn  tn  ≡ r −n r
≡t+t rr −1 r

(6.11) (6.12)
(6.13)
(6.14) (6.15)
Where All Roads Meet: Modular Exponentiation
     ≡ tr−1 mod n.
To summarize equation (6.8) we record the following: Let n, t, r ∈ Z with
gcd(n,r)=1,n  :=−n−1 modr.For
f(t):=t+ tn  modr n
we have
f(t) ≡ t mod n, f(t) ≡ 0 mod r.
We shall return to this result later.
To apply Montgomery reduction we shift our calculations modulo n into a
complete residue system (cf. Chapter 5)
R := R(r, n) := {ir mod n | 0 ≤ i < n} withasuitabler := 2s > 0suchthat2s−1 ≤ n < 2s.Thenwedefinethe
Montgomery product “×” of two numbers a and b in R: a×b := abr−1 mod n,
with r−1 representing the multiplicative inverse of r modulo n. We have a×b ≡ (ir)(jr)r−1 ≡ (ij)r mod n ∈ R,
and thus the result of applying × to members of R is again in R. The Montgomery product is formed by applying Montgomery reduction, where again n  := −n−1 mod r. From n  we derive the representation 1 = gcd(n, r) = r r − n n,

which we calculate in anticipation of Section 10.2 with the help of the extended Euclidean algorithm. From this representation of 1 we immediately obtain
and
1 ≡ r r mod n 1 ≡ −n n mod r,
so that r  = r−1 mod n is the multiplicative inverse of r modulo n, and
n  = −n−1 mod r the negative of the inverse of n modulo r (we are anticipating somewhat; cf. Section 10.2). The calculation of the Montgomery product now takes place according to the following algorithm.
Calculation of the Montgomery product a × b in R(r, n)
1. Sett←ab.
2. Setm←tn  modr.
3. Setu←(t+mn)/r(thequotientisaninteger;seeabove).
4. If u ≥ n, output u − n, and otherwise u. Based on the above selection of the parameter we have a, b < n as well as m, n < r and finally u < 2n; cf. (6.21).
The Montgomery product requires three long-integer multiplications, one in step 1 and two for the reduction in steps 2 and 3. An example with small numbers will clarify the situation: Let a = 386, b = 257, and n = 533. Further, let r = 210. Thenn  =−n−1 modr=707,m=6,t+mn=102400,andu=100.
A modular multiplication ab mod n with odd n can now be carried out by first transforming a  ← ar mod n and b  ← br mod n to R, there forming the Montgomery product p  ← a  × b  = a b r−1 mod n and then with
p ← p  × 1 = p r−1 = ab mod n obtaining the desired result. However, we can spare ourselves the reverse transformation effected in the last step by setting p ← a  × b at once and thus avoid the transformation of b, so that in the end we have the following algorithm.
Calculation of p = ab mod n (n odd) with the Montgomery product
1. Determine r := 2s with 2s−1 ≤ n < 2s. Calculate 1 = r r − n n by means
of the extended Euclidean algorithm.
2. Seta  ←armodn.
3. Setp←a  ×bandoutputp.
Again we present an example with small numbers for clarification: Let a=123,b=456,n=789,r=210.Thenn  =−n−1 modr=963,a  =501, andp=a  ×b=69=abmodn.
Since the precalculation of r  and n  in steps 1 and 2 is very time- consuming and Montgomery reduction in this version also has two long-number multiplications on its balance sheet, there is actually an increased computational expenditure compared with “normal” modular multiplication, so that the computation of individual products with Montgomery reduction is not worthwhile.
However, in cases where many modular multiplications with a constant modulus are required, for which therefore the time-consuming precalculations occur only once, we may expect more favorable results. Particularly suited for the Montgomery product is modular exponentiation, for which we shall suitably modify the M-ary algorithm. To this end let once again e = (em−1em−2 . . . e0)B and n = (nl−1nl−2 . . . n0)B be the representations of the exponent e and
the modulus n to the base B = 2k. The following algorithm calculates powers ae mod n in Zn with odd n using Montgomery multiplication. The squarings that occur in the exponentiation become Montgomery products a × a, in the computation of which we can use the advantages of squaring.
Exponentiation modulo n (n odd) with the Montgomery product
1. Set r ← Bl = 2kl. Calculate 1 = rr  − nn  with the Euclidean algorithm.
2. Set a ← ar mod n. Calculate and store the powers a3, a5, . . . , a2k−1 using the Montgomery product × in R(r, n).
3. Ifem−1 à=0,factorem−1 =2tuwithoddu.Setp←(au)2t. Ifem−1 =0,setp←rmodn.

    Further possibilities for improving the algorithm lie less in the exponentiation algorithm than in the implementation of the Montgomery product itself, as demonstrated by S. R. Dussé and B. S. Kaliski in [DuKa]: In calculating the Montgomery product on page 108, in step 2 we can avoid the assignment
m ← tn  mod r in the reduction modulo r. Furthermore, we can calculate with n 0 := n  mod B instead of with n  in executing the Montgomery reduction.
109
Chapter 6
We can create a digit mi ← tin 0 modulo B, multiply it by n, scale by the factor Bi, and add to t. To calculate ab mod n with a,b < n the modulus n has the representation n = (nl−1nl−2 . . . n0)B as above, and we let r := Bl as well as rr  −nn  =1andn 0 :=n  modB.
Calculation of the Montgomery product a × b à la Dussé and Kaliski 1. Sett←ab,n 0 ←n  modB,i←0.
2. Set mi ← tin 0 mod B (mi is a one-digit integer).

SUICIDE - Methods

1. HANGING
   2 methods
   1. asphyxiation (dangle on end of rope for 10 minutes)
      Time:      5 to 10 minutes
      Available: Rope, solid support 10 foot above ground
      Certainty: Fairly certain (discovery, rope/support snapping)
      Notes:     Brain damage likely if rescued. Very painful depending on
                 rope. Most common EFFECTIVE form of suicide. See later
                 ""Asphyxiation"" section. Someone did this about 10 meters
                 from where I was sleeping once. Worked perfectly.

   2. breaking neck
      Time:      Should be instant if it does break. See previous if not
      Available: Rope, solid support, 10 foot space below, several above
      Certainty: Very certain if the rope/support doesn't break
      Notes:     Minimal danger of discovery (depends on location). Painless
                 if you drop far enough (8 foot is optimum). Make sure that
                 the rope is tied securely to something STRONG!! It has to
                 support your weight MULTIPLIED by the force of the drop
                 (in g). Use a hangman's knot (with the knot at the back of
                 your neck).

2. POISON
   Availability of effective poisons restricted.
   Normally painless, but depends on drug.
   Large danger of discovery because slow.
   Available compounds dangerous, have side effect if survived.
   Fairly common, usually ineffective (depends on drug, dose and luck).
   Takes from 10 seconds to fortnight or more.
   In general, you need to stay away from medical help until you actually die,
   but there are exceptions to this (that have been pointed out in the text).
   Common drugs:

      Cyanide (HCN?)
         Dosage:    50 mg Hydrogen Cyanide gas, 200-300 mg Cyanide salts
         Time:      seconds for HC, minutes Cs (empty stomach) hours (full s)
         Available: very difficult to get hold of
         Certainty: very certain
         Notes:     It helps to have an empty stomach (since the salts react
                    with the stomach acids to form H.C.). A full stomach can
                    delay death for up to four hours with the salts. Antidotes
                    to cyanide poisoning exist, but they have serious side
                    effects (they precipitate cyanide and similarly shaped
                    molecules from the blood stream. This frequently blocks
                    blood supply into toes, ears... so you could lose
                    one or two if you are ""rescued""). What you can do, is
                    instead of taking the salts directly, drop 500mg or so
                    into a strong acid, and inhale the fumes. This will be
                    pure Hydrogen Cyanide, and you should die in 10 to 20
                    seconds.
                    The following is something I saw on the net:
                    ""Hydrocyanic acid is one of the most poisonous substances
                    known; the inhalation of its fumes in high concentration
                    will cause almost immediate death. Hydrogen cyanide acts
                    by preventing the normal process of tissue oxidation
                    and paralyzing the respiratory center in the brain. Most
                    of the accidental cases are due to inhaling the fumes
                    during a fumigating process. In the pure state it kills
                    with great rapidity. Crystalline cyanides, such as
                    potassium or sodium cyanide are equally poisonous, since
                    they interact with the hydrochloric acid in the stomach
                    to liberate hydrocyanic acid. This poison has been used
                    for both homicide and suicide; in recent history, a
                    number of European Political figures carried vials of
                    cyanide salt for emergency self-destruction aand some
                    used them. Death resulted from amounts of only a
                    fraction of a gram. A concentration of 1 part in 500 of
                    hydrogen cyanide gas is fatal. Allowable working concen-
                    tration in most of the United States is 20 ppm. Two and
                    one-half grains of liquid acid has killed. The acid acts
                    fatally in about 15 minutes. The cyanide salts kill in
                    several hours. The average dose of the solution is 0.1 cc.
                    Since this is an extremely rapid poison, rapid action is
                    necessary. Occasionally the victim may make a few voluntary
                    actions before death results or alarming symptoms set in.
                    Death results from paralysis of the respiration. When a
                    smaller dose is taken the symptoms are diziness, headache,
                    and shortness of breath followed by convulsions, coma,
                    and collapse.

3The Story Of Spam - Volume Two3
@DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDY
 
     This is the story of Spam as remembered from a time not
so long ago...And this is how it all began...
 
     One day in a multi-player game called Avatar,
Laecretius, a fine and powerful sorcerer was running one of
the lower levels of the game and roasting and toasting
monsteres like all fine young sorcerers do.  Then he ran into
Ninja -- which instantly trashed Laecretius.  However, before
dying, Laecretius managed to utter ""OH SPAM!"" before hitting
the floor.  All those in the game heard this cry; although
they were completely caught off guard, they managed to adapt
and began to spread the legend of Spam.  It went through many
changes of its form within that day from ""Wand Of Spam"" all
the way to ""You were teleported in solid SPAM"" were heard.
Pretty soon, chaos broke out in Avatar as characters began to
yell out their favorite Avatar items -- and briefly mentioned
that they were made of Spam such as ""Helmet Of Spam"" and
""Spam Bracers"".  Soon after three hours of this, the people
who played the game seriously began to become very annoyed
and uttered, ""No MORE SPAM!"" before turning off the ability
to recieve the messages from other players.  Although this
stopped the Spam slinging for the day...it did not stop it.
In fact, the slinging of the Spam just had begun.  It
continued in Avatar upon unsuspecting characters and players
and in several notesfile.  Soon, even the great Felixmeister
began to hear of the Legend Of Spam, and as soon as that
happened, it was confirmed that Nova began to reproduce the
luncheon meat.
 
     Then Felixmeister the Great zapped the great Avatar game
from existance and put in a so called ""new and improved""
version of the game -- and when he deleted the game, he took
the characters that we knew and loved with it.  However, this
did not cause the death of the Legend Of Spam.  It continued
to spread via the famous words of Raphael Dareau, Crunch,
Merlin, AIESHA, HAMMERCROM, Irongrond, Beth.  All the others
that slung the spam are just insignifigant.  Soon the game of
Avatar Mark II began to immediately fill with Spam.  It
filled up so much it overflowed into other games and other
NovaNET groups such as NHS and RVELKS.  Soon all of
Cherryfield, Maine, and Springerville, Arizona, heard of Spam
via a legendary program called TalkLine, written by none
other than Raphael Dareau and Merlin.  TalkLine, in
combination with it's notesfile =purgatory, made Spam history
as it began to spre

Many thanks to all who responded.

a tag, a banana bag again, or: a camel, a crepe, pins, spam,
a rut, a Rolo, cash, a jar, sore hats, a peon, a canal, Panama!


Here is some information about a few palindromes related to the one
you mention.  As far as I know, the first person to put a cat in the
canal was Jim Saxe, in his 9 October 1983 plan file.

    A man, a plan, a cat, a canal; Panama?

Guy Jacobson added several items later that year.

    A man, a plan, a cat, a ham, a yak, a yam, a hat, a canal--Panama!

Guy's palindrome appears on page 127 of COMMON LISP, THE LANGUAGE
(page 170 of the 2nd edition).  The 2nd edition of COMMON LISP, THE
LANGUAGE also contains the remarkable:

        - A word about user supported software: -

        The user supported software concept (usually referred to as
        shareware) is an attempt to provide software at low cost.  The
        cost of offering a new product by conventional means is
        staggering, and hence dissuades many independent authors and
        small companies from developing and promoting their ideas.  User
        supported software is an attempt to develop a new marketing
        channel, where products can be introduced at low cost.

        If user supported software works, then everyone will benefit.
        The user will benefit by receiving quality products at low cost,
        and by being able to ""test drive"" software thoroughly before
        purchasing it.  The author benefits by being able to enter the
        commercial software arena without first needing large sources of
        venture capital.

        But it can only work with your support.  We're not just talking
        about THE LOVE BASE here, but about all user supported software.
        If you find that you are still using a program after a couple of
        weeks, then pretty obviously it is worth something to you, and
        you should send in a contribution.
